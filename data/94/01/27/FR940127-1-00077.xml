    <textblock>VII. Economic Impact</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA has considered the economic impact of this proposed rule and concludes that it would impose no additional costs on industry or the general public. The value to an individual litigant of having the identities of reporters and subjects of adverse experiences is difficult to estimate; however, litigants will have available the substance of adverse experience reports, which is of greater importance. Although tort litigation could provide substantial economic benefit to an individual litigant, the net gain to health care and public health through efficient and complete reporting of serious adverse reactions greatly outweighs any damage an individual litigant may suffer from lack of access to the names of patients or reporters who are not parties in the litigant's lawsuit. Accordingly, FDA concludes that this proposed rule is not significant as defined by Executive Order 12866 and certifies that this proposed rule would not have a substantial economic effect on a significant number of small entities which would require a regulatory flexibility analysis under the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980.</textblock>
    <textblock>VIII. Environmental Impact</textblock>
    <textblock>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(a)(8) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.</textblock>
