    <textblock>Docket No.:</textblock>
    <textblock>27532.</textblock>
    <textblock>Petitioner:</textblock>
    <textblock>Air Transport Association.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulations Affected:</textblock>
    <textblock>14 CFR 121.343(c).</textblock>
    <textblock>Description of Rulechange Sought:</textblock>
    <textblock>To allow operators to complete a phased compliance schedule for installation of the 11-parameter digital flight data recorders (DFDR) on aircraft between December 31, 1994, and December 31, 1999, and eliminate the need to make costly DFDR retrofit to aircraft that will not be in the U.S. airline inventory at the end of the decade.</textblock>
    <textblock>Petitioner's Reason for the Request:</textblock>
    <textblock>The petitioner feels that this amendment will save ATA operators alone $23,700,000; retrofit installation is not supported via an aircraft manufacturer service bulletin, since the majority of aircraft models affected by the rule are out of production; and any enhancement to the collection of flight history data may be of minimal benefit for the airplanes that are to be retired between 1994 and 1999.</textblock>
