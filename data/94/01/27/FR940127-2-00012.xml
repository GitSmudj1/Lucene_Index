    <textblock>INITIATION OF INVESTIGATIONS:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Petitions</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 30, 1993, we received petitions filed in proper form by five producers of stainless steel bar (AL Tech Specialty Steel Corp., Carpenter Technology Corp., Republic Engineered Steels, Slater Steels Corporation and Talley Metals Technology, Inc.) and one labor union (United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO/CLC) (collectively, petitioners). On January 4, 1994, and January 7, 1994, Electralloy Corp. and the Crucible Specialty Metals Division of the Crucible Materials Corp., respectively, notified the Department that they are also petitioners in these investigations. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.12, the petitioners allege that imports of stainless steel bar from Brazil, India, Italy, Japan and Spain are being, or are likely to be, sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 731 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), and that these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, a U.S. industry.</textblock>
    <textblock>The petitioners have stated that they have standing to file the petitions because they are interested parties, as defined under sections 771(9)(C) and 771(9)(D) of the Act, and because the petitions were filed on behalf of the U.S. industry producing the product subject to these investigations. If any interested party, as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), or (F) of section 771(9) of the Act, wishes to register support for, or opposition to, these petitions, it should file a written notification with the Acting Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the Department's regulations, any producer or reseller seeking exclusion from a potential antidumping duty order must submit its request for exclusion within 30 days of the date of the publication of this notice. The procedures and requirements are contained in 19 CFR 353.14.</textblock>
    <textblock>Period of Investigation</textblock>
    <textblock>The period of investigation is July 1, 1993 to December 31, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>Scope of Investigations</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of these investigations, the term ``stainless steel bar'' means articles of stainless steel in straight lengths that have been either hot-rolled, forged, turned, cold-drawn, cold-rolled or otherwise cold-finished, or ground, having a uniform solid cross section along their whole length in the shape of circles, segments of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), triangles, hexagons, octagons or other convex polygons. Stainless steel bar includes cold-finished stainless steel bars that are turned or ground in straight lengths, whether produced from hot-rolled bar or from straightened and cut rod or wire, and reinforcing bars that have indentations, ribs, grooves, or other deformations produced during the rolling process.</textblock>
    <textblock>Except as specified above, the term does not include stainless steel semi-finished products, cut length flat-rolled products (i.e., cut length rolled products which if less than 4.75 mm in thickness have a width measuring at least 10 times the thickness, or if 4.75 mm or more in thickness having a width which exceeds 150 mm and measures at least twice the thickness), wire (i.e., cold-formed products in coils, of any uniform solid cross section along their whole length, which do not conform to the definition of flat-rolled products), and angles, shapes and sections.</textblock>
    <textblock>The stainless steel bar subject to these investigations is currently classifiable under subheadings 7222.10.00, 7222.20.00 and 7222.30.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheading is provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of these investigations is dispositive.</textblock>
