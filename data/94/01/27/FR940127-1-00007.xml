    <textblock>(g) Remarking of CCOC's with a new P/N in accordance with paragraph (f) of this AD constitutes terminating action to the inspection requirements of this AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>(h) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Engine Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Engine Certification Office.</textblock>
