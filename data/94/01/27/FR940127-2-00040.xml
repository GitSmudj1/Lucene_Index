    <textblock>Title:</textblock>
    <textblock>Contractor's Cumulative Claim and Reconciliation (EPA No. 246.05; OMB No. 2030-0016).</textblock>
    <textblock>Abstract:</textblock>
    <textblock>This ICR is an extension of existing information collection activities required under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) at 48 CFR 4.804 and 4.805. Under these regulations, EPA contractors completing cost-reimbursement contracts must provide EPA with summary information of all costs incurred in the performance of the contract prior to contract closure. Specifically, using EPA Form 1900-10 or an equivalent format, EPA contractors must provide EPA with summary information on the major expenditures under the contract, such as direct labor, direct material and supplies, equipment, travel, and subcontract costs. There are no recordkeeeping requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>This information is used by the EPA to determine the final amount of reimbursable costs to the contractor. The EPA contracting officer reviews and reconciles this information with EPA's internal records. After the information is verified through this audit, a final payment is made to the contractor.</textblock>
