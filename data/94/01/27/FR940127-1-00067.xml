    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to</textblock>
    <textblock>amend its public information regulations to help ensure that the</textblock>
    <textblock>identities of those who report adverse events associated with</textblock>
    <textblock>human drugs, biologics, and medical devices, and the identities</textblock>
    <textblock>of patients are held in confidence and not disclosed by FDA, as</textblock>
    <textblock>provided in current agency rules, or by manufacturers that</textblock>
    <textblock>possess these reports. The proposed rule is intended to preempt</textblock>
    <textblock>the establishment or continuation in effect of any State or local</textblock>
    <textblock>law, rule, regulation, or other requirement that requires or</textblock>
    <textblock>permits disclosure of such identities. This action is being</textblock>
    <textblock>taken to maintain the agency's ability to collect information</textblock>
    <textblock>about safety risks of FDA-regulated products that is vital to</textblock>
    <textblock>protection of the public health.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Introduction</textblock>
    <textblock>A critical public health activity of FDA is to monitor the</textblock>
    <textblock>safety of human drugs, biologics, and devices in the marketplace.</textblock>
    <textblock>As part of postmarketing surveillance programs to monitor the</textblock>
    <textblock>safety of these products, FDA relies heavily on its adverse event</textblock>
    <textblock>reporting systems. These reporting systems are important</textblock>
    <textblock>adjuncts to the product approval process, which is based</textblock>
    <textblock>primarily on testing conducted before a product is marketed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Although preapproval testing provides significant information</textblock>
    <textblock>about the safety and efficacy of a product, not all potential</textblock>
    <textblock>safety problems can be identified in the preapproval stage when</textblock>
    <textblock>the number of subjects exposed to the product and the period of</textblock>
    <textblock>exposure are necessarily limited. For that reason, the receipt</textblock>
    <textblock>of postmarket reports of adverse events associated with a</textblock>
    <textblock>regulated product is critical to the agency's ability to help</textblock>
    <textblock>protect the public health.</textblock>
