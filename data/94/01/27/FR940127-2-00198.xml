    <textblock>(B) Surveys, inventories, and similar studies that have limited context and minimal intensity in terms of changes in the environment; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(C) Testing outside of the laboratory, such as in small isolated field plots, which involves the routine use of familiar chemicals or biological materials.</textblock>
    <textblock>(11) Routine renovation, rehabilitation, or revitalization of physical facilities, including the acquisition and installation of equipment, where such activity is limited in scope and intensity.</textblock>
    <textblock>In order for CSRS to make a determination regarding NEPA, as to whether any further action is required (e.g., preparation of an environmental assessment (EA) or environmental impact statement (EIS)), pertinent information regarding the environmental aspects of the proposed project is necessary; therefore, a separate statement must be included in the proposal indicating whether the applicant is of the opinion that the project may fall within one or more of the categorical exclusions listed above. This statement must include the reasons, with appropriate supporting documentation, as to why the proposed project falls within a particular exclusion or exclusions. If the proposed project falls within one or more of the categorical exclusions, the specific exclusion(s) must be identified. The information submitted in association with NEPA compliance should be identified in the Table of Contents as ``NEPA Considerations'' and the narrative statement with supporting documentation shall be placed at the back of the proposal.</textblock>
    <textblock>Even though a project may fall within the categorical exclusions, CSRS may determine that an EA or an EIS is necessary for a proposed project should substantial controversy on environmental grounds exist or if other extraordinary conditions or circumstances are present that may cause a project to have a significant environmental effect.</textblock>
