    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated January 17, 1994, the President declared a major disaster under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>), as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of California, resulting from an earthquake and aftershocks on January 17, 1994, and continuing, is of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant a major disaster declaration under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act''). I, therefore, declare that such a major disaster exists in the State of California.</textblock>
    <textblock>In order to provide Federal assistance, you are hereby authorized to allocate from funds available for these purposes, such amounts as you find necessary for Federal disaster assistance and administrative expenses.</textblock>
    <textblock>You are authorized to provide Individual Assistance and Public Assistance in the designated areas. Consistent with the requirement that Federal assistance be supplemental, any Federal funds provided under the Stafford Act for Public Assistance will be limited to 75 percent of the total eligible costs except for direct Federal assistance costs for emergency work authorized at 100 percent Federal funding for the first 72 hours.</textblock>
    <textblock>The time period prescribed for the implementation of section 310(a), Priority to Certain Applications for Public Facility and Public Housing Assistance, 42 U.S.C. 5153, shall be for a period not to exceed six months after the date of this declaration.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice is hereby given that pursuant to the authority vested in the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency under Executive Order 12148, I hereby appoint Frank L. Kiston of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to act as the Federal Coordinating Officer for this declared disaster.</textblock>
    <textblock>I do hereby determine the following areas of the State of California to have been affected adversely by this declared major disaster:</textblock>
