    <textblock>. Subparagraph (c)(1) of section 250 provides that the Secretary of Labor, within 30 days after receiving from the Governor a petition for NAFTA-TAA, shall determine whether the petition meets the group eligibility requirement for certification. Upon a determination that the petition meets such criteria, the Secretary shall issue to workers covered by the petition a certification of eligibility to apply for assistance under NAFTA-TAA.</textblock>
    <textblock>ADMINISTRATION</textblock>
    <textblock>. The OTAA will review the State's preliminary finding on all NAFTA-TAA petitions. If an affirmative preliminary finding from the State, based on a shift in production to, or imports from, Mexico or Canada, is confirmed through an independent review by the OTAA, the Secretary will issue a certification of eligibility to apply for assistance. This determination will be published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>If the affirmative preliminary finding from the State is not based on a shift in production to Mexico or Canada by the subject firm or on company imports from Mexico or Canada, OTAA will initiate a customer survey to determine whether the increase in aggregate imports contributed importantly to the workers' separations and to the decline in sales or production at the subject firm.</textblock>
    <textblock>The OTAA will complete the customer survey, and the Secretary will issue a final determination within 30 days of the receipt of the State's preliminary finding.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary's determination to grant or deny certification will be sent by FAX to the State and appropriate regional office. This determination will also be published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>

    <textblock>ADMINISTRATION</textblock>
    <textblock>. When a determination is made by the Secretary of Labor that the petition does not meet the eligibility requirements for NAFTA-TAA, the petition will immediately be reviewed by the OTAA under subchapter A of the Trade Act.</textblock>
