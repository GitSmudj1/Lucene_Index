    <textblock>The Government of Israel (the ``GOI'') wishes to select a financial advisor in connection with the issuance of U.S. Agency for International Development (``USAID'')-guaranteed loans. The USAID-guaranteed loans have been authorized by Public Law 102-391, and are being provided in connection with Israel's extraordinary humanitarian effort to resettle and absorb immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia and other countries.</textblock>
    <textblock>The legislation authorizes the guaranty by USAID of up to $10 billion principal amount of loans over the next five-year period, with a maximum of $2 billion in loans, offered in one or more tranches, to be guaranteed in each of the five fiscal years. This Notice is in connection with the GOI's selection of a financial advisor for an offering contemplated to be made under the five-year authorization.</textblock>
    <textblock>The GOI would like to receive proposals from interested firms on an expedited basis. Proposals must be submitted in accordance with a Request for Proposals available from the GOI, by February 4, 1994.

    <textblock>The selected financial advisor will not be eligible to participate in the underwriting of the guaranteed loans.</textblock>
