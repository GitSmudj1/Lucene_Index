    <textblock>CSX Transportation, Inc._Acquisition of Trackage Rights; the Indiana Rail Road Company; Notice of Exemption</textblock>
    <textblock>The Indiana Rail Road Company (INRD) has agreed to grant CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), approximately 55 miles of overhead trackage rights extending from the CSXT/INRD connection at Bloomington, IN, west to the CSXT/INRD connection at Sullivan, IN. The trackage rights were to become effective on or after January 17, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>The transaction is intended to make permanent a temporary detour arrangement. The detour was necessitated by a washout of a portion of CSXT's rail line near Cloverdale, IN. By agreement, INRD will haul CSXT's cars in INRD trains between Bloomington and Sullivan. CSXT will not exercise the trackage rights unless INRD is unable or unwilling to perform the haulage services called for in their agreement.</textblock>
    <textblock>As a condition to use of this exemption, any employees affected by the trackage rights will be protected under</textblock>

    <textblock>360 I.C.C. 653 (1980).</textblock>
    <textblock>This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(7). If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void</textblock>
    <textblock>ab initio</textblock>
    <textblock>. Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction.

    <textblock>Decided: January 21, 1994.</textblock>
