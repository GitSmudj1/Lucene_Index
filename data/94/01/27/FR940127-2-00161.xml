    <textblock>G&amp;K Automotive Conversion, Inc. of Santa Ana, California (``G&amp;K'') (Registered Importer No. R-90-007) has petitioned NHTSA to determine whether 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300CE (Model ID 124.051) passenger cars are eligible for importation into the United States. The vehicle which G&amp;K believes is substantially similar is the 1990 Mercedes-Benz 300CE that Daimler Benz A.G. manufactured for importation into and sale in the United States, and certified as conforming to all applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>The petitioner states that it carefully compared the non-U.S.-certified 300CE to its U.S.-certified counterpart, and found the two vehicles to be substantially similar with respect to compliance with most applicable Federal motor vehicle safety standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>G&amp;K submitted information with its petition intended to demonstrate that the non-U.S.-certified 300CE, as originally manufactured, conforms to many Federal motor vehicle safety standards in the same manner as its U.S.-certified counterpart, or is capable of being readily modified to conform to those standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>Specifically, the petitioner claims that the non-U.S.-certified 1990 model 300CE is identical to the U.S.-certified 1990 model 300CE with respect to compliance with Standard Nos. 102</textblock>
