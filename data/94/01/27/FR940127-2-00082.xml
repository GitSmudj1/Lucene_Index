    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed meetings are for the purpose of panel review, discussion, evaluation and recommendation on applications for financial assistance under the National Foundation on the Arts the Humanities Act of 1965, as amended, including discussion of information given in confidence to the agency grant applicants.
