    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicants' Representations</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Equitable Variable is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States (``Equitable Life''). Both companies are licensed to conduct business in all fifty states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and the District of Columbia.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. SA-1 and SA-FP are registered unit investment trusts under the 1940 Act. SA-1 funds Equitable's scheduled premium variable life insurance contracts and SA-FP funds Equitable's flexible premium variable life insurance contracts (``Equitable Variable Contracts''). The Equitable Variable Contracts are registered under the Securities Act of 1933 (``1933 Act''). SA-1 has seven investment divisions (``SA-1 Divisions'') and SA-FP has ten divisions (``SA-FP Divisions''). Each Division invests in shares of a corresponding portfolio of the Hudson Trust. Therefore, SA-1 and SA-FP each have a Short-Term World Income Division (``World Income Division''), that invests exclusively in shares of the World Income Portfolio, and an Intermediate Government Securities Division (``Government Securities Division''), that invests exclusively in shares of the Government Securities Portfolio.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The Hudson Trust is an open-end management investment company of the series type as described in Rule 18f-2 under the 1940 Act and has filed a registration statement under the 1933 Act and the 1940 Act, which became effective March 26, 1985. The Hudson Trust has twelve different portfolios (``Hudson Trust Portfolios'') that are used by the corresponding SA-1 and SA-FP Divisions as investment vehicles in connection with the Contracts. The Hudson Trust Portfolios are managed by Alliance Capital Management L.P. (``Alliance''), a subsidiary of ACMC, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Equitable.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. All shares of the World Income Portfolio currently are owned by the Separate Accounts. Of these shares, approximately 50% were acquired by Equitable Variable's general account in exchange for ``seed money'' contributed upon commencement of the World Income Portfolio's operations on April 1, 1991. All other shares of this Portfolio are attributable to Equitable Variable Contracts and are, thus, owned by the Separate Accounts.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. The fundamental investment objective of each of the World Income Portfolio and the Government Securities Portfolio is high current income consistent with relative stability of principal through investment primarily in fixed income securities. The World Income Portfolio invests in high quality short-term fixed income instruments denominated in a variety of currencies, with at least 20% of its invested assets in U.S. dollar-denominated instruments. The Government Securities Portfolio invests primarily in U.S. Government debt securities with secondary investments in repurchase agreements and forward commitments related to U.S. Government Securities.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. Total net assets as of June 30, 1993 were $289.3 million for the Government Securities Portfolio and $10.4 million for the World Income Portfolio. There were 2,442 Contractowners participating in the World Income Divisions of the Separate Accounts.</textblock>
    <textblock>7. The Hudson Trust pays Alliance an investment advisory fee at the following annual percentages of the value of each Affected Portfolio's daily net assets:</textblock>
