    <textblock>The Telecommunications Basket is a static portfolio consisting of 24 equity securities listed as: (1) Common shares outside of the United States in the countries having the greatest exchange trading volume for the shares; (2) common shares in the United States; or (3) as American Depositary Receipts (``ADRs'') in the United States. An ADR is a negotiable receipt which is issued by a depositary, generally a bank, representing shares of a foreign issuer that have been deposited and are held, on behalf of holders of the ADRs, at a custodian bank in the foreign issuer's home country. The securities which comprise the Telecommunications Basket are securities issued by corporations formed under Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, France, Hong Kong, Israel, Italy, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Philippines, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, the United States, and the United Kingdom.</textblock>

    <textblock>Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change states that: (i) if the entity that is used to calculate the value of the Telecommunications Basket is required to use the bid and offer price for a portfolio security to determine the market price of such portfolio security, then that entity shall not use any bid or offer price announced by Lehman Brothers or any affiliate of Lehman Brothers; and (ii) Lehman Brothers will monitor the volatility of the Telecommunications Basket securities and will discuss with the Commission the need to increase the frequency of portfolio value dissemination if the volatility of the Telecommunications Basket increases materially.
