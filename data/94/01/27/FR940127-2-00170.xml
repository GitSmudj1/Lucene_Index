    <textblock>Objectives of the Mongolian Citizen Action Groups Project</textblock>
    <textblock>Overview</textblock>
    <textblock>While Mongolia's formal governmental institutions continue their transition to democracy, its private sector is moving at a slower pace. Community action groups and arts councils are in a formative stage, with little understanding of their potential roles and opportunities in a democratic society. Fund-raising and techniques advocating change outside governmental channels are almost unknown. This project focuses on facilitating the development of new citizen groups and associations, providing information to leaders who are eager to create these institutions and consortia. The development of citizen action groups should respond to the needs and interests of the people of Mongolia. U.S. support is designed to provide an array of information or models from which Mongolian citizen activists may wish to choose. USIA encourages proposals that feature ``train and trainers'' models; the creation of indigenous training centers; schemes to create professional networks or professional associations to disseminate information; and other enduring aspects.</textblock>
    <textblock>Projects may include: study tours in the U.S. for small groups; short-term, non-technical workshops conducted in Mongolia; four- to ten-week internships in the U.S.; planning trips or consultations in Mongolia; and the development of specialized training materials.</textblock>
    <textblock>Programmatic Considerations</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to the Bureau's authorizing legislation, grant programs must maintain a non-political character and should be balanced and representative of the diversity of American political, social and cultural life. Proposals must be for projects that enhance the growth of indigenous, non-governmental, professional, civic, philanthropic, or issue-oriented institutions and citizen exchange organizations. They should serve as an important avenue for community participation in problem solving, quality of life enhancement, and professional development.</textblock>
    <textblock>All proposals should demonstrate:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) In-depth, substantive knowledge of the relevant issues;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Established connections with partner institutions;</textblock>
