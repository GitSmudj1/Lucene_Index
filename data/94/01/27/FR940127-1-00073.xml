    <textblock>Section 519 of the act requires device manufacturers,</textblock>
    <textblock>distributors, importers, and user facilities to submit to FDA</textblock>
    <textblock>reports of certain adverse events to ensure the safety and</textblock>
    <textblock>effectiveness of devices. FDA has implemented this provision in</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations establishing mandatory reporting requirements for</textblock>
    <textblock>manufacturers, importers, and distributors (21 CFR part 803).</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA also has proposed regulations establishing reporting</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements for user facilities (see the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of</textblock>
    <textblock>November 26, 1991 (56 FR 60024)).</textblock>
    <textblock>Under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act (42</textblock>
    <textblock>U.S.C. 262(d)), biological products are licensed in accordance</textblock>
    <textblock>with regulations ``designed to insure the continued safety,</textblock>
    <textblock>purity, and potency'' of these products. Under FDA's implementing</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations, a biological product license may be revoked if the</textblock>
    <textblock>product does not conform to applicable standards or is not safe</textblock>
    <textblock>and effective (21 CFR 601.5(b)). The agency's proposed biologics</textblock>
    <textblock>adverse experience reporting regulations would establish</textblock>
    <textblock>mandatory reporting requirements for manufacturers of most</textblock>
    <textblock>biological products (see the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of March 29, 1990</textblock>
    <textblock>(55 FR 11611)).</textblock>
    <textblock>Although these reporting requirements are or will be mandatory for manufacturers, device distributors, and device user facilities, these required reports ultimately rely upon voluntary reporting by health professionals. Manufacturers cannot report adverse events if they do not find out about them from the health professionals who observed or were advised of the events. As stated in section II. of this document, disclosure of patient or reporter identities serves as a significant disincentive for voluntary reporting by health professionals. Preempting State and local disclosure laws and rules that permit or require such disclosure would remove a significant impediment to FDA's ability to implement postmarketing surveillance programs that are essential to the public health.</textblock>
    <textblock>Furthermore, sections 505(k) and 519 of the act provide that regulations and orders issued with respect to postmarketing reporting requirements ``shall have due regard for the professional ethics of the medical profession and the interests of patients *␣*␣*'' (21 U.S.C. 355(k) and 360i). The confidentiality of the physician-patient relationship is a basic tenet of medical ethics. The AMA Code of Ethics requires that, with certain limited exceptions, ``(t)he utmost effort and care must be taken to protect the confidentiality of all medical records'' (``1992 Code of Medical Ethics, Annotated Current Opinions,'' Section 5.07; and see the ``1991 Standards of Clinical Nursing Practice of the American Nursing Association''). The recent AMA opinion that physicians have an ethical obligation to report adverse drug or device events is likely to be incorporated in medical practice if confidentiality can be ensured (Ref. 11).</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA firmly believes that the public health interest in securing information from health professionals about potential hazards associated with marketed products far outweighs the interest an individual plaintiff may assert to obtain reporters' identities in private tort actions.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA recognizes the sophistication and complexity of private tort litigation in the United States and the proposed preemption action is not intended to frustrate or impede tort litigation in this area. Indeed, FDA recognizes that product liability plays an important role in consumer protection. The proposed regulation has been drafted to permit any individual plaintiff who experienced an adverse event and subsequently has become involved in medical malpractice litigation with the person who reported the event to obtain all the information contained in the adverse event report. In this situation, where both parties to the litigation know each other's identities, the interests of the parties in protecting this information is minimized and, therefore, would not impose a significant disincentive to reporting.</textblock>
