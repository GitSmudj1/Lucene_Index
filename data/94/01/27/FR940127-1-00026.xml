    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to designate critical habitat for the threatened marbled murrelet (</textblock>
    <textblock>Brachyramphus marmoratus marmoratus</textblock>
    <textblock>) in Washington, Oregon, and California under the Endangered Species Act, as amended (Act). The marbled murrelet is a small seabird of the Alcidae family that forages in the near-shore marine environment and nests in large trees in coniferous forest along the coast.</textblock>
    <textblock>Proposed critical habitat units are located on Federal lands. This proposed critical habitat designation would result in additional protection requirements under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that are funded, authorized, or carried out by Federal agencies. Section 4 of the Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat on the basis of the best scientific information available and to consider the economic and other relevant impacts of including particular areas in the designation.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Previous Federal Action</textblock>
    <textblock>On January 15, 1988, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) received a petition to list the marbled murrelet (</textblock>
    <textblock>Brachyramphus marmoratus marmoratus</textblock>
    <textblock>) in Washington, Oregon, and California as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). On October 17, 1988 (53 FR 40479), the Service published a finding that the petition had presented substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. Because of the increased research effort and new information available, the status review period was reopened, with the concurrence of the petitioners, from March 5, 1990, through May 31, 1990 (55 FR 4913).</textblock>
    <textblock>On June 20, 1991 (56 FR 28362), the Service published a proposal to list the marbled murrelet in Washington, Oregon, and California as a threatened species. The comment period was reopened for 30 days on January 30, 1992 (57 FR 3804), to gather the most updated information on the species. Following a court order by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington denying a 6-month extension, the Service published the final rule listing the marbled murrelet in Washington, Oregon, and California as a threatened species on October 1, 1992 (57 FR 45328).</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 2, 1993, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington granted a motion by the plaintiffs in</textblock>
    <textblock>Marbled Murrelet</textblock>
    <textblock>v.</textblock>
    <textblock>Babbitt</textblock>
    <textblock>to compel a proposed designation of critical habitat. In the ruling, the court ordered the Secretary to propose designating critical habitat for the marbled murrelet no later than January 21, 1994, and to make a final designation of critical habitat as soon as reasonably possible under applicable law.</textblock>
    <textblock>Ecological Considerations</textblock>
    <textblock>The marbled murrelet (</textblock>
    <textblock>Brachyramphus marmoratus</textblock>
    <textblock>) is a small seabird of the Alcidae family. The North American subspecies (</textblock>
    <textblock>Brachyramphus marmoratus marmoratus</textblock>
    <textblock>) ranges from the Aleutian Archipelago in Alaska eastward to Cook Inlet, Kodiak Island, Kenai Peninsula, and Prince William Sound, south along the coast through the Alexander Archipelago of Alaska, British Columbia, Washington, and Oregon to central California. Some wintering birds are found in southern California. A separate subspecies (</textblock>
    <textblock>Brachyramphus marmoratus perdix</textblock>
    <textblock>) occurs in Asia.</textblock>
