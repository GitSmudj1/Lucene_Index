    <textblock>In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47910), the Office of Hydropower Licensing (OHL) has reviewed the application for amendment of license to install a microturbine at the Boulder Creek Project. This project is located on Boulder Creek in Garfield County, Utah. The staff of OHL's Division of Project Compliance and Administration prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the action. In the EA, the staff concludes that construction and operation of the microturbine would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.</textblock>
    <textblock>Copies of the EA are available for review in the Reference and Information Center, room 3308, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.</textblock>
