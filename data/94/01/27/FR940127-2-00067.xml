    <textblock>Maine Central Railroad Company (MEC) has filed a notice of exemption under 49 CFR part 1152 subpart F_</textblock>
    <textblock>Exempt Abandonments</textblock>
    <textblock>to abandon two segments of its Mountain Division line (1) between milepost 51.11, near Conway, and milepost 67.00, near Bartlett and (2) between milepost 90.00, near Carroll, and milepost 103.16, near Whitefield, a distance of 29.05 miles, in Coos and Carroll Counties, NH.</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>MEC has certified that: (1) no local traffic has moved over the line for at least 2 years; (2) overhead traffic, if any, which previously moved over the line has been rerouted over other lines; (3) no formal complaint filed by a user of rail service on the line (or a state or local government entity acting on behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line either is pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has been decided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period; and (4) the requirements at 49 CFR 1105.7 (environmental reports), 49 CFR 1105.8 (historic report), 49 CFR 1105.11 (transmittal letter), 49 CFR 1105.12 (newspaper publication), and 49 CFR 1152.50(d)(1) (notice to governmental agencies) have been met.</textblock>
    <textblock>As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employee affected by the abandonment shall be protected under</textblock>
    <textblock>Oregon Short Line R. Co._Abandonment_Goshen,</textblock>
    <textblock>360 I.C.C. 91 (1979). To address whether this condition adequately protects affected employees, a petition for partial revocation under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) must be filed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistance (OFA) has been received, this exemption will be effective on February 26, 1994, unless stayed pending reconsideration. Petitions to stay that do not involve environmental issues,</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>

    <textblock>A copy of any petition filed with the Commission should be sent to applicant's representative: Kevin J. O'Connell, Iron Horse Park, North Billerica, MA 01862.</textblock>
    <textblock>If the notice of exemption contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void</textblock>
    <textblock>ab initio.</textblock>
    <textblock>MEC has filed an environmental report which addresses the abandonment's effects, if any, on the environment and historic resources. The Section of Energy and Environment (SEE) will issue an environmental assessment (EA) by February 1, 1994. Interested persons may obtain a copy of the EA by writing to SEE (room 3219, Interstate Commerce Commission, Washington, DC 20423) or by calling Elaine Kaiser, Chief of SEE, at (202) 927-6248. Comments on environmental and historic preservation matters must be filed within 15 days after the EA is available to the public.</textblock>
    <textblock>Environmental, historic preservation, public use, or trail use/rail banking conditions will be imposed, where appropriate, in a subsequent decision.</textblock>
    <textblock>Decided: January 21, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings.</textblock>
