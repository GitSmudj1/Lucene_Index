    <textblock>January 19, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 8, 1993, the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (``NYSE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')</textblock>
    <textblock>and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,</textblock>
    <textblock>a proposed rule change to increase continuing listing fees.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33317 (December 10, 1993), 58 FR 66045 (December 17, 1993). No comments were received on the proposal.</textblock>
    <textblock>Currently, the Exchange's listing fees include an original listing fee, an initial fee, and continuing annual listing fees.</textblock>
    <textblock>The NYSE is instituting a rate increase with respect to continuing listing fees as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>The NYSE states that the purpose of the increase to continuing listing fees is to offset in part the increased costs of supplying services provided by the Exchange. These costs include manpower, automation, utilities and other costs associated with providing marketplace facilities and services.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, with the requirements of section 6(b).</textblock>
    <textblock>In particular, the Commission believes the proposal is consistent with the section 6(b)(4) requirements that the rules of an exchange provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable dues, fees, and other charges among its members, issuers, and other persons using the Exchange's facilities.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission believes that the increases in continuing listing fees are equitable because the increases should not result in an excessive allocation of NYSE fees on its issuers as opposed to members and other persons using its facilities. The Commission further finds that the fees are reasonable because the Exchange has proposed the increases to offset rising costs. Accordingly, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to approve the proposed rule change.</textblock>
    <textblock>It is therefore ordered,</textblock>
    <textblock>pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,</textblock>
    <textblock>that the proposed rule change (SR-NYSE-93-42) is approved.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.</textblock>
