    <textblock>[Amended]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:</textblock>
    <textblock>Pratt &amp; Whitney:</textblock>
    <textblock>Docket No. 93-ANE-81.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability:</textblock>
    <textblock>Pratt &amp; Whitney (PW) Models JT8D-1,</textblock>
    <textblock>-1A, -1B, -7, -7A, -7B, -9, -9A, -11, -15, -15A, -17, -17A, -17R, and -17AR turbofan engines, with combustion chamber outer case (CCOC), Part Number (P/N) 796761 or 806675. These engines are installed on but not limited to Boeing 727 and 737 series, and McDonnell Douglas DC-9 series aircraft.</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance:</textblock>
    <textblock>Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.</textblock>
    <textblock>To prevent rupture of the CCOC, which could result in fire, engine cowl release, or aircraft damage, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Except for CCOC's cited in paragraph (c) of this airworthiness directive (AD), ultrasonically inspect CCOC's installed in engines for cracks within 10 days or 75 cycles in service (CIS) after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later, in accordance with paragraph 2.A.(3) and Appendix B of PW Alert Service Bulletin (ASB) No. 5842, Revision 3, dated October 10, 1990.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) For CCOC's not installed in engines and not cited in paragraph (c) of this AD, ultrasonically inspect CCOC's for cracks prior to returning the CCOC's to service in accordance with paragraph 2.A.(5) and Appendix C of PW ASB No. 5842, Revision 3, dated October 10, 1990.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) For CCOC's, P/N 806675, listed by serial number in Table 1 and paragraph 2.A.(10) of PW ASB No. 5842, Revision 3, dated October 10, 1990, accomplish the following:</textblock>

    <textblock>(2) Remove from service or reinspect CCOC's in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e), respectively, of this AD.</textblock>

    <textblock>(i) Have accumulated at least 2,500 CIS since new; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Exhibit a maximum ultrasonic signal amplitude of less than 40% during the inspection conducted subsequent to 2,500 CIS since new.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Remove from service and replace with a serviceable part CCOC's with maximum ultrasonic signal amplitude determined as follows:</textblock>
