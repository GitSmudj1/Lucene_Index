    <textblock>In the January 6, 1994,</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>notice for the proposed water quality standards, EPA published its intent to hold public hearings during the week of February 21, 1994, in Fresno, California; Sacramento, California; and San Francisco, California. After further consideration, it was decided to add a fourth hearing in the Los Angeles, California area in order to expand the public's opportunity to comment on these proposals.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subsection 4(b)(5)(E) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>), requires that the Service hold a public hearing, if it is requested within 45 days of the publication of a proposed rule. In anticipation of public hearing requests, the Service announces a joint effort with EPA to hold four public hearings in California on three related components of an interagency plan that addresses management of water and fish and wildlife resources in the California estuary.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Service and EPA have jointly scheduled four public hearings: (1) February 23, 1994, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Holiday Inn Center Plaza, 2233 Ventura Avenue, Fresno, California; (2) February 24, 1994, from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Expo Inn, 1413 Howe Avenue, Sacramento, California; (3) February 25, 1994, from 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. at the EPA Regional Office, 75 Hawthorne Street, San Francisco, California; and (4) February 28, 1994, from 9 a.m. to 12 noon and from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. at the Irvine City Hall, 1 Civic Center Plaza, Irvine, California.</textblock>
    <textblock>Those parties wishing to make statements for the record should bring copies of their statements to present to EPA and the Service at the start of the hearings. Oral statements may be limited in length if the number of parties present at the hearings necessitates such a limitation. There are, however, no limits to the length of written comments or materials presented at the hearing or mailed to the respective agencies. Written comments carry the same weight as oral comments.</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA's January 6, 1994, notice set the due date for all written comments related to their proposed rule for March 11, 1994. The comment periods on the two Service proposed rules are extended to March 11, 1994. Written comments should be submitted to EPA or the Service at their respective offices given above in the</textblock>
