    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Service proposes to list the spruce-fir moss spider (</textblock>
    <textblock>Microhexura montivaga</textblock>
    <textblock>) as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This spider is currently known from four mostly small populations located in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee. The spider's damp high-elevation forest habitat is deteriorating rapidly due primarily to air pollution and exotic insects. The species' current low numbers also increase its vulnerability to harm from other threats. Listing</textblock>
    <textblock>Microhexura montivaga</textblock>
    <textblock>as an endangered species would provide protection under the Act.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The spruce-fir moss spider was originally described by Crosby and Bishop (1925) based on collections made from a site in western North Carolina in 1923 (Coyle 1981). Only a few specimens were taken, and little was known about the species until its rediscovery approximately 50 years later by Dr. Frederick Coyle (Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, North Carolina) and Dr. William Shear (Hampden-Sydney College, Hampden-Sydney, Virginia) (Coyle 1981).</textblock>
    <textblock>Microhexura montivaga</textblock>
    <textblock>is one of only two species belonging to the genus</textblock>
    <textblock>Microhexura</textblock>
    <textblock>in the family</textblock>
    <textblock>Dipluridae</textblock>
    <textblock>(Coyle 1981; Harp 1991, 1992). The other species in the genus,</textblock>
    <textblock>M. idahoana</textblock>
    <textblock>, occurs only in the Pacific Northwest (Coyle 1981). Diplurids belong in the primitive suborder</textblock>
    <textblock>Mygalomorphae,</textblock>
    <textblock>which are often popularly referred to as ``tarantulas'' (Harp 1991, 1992). The genus</textblock>
    <textblock>Microhexura</textblock>
    <textblock>is the northernmost representative of the family</textblock>
    <textblock>Dipluridae</textblock>
    <textblock>and is also one of the smallest of the mygalomorph spiders, with adults measuring only 3.0 to 5.6 millimeters (roughly 1/4 to 7/16 inch) (Coyle 1981). Coloration of</textblock>
    <textblock>M. montivaga</textblock>
    <textblock>ranges from light brown to a darker reddish brown, and there are no markings on the abdomen (Harp 1992). The carapace is generally yellowish brown (Harp 1992). The most reliable field identification characteristics for the spruce-fir moss spider are a pair of very long posterior spinnerets and the presence of a second pair of book lungs, which appear as light patches posterior to the genital furrow (Harp 1992).</textblock>
    <textblock>The typical habitat of the spruce-fir moss spider is found in well-drained moss (and liverwort) mats growing on rocks or boulders, in well-shaded situations in mature, high-elevation Fraser fir (</textblock>
    <textblock>Abies fraseri</textblock>
    <textblock>) and red spruce (</textblock>
    <textblock>Picea rubens</textblock>
    <textblock>) forests (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992). The moss mats cannot be too dry (the species is very sensitive to desiccation) or too wet (large drops of water can also pose a threat to the spider) (Harp 1992). The spider constructs its tube-shaped webs in the interface between the moss mat and rock surface (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992), though occasionally the web extends into the interior of the moss mat (Harp 1992). The tubes are thin-walled and typically broad and flattened with short side branches (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992). There is no record of prey having been found in the webs of the spruce-fir moss spider nor has the species been observed taking prey in the wild, but the abundant springtails (collembolans) in the moss mats provide the most likely source of food for the spider (Coyle 1981, Harp 1992).</textblock>
    <textblock>Males of the species mature during September and October, and females are known to lay eggs in June. The egg sac is thin-walled and nearly transparent, and it may contain seven to nine eggs. The female remains with the egg sac and, if disturbed, will carry the egg sac with her fangs. Spiderlings emerge in September (Coyle 1981). The means of dispersal of the spiderlings from the parental moss mat is not known, but ``ballooning,'' a process by which the spiders use a sheet of silk played out into the wind to carry them into the air, has been suggested as a possible means of long-range dispersal (Harp 1992). The life span of the species is also unknown, but Coyle (1981) estimated that it may take 4 years for the species to reach maturity.</textblock>
