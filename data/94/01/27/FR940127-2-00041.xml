    <textblock>Title:</textblock>
    <textblock>Land Disposal Restrictions No-Migration Variances. (EPA No. 1353.04; OMB No. 2050-0062). This ICR is a renewal of an approved collection.</textblock>
    <textblock>Abstract:</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 3004 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended by the Hazardous and Solid Waste Amendments of 1984, prohibits land disposal of hazardous wastes beyond specified dates unless the owner/operator of a hazardous waste storage or disposal facility demonstrates to the Administrator of EPA that there will be no migration of hazardous constituents from the land disposal unit for as long as the waste remains hazardous. The regulated community can petition for a variance from statutory prohibitions or treatment requirements promulgated under section 3004, to continue land disposal of specific hazardous wastes at specific facilities. The requirements for obtaining these variances and the associated costs are discussed in detail in the ICR.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Permits and State Programs Division, Office of Solid Waste, will review the petitions and determine if they successfully demonstrate no migration. Granting of a variance will be based upon successful demonstration that hazardous wastes can be managed safely in a particular land disposal unit, so that no migration of any hazardous constituents occurs from the unit for as long as the waste remains hazardous. The statutory requirement for an application by an interested person is intended to place the burden on the applicant to prove that a specified waste can be contained safely in a particular type of disposal unit.</textblock>

    <textblock>The respondent burden for the no-migration petition is estimated to be 9,240 hours for each facility planning to request a variance.</textblock>
