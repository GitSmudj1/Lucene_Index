    <textblock>13. Bigleaf Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla)</textblock>
    <textblock>American mahogany, the genus</textblock>
    <textblock>Swietenia,</textblock>
    <textblock>is native to the neotropics (56 FR 33898-33899, July 24, 1991). Two of the three species in this genus are listed in CITES Appendix II:</textblock>
    <textblock>Swietenia humilis</textblock>
    <textblock>(Pacific Coast mahogany) including its parts and derivatives, which occurs in Mexico and Central America; and</textblock>
    <textblock>Swietenia mahagoni</textblock>
    <textblock>(Caribbean mahogany) including only its logs, sawn wood, and veneer, which occurs on some Caribbean islands and extends to southern Florida. The unlisted species,</textblock>
    <textblock>Swietenia macrophylla</textblock>
    <textblock>(bigleaf mahogany), occurs from South America to Mexico; it apparently forms hybrids naturally with</textblock>
    <textblock>S. humilis</textblock>
    <textblock>in Costa Rica. In the Carribean,</textblock>
    <textblock>S. mahagoni</textblock>
    <textblock>seems to have crossed spontaneously with introduced</textblock>
    <textblock>S. macrophylla</textblock>
    <textblock>to form hybrids that have been called</textblock>
    <textblock>S. aubrevilleana. Swietenia</textblock>
    <textblock>species and hybrids also are in cultivation (and may be locally naturalized); some are grown ornamentally and/or silviculturally.</textblock>
    <textblock>Swietenia macrophylla</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>S. mahagoni</textblock>
    <textblock>are grown with limited success in plantations in the tropics of the New and Old Worlds.</textblock>
    <textblock>At COP8, Costa Rica and the United States proposed to include</textblock>
    <textblock>Swietenia macrophylla</textblock>
    <textblock>and its natural hybrid in Appendix II; the U.S. proposal excluded the Old World populations and secondary and final products (e.g., finished products and derivatives). In a preliminary meeting during COP8, all the range States except three (Bolivia, Peru and Honduras) tentatively supported the listing. Costa Rica decided to support the U.S. proposal. However, because of lack of sufficient consensus, the United States withdrew its proposal (cf. 57 FR 20443, May 13, 1992).</textblock>
    <textblock>In response to the July 15, 1993, notice (58 FR 38112) that initiated listing preparations for COP9, the Natural Resources Defense Council provided a new extensive draft proposal to include the neotropical populations of</textblock>
    <textblock>Swietenia macrophylla</textblock>
    <textblock>and its natural hybrid in Appendix II, including only the timber and wood processed to the first stage of transformation (i.e., primary products), such as logs, wood in the rough, sawn wood, veneer sheets, and plywood. The September 1993 meeting of the CITES Plants Committee favored submission of a proposal for this species.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Service regards the available information and data sufficient to support reproposing this species and its natural hybrid, and believes that there is increasing understanding of the consequences and value of its regulation under CITES Appendix II. The United States has become the main importer of this species, and the Service plans to provide a draft proposal to the range States for their comments. Information is desired particularly on populations that are functioning naturally and are effectively safe from habitat loss and exploitation.</textblock>
    <textblock>14. African Mahoganies</textblock>
    <textblock>The Fauna and Flora Preservation Society provided draft proposals to list the African mahoganies in Appendix II. African mahoganies include the genera</textblock>
    <textblock>Entandrophragma</textblock>
    <textblock>(about 11 species) and</textblock>
    <textblock>Khaya</textblock>
    <textblock>(about 6 species), which are native to the tropics of Africa, with</textblock>
    <textblock>Khaya</textblock>
    <textblock>extending to the Comoros Islands and Madagascar. Some of the 17 species are in cultivation, including some silvicultural plantations. The majority of the species have some legal protection in one or more countries, generally with respect to their export. All of the species have been declining due to habitat conversion and selectively varied commercial exploitation, and nearly all of them have been reported to be threatened in various countries and significant portions of their ranges.</textblock>
    <textblock>The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization has recognized the need to conserve most</textblock>
    <textblock>Khaya</textblock>
    <textblock>and some</textblock>
    <textblock>Entandrophragma</textblock>
    <textblock>species, being concerned with their genetic erosion. The September 1993 meeting of the CITES Plants Committee reviewed draft proposals for these genera, and favored the circulation of these drafts for their possible submission. In November 1993, Germany circulated them to the range States for their views. The Service may join with Germany's initiative, or provide draft proposals to the range States by April 1994 for their comments. Information is desired particularly on populations of each species that are functioning naturally and are effectively safe from habitat loss and exploitation.</textblock>
