    <textblock>Accordingly, OCC is amending its By-Laws by adding definitions of ``associated market-maker''</textblock>
    <textblock>and ``proprietary market-maker''</textblock>
    <textblock>and by including language to prohibit associated market-makers and proprietary market-makers from participating in the combined market-makers' account.</textblock>
    <textblock>An associated market-maker so excluded can maintain its positions in a separate market-maker's account.</textblock>
    <textblock>Because each separate market-maker's account is restricted to the transactions of a single market-maker, the positions of an associated market-maker that are maintained in such an account will not be commingled with the positions of other market-makers or with the positions of the clearing firm.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under OCC rules, a clearing member that maintains a separate market-maker's account for its proprietary market-maker positions (``proprietary market-maker account'') may elect to have the positions in that account combined with the positions in its firm account for purposes of margin calculations</textblock>
    <textblock>as a clearing member may elect to have its associated market-makers' positions treated as proprietary positions so that the associated market-makers' positions are combined with firm positions for purposes of margin calculation.</textblock>

  <footnote>
    <textblock>Under the proposal, Article I, Section 1.P(5) of OCC By-Laws defines proprietary market-maker as a market-maker, specialist, stock market-maker, stock specialist, or registered trader that is (A) a non-customer of the carrying clearing member or (B) a related person of the clearing member that (1) is not a customer of the clearing member for purposes of Commission Rule 15c3-3 [17 CFR 240.15c3-3], (2) does not carry the accounts of persons who are customers for purposes of Commission Rule 15c3-3, and (3) has consented to be treated as a proprietary market-maker. Thus, a proprietary market-maker account can be maintained by not only the clearing member itself but also by any non-customer of the clearing member.

    <textblock>It is generally advantageous to a clearing member to maintain positions in a combined market-makers' account rather than in a separate market-maker's account. Market-makers' positions in the combined market makers' account can be used as offsets or hedges against each other which may result in a lower margin requirement for the clearing member.</textblock>
