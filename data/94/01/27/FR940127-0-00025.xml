  <footnote>
    <textblock>The types of loans that qualify as loans secured by multifamily residential properties are listed in the instructions for preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income. In addition, as provided in those instructions, a multifamily residential property loan that is sold subject to a pro rata loss sharing arrangement is treated by the selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) to the extent that the sales agreement provides for the purchaser of the loan to share in any loss incurred on the loan on a pro rata basis with the selling bank. In such a transaction, from the standpoint of the selling bank, the portion of the loan that is treated as sold is not subject to the risk-based capital standards. In connection with sales of multifamily residential property loans in which the purchaser of a loan shares in any loss incurred on the loan with the selling institution on other than a pro rata basis, these other loss sharing arrangements are taken into account for purposes of determining the extent to which such loans are treated by the selling bank as sold (and excluded from balance sheet assets) under the risk-based capital framework in the same manner as prescribed for reporting purposes in the instructions for preparation of the Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income.</textblock>

    <textblock>At the origination of a loan to purchase an existing property, the term ``value'' means the lesser of the actual acquisition cost or the estimate of value set forth in an appraisal or evaluation, whichever may be appropriate.</textblock>

    <textblock>In the case where the existing owner of a multifamily residential property refinances a loan on that property, all principal and interest payments on the loan being refinanced must have been made on a timely basis in accordance with the terms of that loan for at least the preceding year. The new loan must meet all of the other eligibility criteria in order to qualify for a 50 percent risk weight.</textblock>

    <textblock>Privately-issued mortgage-backed securities that do not meet these criteria or that do not qualify for a lower risk weight generally are assigned to the 100 percent risk weight category.</textblock>
