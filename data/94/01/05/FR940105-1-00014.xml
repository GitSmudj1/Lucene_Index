    <textblock>Compliance: Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.</textblock>
    <textblock>To prevent fatigue failure of the spider, that could result in failure of the main transmission and subsequent loss of control of the helicopter, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) For spiders with 2,400 hours' or more time-in-service (TIS) on the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD), within the next 100 hours' TIS remove and replace the spider with an airworthy spider in accordance with the Accomplishment Instructions of Bell Helicopter Textron, Inc.

    <textblock>(b) For spiders with less than 2,400 hours' TIS on the effective date of this AD, prior to or upon attaining 2,500 hours' TIS, remove and replace the spider with an airworthy spider in accordance with the accomplishment instructions of the appropriate ASB referred to in paragraph (a).</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) This AD revises the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the applicable helicopter maintenance manuals by establishing a retirement life of 2,500 hours' TIS for the spider.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time, which provides an acceptable level of safety, may be used when approved by the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office, FAA, Rotorcraft Directorate. Operators should submit their requests through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may concur or comment and then send it to the Manager, Rotorcraft Certification Office.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note:</textblock>
