L. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057) and the Balance of Payments Program by providing a preference for domestic end products over foreign end products, except for certain foreign end products which meet the requirements for classification as designated, NAFTA, or Caribbean Basin country end products.</textblock>

    <textblock>as used in this clause, means Canada or Mexico.</textblock>
    <textblock>NAFTA country end product,</textblock>
    <textblock>as used in this clause, means an article that (1) is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a NAFTA country, or (2) in the case of an article which consists in whole or in part of materials from another country or instrumentality, has been substantially transformed in a NAFTA country into a new and different article of commerce with a name, character, or use distinct from that of the article or articles from which it was transformed. The term includes services (except transportation services) incidental to its supply;</textblock>
    <textblock>provided,</textblock>
    <textblock>that the value of those incidental services does not exceed that of the product itself. It does not include service contracts as such.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) The Contracting Officer has determined that the Trade Agreements Act and NAFTA apply to this acquisition. Unless otherwise specified, the Acts apply to all items in the schedule. The Contractor agrees to deliver under this contract only domestic end products unless, in its offer, it specifies delivery of foreign end products in the provision entitled ``Buy American Act_Trade Agreements_Balance of Payments Program Certificate.'' An offer certifying that a designated, NAFTA, or Caribbean Basin country end product will be supplied requires the Contractor to supply a designated, NAFTA, or Caribbean Basin country end product or, at the Contractor's option, a domestic end product. Contractors may not supply a foreign end product for line items subject to the Trade Agreements Act unless the foreign end product is a designated, NAFTA, or Caribbean end product (see FAR 25.401), or unless a waiver is granted under section 302 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (see FAR 25.402(c)).</textblock>
