    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Chapter Ten of NAFTA requires the three NAFTA countries (the United States, Canada, and Mexico) to eliminate ``buy national'' restrictions on non-defense related purchases, by their responsible Federal Governments, of goods and services provided by firms in North America. NAFTA applies to most United States Government agencies. The Canadian Free Trade Agreement is suspended while NAFTA remains in effect.</textblock>
    <textblock>As required by NAFTA, specified agencies must evaluate certain NAFTA country end products offers without regard to the restrictions of the Buy American Act or the Balance of Payments Program. This evaluation method will apply to offers of Canadian end products under supply contracts with an estimated value above $25,000 and Mexican end products under supply contracts with an estimated value of $50,000 or more, except for the Department of Energy's Power Marketing Administrations, where the estimated acquisition value is $250,000 or more. This evaluation method also will apply to construction contracts with an estimated acquisition value of $6,500,000 or more, except for the Department of Energy's Power Marketing Administration, where the estimated acquisition value is $8,000,000 or more.</textblock>
    <textblock>The applicable rule of origin for NAFTA country end products under the agreement is that of ``substantial transformation'', which means an article that is wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a NAFTA country or has been substantially transformed in a NAFTA country into a new and different article may be offered.</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule also_</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Designates NAFTA country end products as eligible products under the Trade Agreements Act, as implemented in Trade Agreements under the FAR;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Adds language to require that, when an overseas procurement for performance overseas is subject to NAFTA, it will be synopsized in accordance with agency procedures;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Revises the prescriptions for the provisions, Submission of Offers in the English Language, and Submission of Offers in U.S. Currency, to clarify and include NAFTA;</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Updates the list of designated countries in FAR 25.401 to add ``Portugal'' and revise ``Upper Volta'' to ``Burkina Faso'';</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Includes the new threshold of $182,000 for application of the Trade Agreements Act and the European Community (EC) Agreement, which is effective January 1, 1994;</textblock>
    <textblock>(6) Updates FAR 25.407 list of agencies covered by the Agreements on EC and NAFTA; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(7) Makes clarifications to the interim rule published in FAC 90-18 (58 FR 31140), at FAR 25.407, to implement the Memorandum of Understanding between the United States of America and the European Economic Community on Government Procurement and NAFTA.</textblock>
