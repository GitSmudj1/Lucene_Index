    <textblock>Because raw poultry furnish a rich medium for the potential growth of both beneficial and harmful microorganisms, it has been assumed traditionally that a certain level of microbial activity on the surface tissues of raw poultry was unavoidable. Consequently, poultry slaughter inspection activities have focused on the organoleptic detection of poultry diseases or other abnormalities in carcasses and parts that would render the products adulterated or unwholesome.</textblock>
    <textblock>Over the years, scientific and public concern about microbiological contamination of poultry products has expanded from the processing of such products to conditions under which poultry are slaughtered, and even to preslaughter poultry production. FSIS has encouraged the scientific community and the regulated industry to develop slaughtering and processing methods and treatments that would yield raw poultry products that are as free as practicable of pathogenic bacteria. The control of miscrooganisms on raw poultry has been given a high priority on FSIS's research agenda.</textblock>
    <textblock>Researchers estimate that from 6.5 million to 33 million Americans, or 3 to 14 percent of the population, become ill each year from consumption of foods containing microorganisms. An estimated 9,000 of these illnesses result in death, or 4 in 100,000 people. Chapter 4 of a 1985 report by the National Research Council/National Academy of Sciences, Meat and Poultry Inspection: The Scientific Basis of the Nation's Program, recommended, in part, that the poultry inspection program be refocused to place greater emphasis on microbiological and chemical testing.</textblock>
    <textblock>Since the issuance of that report, FSIS has given greater priority to microbiological and chemical testing.</textblock>
    <textblock>Among the diseases caused by foodborne microorganisms, the one receiving the most publicity in recent years has been salmonellosis. This common human intestinal disorder was estimated to cost Americans approximately $1 billion in 1987.</textblock>
    <textblock>Much of the concern about</textblock>
    <textblock>Salmonella</textblock>
    <textblock>in the food supply has focused on chicken. FSIS has encouraged and permitted the industry to use technologies such as counterflow scalders, chlorinated inplant water, and ionizing radiation to reduce</textblock>
    <textblock>Salmonella</textblock>
    <textblock>and other pathogenic bacteria.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., Petition</textblock>
    <textblock>FSIS has been petitioned by Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., Cranbury, New Jersey, to permit the use of food-grade TSP as a processing aid in post-chill poultry slaughter operations.</textblock>
    <textblock>The petitioner requested the use of a treatment solution consisting of TSP dissolved in water to a concentration of 10 percent, plus or minus 2 percent (8 to 12 percent). The petitioner requested exposure of the poultry to the TSP treatment solution for no more than 15 seconds, with the TSP treatment solution being maintained at 50</textblock>
    <textblock>○ F., plus or minus 5</textblock>
    <textblock>○ F. (45</textblock>
    <textblock>○ F. to 55</textblock>
    <textblock>○ F.).</textblock>
    <textblock>The petitioner supplied data demonstrating that the use of TSP, under the parameters addressed above, is effective in reducing the levels of bacteria, including pathogenic bacteria, found on raw, chilled poultry carcasses. Immediately after chilling, poultry carcasses that have been passed for wholesomeness enter the TSP treatment system. Chilled poultry carcasses are either sprayed with or dipped in the TSP treatment solution for no more than 15 seconds. The concentration of TSP used in various studies conducted by or for the petitioner ranged from 8 to 12 percent in water, at temperatures ranging from 45</textblock>
    <textblock>○ F. to 55</textblock>
    <textblock>○ F.</textblock>
    <textblock>Data from the petitioner included results of studies conducted by the Pennsylvania State Sensory Laboratory for Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., on consumer acceptability of cooked poultry derived from TSP-treated poultry carcasses. These studies show no significant difference in taste or appearance between cooked poultry from TSP-treated poultry carcasses and cooked poultry from untreated poultry.</textblock>
    <textblock>The petitioner also provided study results concerning moisture pickup and residue findings in poultry carcasses treated with TSP. According to these study results, the moisture pickup in TSP-treated poultry carcasses does not exceed regulatory limits for moisture absorption as prescribed in 9 CFR 381.66(d)(5). Residue findings ranged from ^0.25 percent to 0.11 percent, showing that virtually no residue of the TSP solution remains on or in the treated poultry carcasses.</textblock>
