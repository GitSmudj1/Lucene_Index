    <textblock>On October 18, 1993, a Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was issued for violations identified during an NRC inspection on July 14-16, 1993. Physicians' Laboratory Service, Inc. responded to the Notice on November 17, 1993. The Licensee admitted the violations that resulted in the proposed civil penalty, but requested that the NRC reconsider the circumstances surrounding the violations and mitigate the proposed civil penalty. A restatement of the violation, and the NRC's evaluation and conclusions regarding the Licensee's request follow:</textblock>
    <textblock>Restatement of Violations Assessed a Civil Penalty</textblock>
    <textblock>10 CFR 35.32 (a) and (e), require, in part, that by January 27, 1992, each licensee establish and maintain a written quality management program to provide high confidence that byproduct material or radiation from byproduct material will be administered as directed by the authorized user. The quality management program must include written policies and procedures to meet specific objectives, including that prior to administration, a written directive is prepared for any administration of quantities greater than 30 microcuries of sodium iodide I-125 or I-131.</textblock>
    <textblock>10 CFR 35.2, ``Definitions,'' defines a written directive, in part, as an order in writing for a specific patient, dated and signed by an authorized user prior to administration of a radiopharmaceutical and specifies, in part, that for the administration of quantities greater than 30 microcuries of either sodium iodide I-125 or I-131 or any therapeutic administration of a radiopharmaceutical other than sodium iodide I-125 or I-131, the written directive must include the dosage.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Contrary to the above, between January 27, 1992, and July 27, 1992, the licensee did not establish a written quality management program (01013).</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Contrary to the above, on numerous occasions after January 27, 1992, including March 8 and 22, May 13, June 3, and July 1, 1993, the licensee administered sodium iodide I-131 for diagnostic purposes in quantities greater than 30 microcuries without a written directive signed by an authorized user (01023).</textblock>
    <textblock>These violations represent a Severity Level III problem (Supplement VI).</textblock>
