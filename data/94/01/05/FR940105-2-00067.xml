    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 10, 1993, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by the Pencil Makers Association, Inc., Marlton, NJ, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of LTFV imports of certain cased pencils from the People's Republic of China and Thailand. Accordingly, effective November 10, 1993, the Commission instituted antidumping investigations Nos. 731-TA-669-670 (Preliminary).</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigations and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of November 17, 1993 (58 FR 60670). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on December 1, 1993, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission transmitted its determinations in these investigations to the Secretary of Commerce on December 27, 1993. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2713 (December 1993), entitled ``Certain Cased Pencils from the People's Republic of China and Thailand: Investigations Nos. 731-TA-669-670 (Preliminary).''</textblock>
