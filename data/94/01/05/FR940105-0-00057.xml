    <textblock>II. Submission of Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>By letter dated October 6, 1993 (Administrative Record No. AAML-18), Arkansas submitted a proposed amendment to its plan pursuant to SMCRA. Arkansas submitted the proposed amendment in response to a required program amendment at 30 CFR 904.26(a) that was placed on the Arkansas plan when OSM approved Arkansas' March 31, 1993, plan amendment (58 FR 38532, July 19, 1993; Administrative Record No. AAML-17). Arkansas intended that this amendment be in compliance with section 402 of SMCRA.</textblock>
    <textblock>Arkansas proposed to amend Arkansas Code Annotated (ACA) 15-58-401(b)(2) that provides criteria for the determination of the eligibility of certain project sites for AML funding. Specifically, Arkansas proposed to require at ACA 15-58-401(b)(2) a finding that the surface coal mining operation occurred during the period beginning on August 4, 1977, and ending on November 5, 1990.</textblock>
    <textblock>OSM announced receipt of the proposed amendment in the November 1, 1993,</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(58 FR 58313; Administrative Record No. AAML-25) and in the same notice opened the public comment period and provided an opportunity for a public hearing on the substantive adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period closed on December 1, 1993. No substantive comments were received. The public hearing, scheduled for November 26, 1993, was not held because no one requested an opportunity to testify.</textblock>
