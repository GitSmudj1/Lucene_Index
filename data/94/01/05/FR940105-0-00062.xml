  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This action vacates the rule provisions that established private entity club call sign administrators and reinstates prior rules. A new proposal regarding call signs will meet the need for persons interested in obtaining a club station license. Hence, it is not necessary to retain the club call sign administrator rules adopted in an earlier action.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>This is a summary of the Commission's Memorandum Opinion and Order, adopted December 13, 1993, and released December 29, 1993. The complete text of this Commission action, including the rule amendments, is available for inspection and copying during normal business hours in the FCC Reference Center (room 230), 1919 M Street, NW., Washington, DC. The complete text of this Memorandum Opinion and Order, including the rule amendments, may also be purchased from the Commission's copy contractor, International Transcription Services, Inc., (ITS, Inc.), 2100 M Street, NW., suite 140, Washington, DC 20037.</textblock>
    <textblock>Summary of Memorandum Opinion and Order</textblock>
    <textblock>1. On May 11, 1993, final rules were adopted that established call sign administrators for club and military recreation stations in the amateur service. Subsequently, a petition for reconsideration was filed in which it was argued that the establishment of such administrators was not minor and non-controversial and that a notice and comment proceeding should have been held before final rules were adopted.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Further, the Commission is activating a new automated licensing system that will enable it to perform, with minimal burden, the function that administrators in the private sector were going to perform without reimbursement. Also, a new proposal by the Commission regarding call signs will meet the need of persons interested in obtaining a club station license.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Because there appears to be merit in the argument that the establishment of administrators is controversial, and because the new proposal will meet the need of persons interested in the club station licenses, the rule provisions that established private entity club call sign administrators can be vacated.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Accordingly, by this action, the rules establishing administrators are vacated, the prior rules are reinstated, and the petition for reconsideration is granted.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. The amended rules are set forth at the end of this document.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. The amended rules have been analyzed with respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501-3520, and found to contain no new or modified form, information collection and/or record retention requirements, and will not increase or decrease burden hours imposed on the public.</textblock>
    <textblock>7. This Memorandum Opinion and Order and the rule amendments are issued under the authority of 47 U.S.C. 154(i), 303(r), and 405(a).</textblock>
