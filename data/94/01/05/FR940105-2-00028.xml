    <textblock>December 29, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>Take notice that on December 20, 1993, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (TGPL), P.O. Box 1396, Houston, Texas 77251, filed in Docket No. CP94-149-000 an application pursuant to section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act for permission and approval to abandon a 652 horsepower compressor unit and appurtenant facilities in Nueces County, Texas, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.</textblock>
    <textblock>TGPL proposes to abandon by sale the compressor, which is located at the interconnection between TGPL's Petronilla Lateral and the pipeline system of Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) in Nueces County. It is stated that the compressor was installed under Commission authorization in Docket No. CP80-533-000 by order issued March 23, 1981. It is asserted that the compressor was installed to alleviate capacity constraints on TGPL's Petronilla Lateral so that TGPL could take delivery of up to 30,000 Mcf of gas per day which was imported from Mexico at an existing delivery point with Texas Eastern. It is explained that TGPL was purchasing gas from Border Gas, Inc. for system supply purposes, but that TGPL has not purchased gas under the gas purchase contract since December 1984 and does not plan to resume such purchases. It is stated that the proposed abandonment would have no impact on the daily design capacity or operating conditions on TGPL's system. It is further stated that no customers would lose service as a result of the proposed abandonment.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before January 7, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, D.C. 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.</textblock>
    <textblock>Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for TGPL to appear or be represented at the hearing.</textblock>
