    <textblock>I</textblock>
    <textblock>Physicians' Laboratory Service, Inc. (Licensee or PLS) was the holder of NRC License No. 25-21258-01 (License) issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or Commission). The License, which was transferred to Bozeman Deaconess Hospital on July 2, 1993, authorized the Licensee to possess and use byproduct material to conduct nuclear medicine activities in accordance with the conditions of the License.</textblock>
    <textblock>II</textblock>
    <textblock>An inspection of the Licensee's activities was conducted July 14-16, 1993. The results of this inspection indicated that the Licensee had not conducted its activities in full compliance with NRC requirements. A written Notice of Violation and Proposed Imposition of Civil Penalty (Notice) was served upon the Licensee by letter dated October 18, 1993. The Notice described the circumstances surrounding the violations, the provisions of the NRC's requirements that the Licensee had violated, and the amount of the civil penalty proposed for the violations.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Licensee responded to the Notice in a letter dated November 17, 1993. In its letter, the Licensee admitted the violations which resulted in the proposed civil penalty, but requested that the NRC reconsider the circumstances surrounding the violations and mitigate the proposed civil penalty for reasons that are summarized in the Appendix to this order.</textblock>
    <textblock>III</textblock>
    <textblock>After consideration of the Licensee's response and the statements of fact, explanation, and argument for mitigation contained therein, the NRC staff has determined, as set forth in the Appendix to this Order, that the violations occurred as stated and that the penalty proposed for the violations designated in the Notice should be imposed.</textblock>
    <textblock>IV</textblock>
    <textblock>In view of the foregoing and pursuant to section 234 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (Act), 42 U.S.C. 2282, and 10 CFR 2.205,</textblock>
    <textblock>It is hereby ordered That:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Licensee pay the civil penalty in the amount of $2,500 within 30 days of the date of this Order, by check, draft, money order, or electronic transfer, payable to the Treasurer of the United States and mailed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555.</textblock>
    <textblock>V</textblock>
    <textblock>The Licensee may request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order. A request for a hearing should be clearly marked as a ``Request for an Enforcement Hearing,'' and shall be addressed to the Director, Office of Enforcement, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, ATTN: Document Control Desk, Washington, DC 20555. Copies also shall be sent to the Assistant General Counsel for Hearings and Enforcement at the same address and to the Regional Administrator, NRC Region IV, 611 Ryan Plaza Drive, Suite 400, Arlington, Texas 76011.</textblock>
    <textblock>If a hearing is requested, the Commission will issue an Order designating the time and place of the hearing. If the Licensee fails to request a hearing within 30 days of the date of this Order, the provisions of this Order shall be effective without further proceedings. If payment has not been made by that time, the matter may be referred to the Attorney General for collection.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the event the Licensee requests a hearing as provided above, the issue to be considered at such hearing shall be:</textblock>
    <textblock>Whether, on the basis of the violations admitted by the Licensee, this Order should be sustained.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 22nd day of December 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</textblock>
