    <textblock>Concurring Statement of Commissioner Roscoe B. Starek, III</textblock>
    <textblock>I concur in the Commission's decision to accept for public comment the Consent Order in this matter. The evidence demonstrates that ten companies, representing more than 90% of U.S. sales of protective body armor, engaged in unreasonable restraints of trade in violation of section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 U.S.C. 45. The agreements here restrain significant dimensions of competitive rivalry among body armor manufacturers. Therefore, they appear likely, absent an efficiency justification, to restrict output. The respondent has not proffered any efficiency justification for the restraints. Under the standards set forth in the Commission's decision in Massachusetts Board of Registration in Optometry,</textblock>
    <textblock>and its progeny, this ``inherently suspect'' conduct is appropriately condemned without a full rule of reason analysis.</textblock>
    <textblock>In my view, however, it may have been appropriate to name as respondents the members of the Personal Protective Armor Association (``PPAA''). This case is not typical of the Commission's cases challenging anticompetitive conduct of state licensing boards and trade associations. In most such cases, the board or association represents hundreds or thousands of competing entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>Naming individual members as respondents in such cases is generally impracticable: It may unnecessarily complicate litigation or create intractable problems for settlement negotiations.</textblock>
    <textblock>More importantly, naming members is often unnecessary: The respondent board or association is typically the only (or only effective) means by which the multitude of competitors can reach and enforce an agreement restraining competition.</textblock>
    <textblock>By contrast, competitors in the relatively concentrated protective body armor industry may be able to collude effectively outside the auspices of the PPAA or any other formal trade association.</textblock>
    <textblock>If so, the proposed Consent Order, which names only the PPAA as a respondent, may provide an insufficient remedy. So long as the PPAA is not involved,</textblock>
    <textblock>the same body armor manufacturers could engage in collusive conduct falling squarely within the core cease and desist provisions of the Order without exposure to civil penalties under section 5(l) of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. 45(l).</textblock>
    <textblock>In determining the optimal scope of any future enforcement actions against anticompetitive restraints facilitated by a trade association, the necessity of the particular association to effective collusion among its members should be considered carefully.</textblock>

    <textblock>Thus, unlike many cases involving association restraints in which the respondent association itself is a critical first mover, the conduct at issue here constitutes archetypal cartel behavior in which this particular association's involvement may be merely detail.</textblock>

  <footnote>
    <textblock>Under the Order, respondent PPAA is defined to include any association that can be held to be a legal successor. The evidence does not clearly indicate whether or not PPAA has any structural, legal, or historical advantage that would impede the creation of a new, non-successor body armor trade association.</textblock>

    <textblock>Of course, this conduct would expose these firms to private and state actions for damages under section 4 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. 15. Such exposure, however, apparently did not deter the conduct that led to the Commission's action in this matter.</textblock>
