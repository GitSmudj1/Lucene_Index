    <textblock>17. The applicant explains that the Contribution Obligation will be in effect when the Stock is sold in the future. According to the applicant, if the Stock is sold at a loss, any transaction costs would be accounted for by the Contribution Obligation which would require Tenneco to contribute an amount equal to the number of shares sold, multiplied by the difference between the realized net price and the Lowest Price (see paragraph 5 in the Notice of Proposed Exemption). If the Stock is sold at a gain, the GEBT would bear the transaction costs. The applicant represents that it is customary for pension plans to bear such transaction costs in similar circumstances.</textblock>
    <textblock>Only one of the interested persons who commented on the proposed exemption requested a public hearing, although several others indicated that they wished to be notified if a hearing was scheduled. The Department has considered the concerns expressed by the commentators and the applicant's written responses addressing such concerns, and, on the basis of the materials provided, has determined not to hold a public hearing. Furthermore, after giving full consideration to the entire record, including the written comments and the responses thereto, the Department has decided to grant the exemption.</textblock>
    <textblock>Finally, the applicant has informed the Department that it intends to enter into the transaction on December 29, 1993, and requests that the exemption be made effective as of that date. The Department concurs with this suggested modification.</textblock>
    <textblock>For a more complete statement of the facts and representations supporting the Department's decision to grant this exemption refer to the Notice of Proposed Exemption published on November 15, 1993, at 58 FR 60217.</textblock>
