    <textblock>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</textblock>
    <textblock>Edward Easton or Steve Alley, Office of Antidumping Investigations, Import Administration, International Trade Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone: (202) 482-1777 or (202) 482-5288, respectively.</textblock>
    <textblock>Postponement of Final Determination</textblock>
    <textblock>Hainan Feitian Electrontech Co., Ltd. (Hainan), Shaanxi Minmetals (Shaanxi), Xiamen Abrasive Co. (Xiamen), 7th Grinding Wheel Factory Import and Export Corp., Qinghai Metals and Minerals Import &amp; Export Corp., and The Import and Export Corporation of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, responding exporters in this proceeding, account for a significant proportion of exports of merchandise covered by this investigation. On December 1 and 3, 1993, these exporters requested that the Department of Commerce (the ``Department'') postpone its final determination until not later than 135 days after the date of publication of the preliminary determination.</textblock>
    <textblock>Our November 29, 1993, preliminary determination (58 FR 64549, December 8, 1993) in this proceeding was affirmative. In accordance with section 735(a)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act) and 19 CFR 353.20(b), when, subsequent to an affirmative preliminary determination, we receive a request for postponement of the final determination from exporters who account for a significant proportion of the merchandise under investigation, we are required, absent compelling reasons for denial, to grant the request. Accordingly, we are postponing our final determination as to whether sales of silicon carbide from the PRC have been made at less than fair value until not later than April 22, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Amended Preliminary Determination</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 2, 1993, we disclosed our calculations for the preliminary determination to counsel for Hainan, Shaanxi, and Xiamen. On December 7, 1993, we received timely submissions from each of these three exporters alleging ministerial errors in the Department's preliminary determination calculations. (For specific details of these allegations and our analysis of them, see Memorandum from Richard W. Moreland to Barbara R. Stafford of December 20, 1993).</textblock>
    <textblock>One of these exporters, Hainan, alleged that the Department made certain errors with respect to the valuation of freight rates and packing materials. We agree, and in accordance with procedures set forth in the proposed regulations, we are amending Hainan's preliminary dumping margin because the corrections represent a change of more than five absolute percentage points and more than 25 percent of the dumping margin calculated in the original (erroneous) preliminary determination. See ยง353.15(g)(4)(ii) of the Department's proposed regulations, 57 FR 1131 (January 10, 1992). The corrected dumping margin for Hainan is 50.42 percent.</textblock>
    <textblock>The rest of the alleged ministerial errors were either not ministerial in nature or could not be considered a ``significant ministerial error.'' See ยง353.15(g)(4) of the Department's proposed regulations.</textblock>
    <textblock>Public Comment</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38, case briefs or other written comments in at least ten copies must now be submitted to the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration no later than March 30, 1994, and rebuttal briefs, no later than April 4, 1994. In accordance with 19 CFR 353.38(b), we will hold a public hearing, if requested, to afford interested parties an opportunity to comment on arguments raised in case or rebuttal briefs. Tentatively, the hearing will now be held on April 6, 1994, at 10 a.m. at the U.S. Department of Commerce, room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Parties should confirm by telephone the time, date, and place of the hearing 48 hours before the scheduled time.</textblock>
    <textblock>This notice is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act, 19 CFR 353.20(b)(2) and in accordance with procedures set forth in the Department's proposed regulations, ยง353.15(g)(3), 57 FR 1131 (January 10, 1992).</textblock>
