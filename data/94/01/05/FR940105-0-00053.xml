    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>On August 23, 1978, ATF published Treasury Decision</textblock>
    <textblock>ATF-53 (43 FR 37672, 54624) revising regulations in</textblock>
    <textblock>27 CFR part 4. These regulations allow the establishment</textblock>
    <textblock>of definite American viticultural areas. The regulations</textblock>
    <textblock>also allow the name of an approved viticultural area to be</textblock>
    <textblock>used as an appellation of origin in the labeling and</textblock>
    <textblock>advertising of wine.</textblock>
    <textblock>On October 2, 1979, ATF published Treasury Decision</textblock>
    <textblock>ATF-60 (44 FR 56692) which added a new part 9 to 27 CFR,</textblock>
    <textblock>providing for the listing of American viticultural areas.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 4.25a(e)(l), title 27, CFR, defines an American</textblock>
    <textblock>viticultural area as a delimited grape-growing region</textblock>
    <textblock>distinguishable by geographical features, the boundaries of</textblock>
    <textblock>which have been delineated in subpart C of part 9. Section</textblock>
    <textblock>4.25a(e)(2) outlines the procedure for proposing an</textblock>
    <textblock>American viticultural area. Any interested person may</textblock>
    <textblock>petition ATF to establish a grape-growing region as a</textblock>
    <textblock>viticultural area. The petition should include:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Evidence that the name of the proposed viticultural</textblock>
    <textblock>area is locally and/or nationally known as referring to the</textblock>
    <textblock>area specified in the petition;</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Historical or current evidence that the boundaries of</textblock>
    <textblock>the viticultural area are as specified in the petition;</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Evidence relating to the geographical characteristics</textblock>
    <textblock>(climate, soil, elevation, physical features, etc.) which</textblock>
    <textblock>distinguish the viticultural features of the proposed area</textblock>
    <textblock>from surrounding areas;</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) A description of the specific boundaries of the</textblock>
    <textblock>viticultural area, based on features which can be found on</textblock>
    <textblock>United States Geological Survey (U.S.G.S.) maps of the</textblock>
    <textblock>largest applicable scale; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(e) A copy of the appropriate U.S.G.S. map(s) with the</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed boundaries prominently marked.</textblock>
    <textblock>Petition</textblock>
    <textblock>ATF received a petition from Mr. Charles W. Dean,</textblock>
    <textblock>Viticultural Area Consultant, on behalf of Robert P.</textblock>
    <textblock>Wollersheim and JoAnn I. Wollersheim, proprietors and</textblock>
    <textblock>landowners of Wollersheim Winery near Prairie-du-Sac,</textblock>
    <textblock>Wisconsin, to establish a viticultural area in</textblock>
    <textblock>south-central Wisconsin to be known as ``Lake Wisconsin.''</textblock>
    <textblock>The viticultural area is bounded by the shoreline of Lake</textblock>
    <textblock>Wisconsin and the Wisconsin River on the north and west.</textblock>
    <textblock>Wollersheim Winery is the sole winery located in the 28,000</textblock>
    <textblock>acre viticultural area and there are currently twenty-three</textblock>
    <textblock>acres planted to wine grapes.</textblock>
