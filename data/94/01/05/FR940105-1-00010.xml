    <textblock>Petitioner:</textblock>
    <textblock>Ms. Debra Russi.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulations Affected:</textblock>
    <textblock>14 CFR 105.</textblock>
    <textblock>Description of Rulechange Sought:</textblock>
    <textblock>To require all parachute training be performed in accordance with the United States Parachute Association (USPA) training program or in accordance with a plan approved by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA); incorporated by reference the USPA training program in part 105; and require that the operator of an aircraft immediately, and by the most expeditions means available, notify the nearest FAA Air Traffic Facility when a sport parachute accident/incident occurs involving a person who made an intentional jump from that aircraft.</textblock>
    <textblock>Petitioner's Reason for the Request:</textblock>
    <textblock>The petitioner feels that this amendment is needed to protect the citizens of the United States of America, who wish to participate in sport parachuting, by providing participants the assurance of a training course which adheres to approved specifications; and, in the event of a parachute accident, the proposed changes would facilitate prompt notification of the nearest FAA field office, enabling timely investigative procedures.</textblock>
