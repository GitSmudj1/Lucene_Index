    <textblock>The Commission is convinced that the development of effective file uploading and subset downloading capability would markedly enhance communication efficiency related to capacity release. Working Group 4 should continue to assign a high priority to developing standards in this area. The Commission recognizes the concerns with uploads submitted close to the end of the bidding period, but is confident the Working Groups can develop the necessary standards to deal with this issue.</textblock>
    <textblock>C. Standardization of Non-Capacity Release Business Transactions</textblock>
    <textblock>The industry established Working Group 3 to consider the development of standards relating to business practices, other than capacity release, resulting from the business changes fostered by pipeline restructuring under Order No. 636. In its report, the Working Group did not propose any standards; it outlined the areas of highest priority and its process for continuing to examine these issues. Several commenters support the continuation of these efforts, maintaining standardization of these business data is critically important to the industry.</textblock>
    <textblock>Vesta contends the Commission should require the pipelines now to provide the 16 data items tentatively established by Working Group 3 as being the most critical. Others oppose the continuation of Working Group 3's deliberations, arguing standards in these areas are not required by Order No. 636 and the Commission should limit its promulgation of standards to those essential for capacity release.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission has recognized the restructuring occasioned by Order No. 636 likely will result in changes to business practices, apart from capacity release, which could require further standardization.</textblock>
    <textblock>Standardizing capacity release information was the first step in this process, but now the Working Groups should turn their attention to standards for these other business transactions.</textblock>
    <textblock>From over 66 items proposed for review, Working Group 3 found 33 to be of high priority, and of those 33, focused its initial review on ten elements.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the Commission's view, standardization of these ten, or most of them, would provide a good departure point for this effort. The Commission realizes all facets of the industry may not have equal need for all these elements, but these elements would appear to have wide enough coverage that the benefits from standardization will be widespread. Moreover, once standards are in place, those who may not now perceive a need for standards, may come to realize the standards will make their business more efficient, and even those who do not need the standards themselves, stand to benefit if other segments of the industry become more efficient.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Working Group should propose an appropriate implementation schedule for the ten identified data elements. The Working Group also should continue its efforts to identify which of the remaining 23 high priority data elements, as well as any others, require standardization and propose a schedule for implementation of standards for these elements as well.</textblock>
    <textblock>D. Policy Issues</textblock>
    <textblock>The minority reports and initial comments raised questions about three policy issues: the method of recovering the costs of standardization, pipeline disclaimers of liability for EBB operation, and the disclosure of non-price considerations underlying capacity release transactions. The Commission stated in the NOPR that such substantive policy issues are beyond the scope of this proceeding and are more appropriately considered in individual proceedings.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Costs of Standardization</textblock>
    <textblock>In the NOPR, the Commission recognized the concern of firm shippers that the costs of compliance with the EBB standards should be spread equitably across all those benefitting from the standards. The Commission encouraged the industry to consider methods for ensuring equitable sharing of such costs, such as user or access fees.</textblock>
    <textblock>Many commenters support development of a fair and equitable method of allocating costs.</textblock>
    <textblock>Transco and Williston Basin maintain EDI, in particular, is not suitable for all customers and suggest the costs of implementing this technology should be borne by those benefitting from it. PSCW contends LDCs should not have to subsidize the costs of providing information benefitting other parties and suggests an incremental pricing system for all information beyond a basic level. A number of commenters are concerned about leaving the issue solely to rate cases.</textblock>
    <textblock>They maintain the policy needs to be consistent across pipelines and urge the Commission to decide on the method for allocating costs in this proceeding or in another generic proceeding, leaving implementation to individual rate cases. Power Generators opposes inclusion of this issue in the Working Groups, because the success of the Groups was due to their focus on technical issues.</textblock>

    <textblock>For example, one possible approach the Working Groups could consider is whether all bids received within some time period prior to the close of the bidding period should be treated as having been received at the same time.</textblock>
