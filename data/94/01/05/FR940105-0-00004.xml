    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations governing fitness-for-duty (FFD) programs that are applicable to licensees who are authorized to construct or operate nuclear power reactors and to licensees authorized to possess, use, or transport formula quantities of strategic special nuclear material (SSNM). The amendment permits licensees to reduce the random testing rate for all persons covered by the fitness-for-duty regulations to an annual rate equal to 50 percent.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The NRC has reviewed experiences gained since publication of the current FFD rule on June 7, 1989 (54 FR 24468), and implementation by power reactor licensees on January 3, 1990, and determined that it may be appropriate to modify the random testing rate. Accordingly, on March 24, 1993 (58 FR 15810), the Commission published a proposed modification to the FFD rule that would permit a reduction in the random testing rate for licensee employees, but maintain the 100-percent random testing rate for contractors and vendors.</textblock>
