    <textblock>§13.34</textblock>
    <textblock>Purpose.</textblock>
    <textblock>This subpart establishes procedures for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to refer past-due debts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for offset against the income tax refunds of persons owing debts to EPA. It specifies the Agency procedures and the rights of the debtor applicable to claims for the payment of debts owed to EPA.</textblock>
    <textblock>§13.35</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability and scope.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) This subpart implements 31 U.S.C. 3720A, which authorizes the IRS to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past-due legally enforceable debt owed to the United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) For purposes of this section, a past-due legally enforceable debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to the United States and:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Except in the case of a judgment debt, has been delinquent for at least three months but has not been delinquent for more than ten years at the time the offset is made;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Is ineligible for administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by reason of 31 U.S.C. 3716(c)(2) or cannot be collected by administrative offset under 31 U.S.C. 3716(a) by the Agency against amounts payable to or on behalf of the debtor by or on behalf of the Agency;</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) With respect to which EPA has given the taxpayer at least 60 days from the date of notification to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable, has considered evidence presented by such taxpayer, if any, and has determined that an amount of such debt is past-due and legally enforceable;</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Has been disclosed by EPA to a consumer reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f), unless a consumer reporting agency would be prohibited from using such information by 15 U.S.C. 1681c, or unless the amount of the debt does not exceed $100.00;</textblock>
    <textblock>(6) With respect to which EPA has notified or has made a reasonable attempt to notify the taxpayer that the debt is past-due and, unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, the debt will be referred to the IRS for offset against any overpayment of tax;</textblock>
    <textblock>(7) Is at least $25.00; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Department of the Treasury regulations at 26 CFR 301.6402-6 relating to the eligibility of a debt for tax return offset have been satisfied.</textblock>
    <textblock>§13.36</textblock>
    <textblock>Administrative charges.</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with §13.11, all administrative charges incurred in connection with the referral of a debt to the IRS shall be assessed on the debt and thus increase the amount of the offset.</textblock>
    <textblock>§13.37</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice requirement before offset.</textblock>
    <textblock>A request for reduction of an IRS tax refund will be made only after EPA makes a determination that an amount is owed and past-due and provides the debtor with 60 days written notice. EPA's notice of intention to collect by IRS tax refund offset (Notice of Intent) will state:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) The amount of the debt;</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) That unless the debt is repaid within 60 days from the date of EPA's Notice of Intent, EPA intends to collect the debt by requesting the IRS to reduce any amounts payable to the debtor as refunds of Federal taxes paid by an amount equal to the amount of the debt and all accumulated interest and other charges;</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) That the debtor has a right to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) A mailing address for forwarding any written correspondence and a contact name and phone number for any questions.</textblock>
