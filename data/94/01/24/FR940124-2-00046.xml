    <textblock>Applicant's Representations</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Security Life is a stock life insurance company organized under the laws of Colorado and is the depositor of the Account. The Account was organized under Colorado law, and is registered under the Act as a unit investment trust. That portion of the assets of the Account that is equal to the reserves and other Contract liabilities with respect to the Account is not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business of Security Life. Any income, gains, or losses, realized or unrealized, from assets allocated to the Account are credited to or charged against the Account without regard to other income, gains, or losses of Security Life. The Account is divided into six divisions, each of which invests exclusively in shares of The Palladian Trust (the ``Trust''). The Trust is registered under the Act as an open-end management investment company.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. SLD Equities, a registered broker-dealer and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Security Life, will be the principal underwriter of the Contracts.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The Contracts provide for retirement payments or other long-term benefits for persons covered under plans that receive favorable federal income tax treatment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and for persons desiring such benefits who do not qualify for such tax advantages. The minimum initial purchase payment is $25,000 for a non-qualified Contract and $1,500 for a qualified Contract. The minimum additional purchase payment is $500 for a non-qualified Contract and $250 for a qualified Contract. Annuity payments under a Contract may be received on a variable basis.</textblock>
