    <textblock>II. Submission of Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>By letter dated January 6, 1993, (Administrative Record No. WY-21-1) Wyoming submitted shrub density rules as a proposed amendment to its permanent program pursuant to SMCRA. The proposed Wyoming amendment revises the Land Quality Division (LQD) Rules at Chapter IV, Section 2(d)(x)(E), shrub density standard, and Appendix A, entitled ``Vegetation Sampling Methods and Reclamation Success Standards for Surface Coal Mining Operations.''</textblock>
    <textblock>OSM published a notice in the March 22, 1993,</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(58 FR 15318) announcing receipt of the amendment and inviting public comment on the adequacy of the proposed amendment. The public comment period ended April 21, 1993. During this public comment period Wyoming submitted additional information regarding shrub density legislation, Enrolled Act No. 86 [Senate File No. 39] on April 13, 1993 (Administrative Record No. WY-21-21). This proposed legislation amended Wyoming Statute (W.S.) 35-11-103(e) by creating new paragraphs (xxxviii) through (xxx), that define agricultural lands, critical habitat, and important or critical habitat; modified the paragraph at W.S. 35-11-402(b), that provides shrub density standards; and created a new subsection (c) at W.S. 35-11-402, that would provide shrub density standards on grazingland.</textblock>
