    <textblock>9. PRBRC opposed OSM's decision to process the Wyoming submittals as program amendments under 30 CFR 732.17. The commenter stated that because these submittals pertain to a condition of program approval, the provisions of 30 CFR 732.13(j) apply instead. The Secretary cannot agree with the commenter. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) specifically require that all changes to laws and regulations that make up the State program be submitted to OSM as a program amendment. Both the August 18, 1982, and the March 9, 1993, submittals fall into this category. Furthermore, the provisions of 30 CFR 732.13(j) apply only if the State has not initiated action to satisfy the condition of program approval, a situation which does not exist here.</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Agency Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to section 503(b) of SMCRA and its implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Wyoming program. None of these agencies provided any objection to approval of the submittals.</textblock>
    <textblock>State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>As required by 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM provided the submittals to the SHPO and ACHP for comment No comments were received.</textblock>
    <textblock>Environmental Protection Agency Concurrence</textblock>
    <textblock>Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), OSM must obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) before approving any provisions of a proposed State program amendment that relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>). On October 25, 1993, the EPA concurred with Wyoming's proposed amendments (Administrative Record No. WY-22-16).</textblock>
    <textblock>V. Secretary's Decision</textblock>
    <textblock>Based on the above findings, the Secretary is approving Wyoming's proposed program amendments as submitted on August 18, 1992, and March 9, 1993, with the exception of W.S. 35-11-437(g) (see finding 7) and those provisions of W.S. 35-11-437(f) set forth in findings 1, 3, 5, and 6. The Secretary also is revising the cost recovery component of the condition of program approval at 30 CFR 950.11(c) to reflect the statutory and regulatory changes made by the proposed amendments consider in this rulemaking. For the reasons discussed in finding 8, the Secretary is removing the intervention component of the condition.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Federal regulations at 30 CFR Part 950 codifying decisions concerning the Wyoming program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal Standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary acknowledges that the plaintiff in</textblock>

    <textblock>Babbitt</textblock>
    <textblock>(``</textblock>

September 29, 1993) (Order granting defendants' motions for summary judgement; notice of appeal filed November 22, 1993), included in its prayer for relief a request that the court compel the Secretary to make any amendments satisfying condition ``c'' retroactive to May 20, 1983, the deadline the Secretary had established for Wyoming to comply with the condition. The Secretary does not find the action requested by the plaintiff to be appropriate in this instance.</textblock>
