    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect cracking in certain fuselage upper deck tension ties, and repair or modification of any cracked tension ties. This proposal is prompted by reports of fatigue cracking in tension ties. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of two or more tension ties and the resultant rapid decompression of the airplane.</textblock>

    <textblock>Discussion</textblock>
    <textblock>Recently, the FAA has received reports of fatigue cracking in the tension ties on several Boeing Model 747 series airplanes. Most of the cracks were found in the aft channel of the tension tie. These cracks usually occurred in the upper flange of the aft channel of the tension tie. Only one crack was found in the forward channel of the tension tie. The cause of this fatigue cracking has been attributed to the tension ties bending under cabin pressurization loads. This condition, if not corrected, could result in rapid decompression of the airplane in the event of failure of two or more tension ties.</textblock>
    <textblock>These reports of fatigue cracks were received in response to the Supplemental Structural Inspection Program, which was required to be implemented by AD 93-06-01, Amendment 39-8526 (58 FR 19571, April 15, 1993). The purpose of that AD is to implement an inspection program that detects the potential for cracking in specific areas of the airplane that are critical for flight safety. Whenever cracks are found in a Structural Significant Item, the FAA takes rulemaking action to correct these findings of an unsafe condition. This proposal is in response to such a finding.</textblock>
    <textblock>On September 4, 1984, the FAA issued AD 84-19-01, amendment 39-4913 (49 FR 36365, September 17, 1984), to require inspections of the tension tie at body station (BS) 760 on a certain group of Model 747 series airplanes, and at BS 780 on certain other Model 747 series airplanes. The inspections proposed by this rulemaking action do not retract the inspection requirements of that AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA has reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 747-53-2371, dated July 29, 1993, that describes procedures for repetitive detailed visual inspections of the outboard ends of certain tension ties, and repair or modification of cracked tension ties. This modification entails trimming the cracked portion of the channel of the tension tie.</textblock>
    <textblock>Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other products of this same type design, the proposed AD would require repetitive detailed visual inspections of the outboard ends of certain tension ties, and repair or modification of cracked tension ties. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletin described previously.</textblock>
