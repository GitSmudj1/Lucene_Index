    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 9 of the Act prohibits the ``Taking'' of any endangered species, including the golden-cheeked warbler. However, the Service, under limited circumstances, may issue permits to take endangered wildlife species if such taking is incidental to, and not the purpose of otherwise lawful activities. Regulations governing permits for endangered species are at 50 CFR 17.22.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Applicant plans to build a residential development on a 213 acre tract on RR2222 at Far West Blvd., west of Austin, Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately 86.84 acres including 10.58 acres of impervious cover (i.e., streets, rooftops and driveways) with the remaining 126.16 acres proposed as conservation areas. These activities will permanently eliminate about 86.84 acres of occupied and/or potential endangered species habitat. The applicant proposed to mitigate the incidental take via dedicating 126.16 acres for open space, and providing sufficient money to purchase land containing six golden-cheeked warbler territories adjacent to, or within, a preserve that is managed for the warbler, and money, or other compensation, to operate and manage those lands for the life of the permit.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Applicant considered five alternatives but rejected four of them because they were not economically viable.</textblock>
