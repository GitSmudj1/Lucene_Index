    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Background on the Indiana Program</textblock>
    <textblock>On July 29, 1982, the Indiana program was made effective by the conditional approval of the Secretary of the Interior. Information pertinent to the general background on the Indiana program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval of the Indiana program can be found in the July 26, 1982,</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(47 FR 32107). Subsequent actions concerning the conditions of approval and program amendments are identified at 30 CFR 914.10, 914,15, and 914.16.</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Discussion of the Proposed Amendments</textblock>
    <textblock>Since July 29, 1982, (the date of conditional approval of the Indiana program), a number of changes have been made to the Federal regulations concerning surface coal mining and reclamation operations. Pursuant to the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17, OSM informed Indiana on May 22, 1985 (Regulatory Reform I), on August 24, 1988 (Regulatory Reform II), and on September 20, 1989 (Regulatory Reform III), that a number of Indiana regulations are less effective than or inconsistent with the revised Federal requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>By letter date December 30, 1993 (Administrative Record No. IND-1322), the Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) submitted to OSM a State program amendment package (number 93-7) consisting of revisions to 38 sections of the Indiana rules. These revisions address changes to the Indiana program that were identified in the three letters referred to above, and certain required program amendments. The State has also proposed additional changes which Indiana believes will further improve the approved State program. The primary focus of the submittal is on soil capability and restoration standards, individual civil penalties, significant/non-significant revisions, coal exploration, and performance bonds.</textblock>
    <textblock>The following rulemaking actions are being proposed by Indiana:</textblock>
    <textblock>The full text of the proposed program amendment submitted by Indiana is available for public inspection at the addresses listed above. The Director now seeks public comment on whether the proposed amendment is no less effective than the Federal regulations. If approved, the amendment will become part of the Indiana program.</textblock>
