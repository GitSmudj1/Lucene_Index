    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing this action to impose sanctions on California under the discretionary sanction authority provided the Agency under the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, (CAA or Act) for failure by the State to submit a complete SIP revision for an enhanced motor vehicle inspection and maintenance (I/M) program as required by the Act for certain ozone and carbon monoxide (CO) nonattainment areas. On November 13, 1992, the California Air Resources Board (CARB), acting as the governor's designee, submitted a commitment (committal SIP) to adopt an I/M program by November 15, 1993. The committal SIP provides for the adoption and implementation of an enhanced I/M program meeting all requirements of EPA's I/M regulations and includes an implementation schedule. On June 28, 1993, EPA proposed to conditionally approve this committal SIP or alternatively to disapprove it if certain milestones contained in the schedule were missed. A full SIP revision including state legislative authority to implement the program was required by November 15, 1993. The State Legislature adjourned on September 10, 1993 without having enacted legislation providing authority for implementing the enhanced I/M program.</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 15, 1993, the State submitted a document entitled ``Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program SIP Revision'' (the ``proposed SIP revision''). The proposed SIP revision was missing critical elements required for compliance with section 182(c)(3) of the Act. On December 30, 1993, EPA Region 9 issued a letter finding that the State had failed to submit a complete SIP revision required under sections 110 and 182 of the Act. The letter dated December 30, 1993, notified the State that the proposed SIP revision was incomplete because it had not been subject to public notice. Due to the failure of the State to submit a complete SIP revision fulfilling either the requirements of the Act or its commitment to adopt and implement an enhanced I/M program as promised in its committal SIP, EPA proposes to exercise its discretionary authority under the Act to apply a statewide highway funding limitation sanction and a 2 for 1 offset sanction in all areas required to have a permit program under the new source review provisions of the Act.</textblock>
