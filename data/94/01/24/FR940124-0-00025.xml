    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>This interim rule implements section 132 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992). Section 132 establishes a demonstration program to facilitate self-sufficiency and to permit the homeownership sale of single family homes administered by the Housing Authority of the City of Omaha in the State of Nebraska. The purpose of the demonstration is to exhibit the effectiveness of promoting homeownership and providing support services.</textblock>
    <textblock>This interim rule is closely modeled on the interim rule for the Section 5(h) Homeownership Program codified in 24 CFR part 906. Section 132 specifies that the Housing Authority of the City of Omaha (hereafter the Housing Authority) is the organization to carry out the demonstration program. The Housing Authority is already administering a homeownership program approved pursuant to Section 5(h) of the United States Housing Act of 1937. In its correspondence with the Department concerning the demonstration program, the Housing Authority has indicated that it wishes to operate the demonstration program in a fashion similar to that of its existing Section 5(h) program.</textblock>
    <textblock>There are many areas of similarity between the Section 5(h) homeownership program and the demonstration program. The Department believes that, in light of the Housing Authority's desire to pattern the demonstration program upon its existing Section 5(h) homeownership program and the Department's substantial experience with the Section 5(h) homeownership program, it should use language from the existing 5(h) regulation whenever appropriate in this interim regulation.</textblock>
    <textblock>There are a number of clear differences between the demonstration and the Section 5(h) regulation. Because the demonstration program is established pursuant to legislation that is not part of the 1937 Act, it is not subject to the replacement requirements of the 1937 Act. The demonstration program also gives the Housing Authority greater freedom in selecting participant homebuyers under the program than the Section 5(h) program permits. There is, however, a specific mandate that, ``[i]n conducting the demonstration, the Housing Authority shall affirmatively further fair housing objectives.'' There is also a statutory obligation that ``[t]he Housing Authority shall ensure the availability of supportive services to each family participating in the demonstration program.''</textblock>
