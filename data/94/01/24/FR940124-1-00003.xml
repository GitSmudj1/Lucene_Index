    <textblock>There are approximately 203 Boeing Model 747 series airplanes of the affected design in the worldwide fleet. The FAA estimates that 113 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 5 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $31,075, or $275 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action.</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES.</textblock>

    <textblock>The Proposed Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง39.13</textblock>
    <textblock>[Amended]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:</textblock>
    <textblock>Boeing:</textblock>
    <textblock>Docket 93-NM-189-AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability:</textblock>
    <textblock>Model 747 series airplanes, as listed in Boeing Service Bulletin 747-53-2371, dated July 29, 1993, certificated in any category.</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance:</textblock>
    <textblock>Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.</textblock>
    <textblock>To prevent rapid decompression of the airplane due to failure of two or more tension ties, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Prior to the accumulation of 1,000 flight cycles after the effective date of this AD, unless accomplished previously within the last 2,000 flight cycles, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking of the outboard end tension ties, in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747-53-2371, dated July 29, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) If no cracking is detected, repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,000 flight cycles until the repair or modification required by paragraph (a)(2) of this AD is accomplished.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) If any cracking is detected, prior to further flight, repair or modify the cracked tension tie in accordance with the service bulletin. Accomplishment of this repair or modification terminates the repetitive inspection requirement of paragraph (a) of this AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note 1:</textblock>
    <textblock>Although AD 84-19-01, amendment 39-4913, requires inspections of the tension ties at body station (BS) 760 on a certain group of Model 747 series airplanes, and at BS 780 on certain other Model 747 series airplanes, the inspections required by this AD do not retract the inspection requirements of that AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Prior to the accumulation of 10,000 flight cycles following repair or modification of any tension tie, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect cracking of the repaired or modified outboard end tension tie in accordance with Boeing Service Bulletin 747-53-2371, dated July 29, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) If no cracking is detected, repeat this inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 6,000 flight cycles.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) If any cracking is detected, prior to further flight, repair or modify in accordance with the service bulletin, and repeat the inspection required by paragraph (b) of this AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Seattle Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Seattle ACO.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note 2:</textblock>
    <textblock>Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Seattle ACO.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.</textblock>
    <textblock>Issued in Renton, Washington, on January 18, 1994.</textblock>
