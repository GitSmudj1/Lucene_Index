    <textblock>In accordance with provisions of 30 CFR 732.17(h), OSM is now seeking comment on whether the amendment proposed by Indiana satisfies the requirements of 30 CFR 732.15 for the approval of State program amendments. If the amendment is deemed adequate, it will become part of the Indiana program.</textblock>
    <textblock>Written Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>Written comments should be specific, pertain only to issues proposed in this rulemaking, and include explanations in support of the commenter's recommendations. Comments received after the time indicated under ``</textblock>
    <textblock>DATES</textblock>
    <textblock>'' or at locations other than the Indianapolis Field Office will not necessarily be considered in the final rulemaking or included in the Administrative Record.</textblock>
    <textblock>Public Hearing</textblock>
    <textblock>Persons wishing to comment at the public hearing should contact the person listed under ``</textblock>
    <textblock>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</textblock>
    <textblock>'' by the close of business on February 9, 1994. If no one requests an opportunity to comment at a public hearing, the hearing will not be held.</textblock>
    <textblock>Filing of a written statement at the time of the hearing is requested as it will greatly assist the transcriber. Submission of written statements in advance of the hearing will allow OSM officials to prepare adequate responses and appropriate questions.</textblock>
    <textblock>The public hearing will continue on the specified date until all persons scheduled to comment have been heard. Persons in the audience who have not been scheduled to comment and who wish to do so will be heard following those scheduled. The hearing will end after all persons who desire to comment have been heard.</textblock>
    <textblock>Public Meeting</textblock>
    <textblock>If only one person requests an opportunity to comment at a hearing, a public meeting, rather than a public hearing, may be held. Persons wishing to meet with OSM representatives to discuss the proposed amendment may request a meeting at the Indianapolis Field Office by contacting the person listed under ``</textblock>
    <textblock>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</textblock>
    <textblock>.'' All such meetings will be open to the public and, if possible, notices of meetings will be posted in advance at the locations listed above under ``</textblock>
    <textblock>ADDRESSES</textblock>
    <textblock>.'' A summary of the meeting will be included in the Administrative Record.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12866</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12778</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 and has determined that, to the extent allowed by law, this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 1255) and 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15 and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.</textblock>
    <textblock>National Environmental Policy Act</textblock>
    <textblock>No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).</textblock>
    <textblock>Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq</textblock>
    <textblock>). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.</textblock>
