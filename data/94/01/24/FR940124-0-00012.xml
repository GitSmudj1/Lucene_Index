    <textblock>Retroactive application of SMCRA regulations is committed to the discretion of the Secretary.</textblock>
    <textblock>See id.</textblock>
    <textblock>at 13, n. 4. However, retroactive application is inconsistent with the traditional presumption that regulations are prospective, not retroactive, and that advance notice of their application must be provided. With respect to the current rulemaking, Wyoming did not propose to apply these amendments retroactively, and the Secretary is adverse to imposing such a requirement in the absence of a compelling reason to do so. The Powder River plaintiff appears to be the only party that would be affected positively by a retroactive application. This plaintiff did not rely to its detriment on the existence of cost recovery provisions in the Wyoming program, but has instead labored for their addition to the program. In addition, the underlying permit challenge was maintained despite the absence of the provisions sought by the plaintiff.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary is reluctant to impose upon Wyoming the obligation to pay past costs and expenses on the basis of retroactive application of provisions that, prior to this rulemaking, have not been part of the State's approved program. However, the Secretary's decision not to require retroactive application of these amendments does not preclude Wyoming from paying all or part of the plaintiff's costs and expenses if the State is so inclined.</textblock>
    <textblock>VI. Effect of Secretary's Decision</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not exercise primary jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved by the Secretary of the Interior. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(a) require that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted to OSM for review as a program amendment. The Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable by the State as part of the approved State program until they are approved by the Secretary or the Director. In oversight of the Wyoming program, the Director will recognize only those statutes, regulations, and other materials approved by the Director, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives and other materials, and will require the enforcement by Wyoming of only such provisions.</textblock>
    <textblock>VII. Procedural Determinations</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance With Executive Order 12866</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule is exempt from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review).</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance With Executive Order 12778</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsection (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance With the National Environmental Policy Act</textblock>
    <textblock>No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).</textblock>
