However, no person who is a tenant of public housing may be involuntarily relocated or displaced (forced to relocate permanently) from his or her dwelling as a result of the demonstration program. A violation of this relocation/ displacement prohibition may, in addition to applicable program sanctions, trigger a requirement to provide relocation assistance in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, and implementing rules.</textblock>

    <textblock>As soon as feasible after they can be identified, all nonpurchasing residents shall be given written notice of their options under this section.

    <textblock>(3) Replacement housing assistance sufficient to permit relocation to suitable, decent, safe and sanitary replacement housing (at a rent no higher than permitted by the 1937 Act) in accordance with the relocation assistance component of the HUD-approved homeownership assistance program. This requirement will be met if the resident is offered the opportunity to relocate to another suitable dwelling under the Public Housing Program, any of the housing assistance programs under Section 8 of the 1937 Act, or any other Federal, State, or local program that is comparable, as to standards for housing quality, admission and rent, to the programs under the 1937 Act, and provides a term of assistance of at least five years.</textblock>
