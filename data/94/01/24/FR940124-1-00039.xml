    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies. The proposed regulations are needed to implement provisions added to the Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA) by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The purpose of the Secretary's recognition of accrediting agencies is to assure that those agencies are, for HEA and other Federal purposes, reliable authorities as to the quality of education or training offered by the institutions of higher education or higher education programs they accredit.</textblock>
