    <textblock>Agency Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to Section 503(b) of SMCRA and implementing regulations at 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(i), comments were solicited from various Federal agencies with an actual or potential interest in the Wyoming program. A summary of the comments, and the Director's responses to them, appear below:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The U.S. Department of Interior (USDI)_Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, USDI_Bureau of Mines, USDI_Bureau of Reclamation, U.S. Department of Labor_Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)_Arlington, and U.S. Department of Labor_Mine Safety and Health District 9, responded with no comment (Administrative Record Nos. WY-21-7, WY-21-41, WY-21-65, WY-21-8, WY-21-12, WY-21-32, WY-21-59, WY-21-14, WY-21-4, WY-21-31, WY-21-56, and WY-21-28).</textblock>
    <textblock>2. The USDI_Geological Survey responded to the rule portion of the amendment by praising the botanical approach to this portion of the Wyoming regulations (Administrative Record No. WY-21-11).</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The U.S. Department of Agriculture_Soil Conservation Service commented that the SCS supports the proposed rule amendment and feels that it is quite workable (Administrative Record Nos. WY-21-9, WY-21-24, and WY-21-66).</textblock>
    <textblock>4. U.S. Department of Agriculture_Forest Service_Rocky Mountain Region commented that the proposed rule plan is well written and well thought out. They additionally suggested that weed free native hay be required rather than preferred as proposed in Appendix A (Administrative Record No. WY-21-13). As previously noted, neither the proposed rule nor the modification to the appendix can be approved. Therefore, the suggested requirements for weed free native hay becomes moot to this rulemaking action.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. U.S. Department of Agriculture_Agricultural Research Service_Northern Plains Area recommended changes to the proposed rules and appendix. As discussed in Finding 6, the Director is not approving the proposed rules and appendix. Thus changes to them need not be discussed at this time (Administrative Record No. WY-21-10).</textblock>
    <textblock>6. The U.S. Department of Interior_U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS or the Service) provided substantial comments on February 16, April 14, and November 22, 1993 (Administrative Record Nos. WY-21-5, WY-21-19, and WY-21-64). The comments supported the proposed rules and appendix but not the statutory language. They additionally recommended several changes to the proposed rules. As discussed above, the majority of the proposed rules conflict with the statutory language and OSM is not approving either the proposed rules or statutory provisions.</textblock>
    <textblock>7. The U.S. Department of Interior_Bureau of Land Management (BLM) provided substantial comments on March 10 and December 3, 1993 (Administrative Record Nos. WY-21-15 and WY-21-67). Again the comments supported the proposed rules and appendix, therefore discussion of BLM's comments would be of no merit.</textblock>
    <textblock>State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO) and Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>As required by 30 CFR 732.17(h)(4), OSM provided the proposed amendment to the SHPO and ACHP for comment. No comments were received from the ACHP. The Wyoming Division of Parks and Cultural Resources_State Historic Preservation Office commented by reminding OSM that management of cultural resources on OSM projects is conducted in accordance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act and Advisory Council regulations at 36 CFR 800. The SHPO had no objections to the proposed Wyoming amendment provided that OSM follows the procedures established in these regulations. The Director assures the SHPO that OSM will follow the procedures established in the Advisory Council rules at 36 CFR 800.</textblock>
    <textblock>Environmental Protection Agency Concurrence</textblock>
    <textblock>Under 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director is required to obtain the written concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) with respect to provisions of a State program amendment which relate to air or water quality standards promulgated under the authority of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq</textblock>
    <textblock>.) or the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq</textblock>
    <textblock>.).</textblock>
    <textblock>On October 25, 1993, the EPA concurred without comment regarding Wyoming's proposed amendment (Administrative Record No. WY-21-57).</textblock>
    <textblock>V. Director's Decision</textblock>
    <textblock>Based on the above findings, the Director is not approving Wyoming's proposed program amendment as submitted January 6, 1993, and April 13, 1993, and clarified on October 7, 1993. The Director is requiring program amendments at 30 CFR 950.16 as discussed in Findings 1, 2, 3, 4.a., 5,</textblock>
    <textblock>and 6.</textblock>
