    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes regulations to implement the State Postsecondary Review Program (SPRP) authorized under title IV, part H, subpart 1 of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA). Under the SPRP, the Secretary enters into an agreement with a State in which the State designates a postsecondary review entity (SPRE) that is responsible for conducting or coordinating reviews of institutions of higher education referred to the State by the Secretary under specific statutory provisions. The purpose of the reviews is to determine whether those institutions should continue to participate in the Title IV, HEA programs. The SPRE reviews institutions on the basis of standards developed in consultation with institutions located in the State. The Secretary reimburses SPREs for costs they incur under the SPRP.</textblock>
