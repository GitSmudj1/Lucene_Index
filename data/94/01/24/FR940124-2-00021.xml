No camping is allowed at or within one (1) mile of Hobo Camp or Devil's Corral trailheads and is prohibited along the south side road that extends west of Hobo Camp within the Susan River Canyon. Under special circumstances and upon request, the authorized officer may give written permission for extension of these limits.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>This occupancy and camping stay limit is being established to provide consistency and uniformity for the camping public on Bureau of Land Management administered lands throughout the Susanville District, California, and to prevent user conflicts by providing equal opportunities to camp in given areas. Establishment of this length of stay limit is also to assist the Bureau in reducing the incidence of unauthorized occupancy of public lands in the name of recreational camping. These supplementary rules do not supersede camping and occupancy rules developed for special areas or emergency situations. The supplementary rules are to protect resources and to improve the safety of recreational users of the public lands.</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority for this stay and the supplementary rules are contained in CFR title 43, chapter II, part 8360, subparts 8365.1-2 (a) and 8365.1-6.</textblock>
    <textblock>PENALTIES:</textblock>
    <textblock>Violations of any regulations in this part by a member of the public, except for the provisions of 8365.1-7, are punishable by fine not to exceed $1,000 and/or imprisonment not to exceed 12 months. Violations of supplementary rules authorized by 8365.1-6 are punishable in the same manner.</textblock>
