    <textblock>A public meeting was requested and held on June 8, 1993. The summary notes for that meeting are available for public review (administrative record No. WY-21-49).</textblock>
    <textblock>During its review of the amendment, OSM identified various concerns in the proposed regulations and legislation, including the conflicting nature of the proposed rules and statute. OSM notified Wyoming of these concerns by letter dated August 17, 1993 (Administrative Record No. WY-21-50).</textblock>
    <textblock>Wyoming responded to these concerns by letter dated October 7, 1993, with additional information (Administrative Record No. WY-21-51). Wyoming's submittal included a table identifying the proposed statutes and rules that conflict with each other, those that complement one another, and discussions on some of the concerns in the issue letter.</textblock>
    <textblock>OSM published a third notice in the October 22, 1993,</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(58 FR 54540) announcing receipt of this additional information; reopening and extending the comment period. The public comment period closed on November 8, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Director's Findings</textblock>
    <textblock>Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning the amendment submitted by Wyoming on January 6, 1993, and April 13, 1993, and subsequently clarified on October 7, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. W.S. 35-11-103(e)(xxviii): Definition of Agricultural Lands</textblock>
    <textblock>Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35-11-103(e)(xxviii) a definition as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(e) (xxviii) ``Agricultural lands'' means cropland, pastureland, hayland, or grazingland;</textblock>
    <textblock>Neither SMCRA nor the implementing Federal regulations include a definition of agricultural lands. Wyoming's proposed statutory definition appears to make explicit what land uses are considered agricultural in nature. Wyoming is combining specific land uses into a general category but still maintains the individual land use definitions in its program. Nothing in the Federal program would preclude such combining of land uses into a single category so long as it does not result in being inconsistent with the Federal and State program requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the August 17, 1993, letter, OSM cautioned the State regarding the exclusion of ``agricultural lands'' from lands that can contain habitat of unusually high value as proposed at W.S. 35-11-103(e)(xxx) (see discussion at Finding 3). Wyoming did not address this concern in its October 7, 1993, reply. It appears that the sole purpose of the proposed statutory definition of ``Agricultural lands'' is its use in the proposed statutory definition of ``Important habitat or crucial habitat''. Thus the proposed definition would cause the State program to be inconsistent with the Federal program requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, the definition of ``Agricultural lands'' as is proposed to be used at W.S. 35-11-103(e)(xxx) would not be in accordance with the Federal requirements. The Director is: (1) not approving the definition; and (2) is requiring Wyoming to either clarify how the definition would not render its program less stringent than SMCRA requirements and less effective than the Federal regulation requirements or repeal the definition.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. W.S. 35-11-103(e)(xxix): Definition of Critical Habitat</textblock>
    <textblock>Wyoming proposes at W.S. 35-11-103(e) a new definition as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(xxix) ``Critical habitat'' means only that fish and wildlife habitat designated as critical by the United States Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of Commerce, for the survival and recovery of listed threatened and endangered species;</textblock>
    <textblock>Neither SMCRA nor the implementing Federal regulations define critical habitat. Wyoming's LQD rules at Chapter I, Section 2(v) already define the term critical habitat. However, based on Wyoming's clarification submitted October 7, 1993, this rule definition is superseded by the proposed statutory definition (Administrative Record No. WY-21-51).</textblock>
    <textblock>All references to critical habitat in the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 780/784.16 and 816/817.97 cite critical habitats listed by the Secretary under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>). Under section 3 of ESA, a critical habitat is the specific areas within the geographical area occupied by the species, at the time it is listed in accordance with provisions of Section 4 of this Act, on which are found those physical or biological features (I) essential to the conservation of the species and (II) which may require special management consideration or protection; and (III) specific areas outside the geographical area occupied by the species at the time it is listed *␣*␣* that such areas are essential for the conservation of the species.</textblock>
