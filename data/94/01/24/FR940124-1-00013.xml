    <textblock>(a) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, exposure to the specified vesicant agents during active military service under the circumstances described below in paragraphs (a)(1) through (3) of this section together with the subsequent development of any of the indicated conditions is sufficient to establish service connection for that condition:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Any verified full-body exposure to nitrogen or sulfur mustard during active military service together with the subsequent development of chronic conjunctivitis, keratitis, corneal opacities, scar formation, or the following cancers: nasopharyngeal; laryngeal; lung (except mesothelioma); or, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.</textblock>
