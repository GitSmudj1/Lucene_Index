    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) has prepared an Environmental Assessment for issuance of a section 10(a)(1)(B) permit for the incidental take of the Federally endangered golden-cheeked warbler (</textblock>
    <textblock>Dendroica chrysoparia</textblock>
    <textblock>) during construction and operation of a 496 acre mixed residential and commercial development known as Lake Pointe in Austin, Travis County, Texas.</textblock>
    <textblock>Proposed Action</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed action is the issuance of a permit under section 10(a)(1)(B) of the Endangered Species Act to authorize the incidental take of the golden-cheeked warbler.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Applicant plans to build 850 single-family residences, a 10-acre commercial site, an elementary school, and associated streets and utility corridors in southwest Travis County, Texas. The development will occupy approximately 354 acres with the remaining 142 acres for open space, conducting golden-cheeked warbler monitoring studies, providing $90,000 to fund the acquisition of golden-cheeked warbler habitat preserves, and constructing and maintaining a fence between the proposed development and the areas of open space set aside for the golden-cheeked warbler. Details of the mitigation are provided in the Lake Pointe Habitat Conservation Plan. Guarantees for implementation are provided in the Agreement and the Management Agreement.</textblock>
    <textblock>These conservation plan actions ensure that the criteria established for issuance of an incidental take permit will be fully satisfied.</textblock>
    <textblock>Alternatives Considered</textblock>
    <textblock>1. No action,</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Proposed action,</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Alternate project location,</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Reduce the proposed project, and</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Wait for the completion of the Balcones Canyonlands Conservation Plan Section 10(a) permit.</textblock>
    <textblock>Determination</textblock>
    <textblock>Based upon information contained in the Environmental Assessment and the Habitat Conservation Plan, the Service has determined that this action is not a major Federal action which would significantly affect the quality of the human environment within the meaning of section 102(2)(c) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969. Accordingly, the preparation of an Environmental Impact Statement on the proposed action is not required.</textblock>
    <textblock>It is my decision to approve the issuance of the section 10(a)(1)(B) permit for the construction of the 496 acre mixed residential/commercial development known as Lake Pointe Development in Austin, Travis County, Texas.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dated: January 12, 1994.</textblock>
