    <textblock>Administrative Garnishment.</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) If a guaranty agency</textblock>
    <textblock>decides to garnish the disposable pay of a borrower who is not</textblock>
    <textblock>making payments on a loan held by the agency, on which the</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary has paid a reinsurance claim, it shall do so in</textblock>
    <textblock>accordance with the following procedures:</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) The employer shall deduct and pay to the agency from a</textblock>
    <textblock>borrower's wages an amount that does not exceed 10 percent of the</textblock>
    <textblock>borrower's disposable pay for each pay period, or the amount</textblock>
    <textblock>permitted by 15 U.S.C. 1673, unless the borrower provides the</textblock>
    <textblock>agency with written consent to deduct a greater amount. For this</textblock>
    <textblock>purpose, the term ``disposable pay'' means that part of the</textblock>
    <textblock>borrower's compensation from an employer remaining after the</textblock>
    <textblock>deduction of any amounts required by law to be withheld.</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) At least 30 days before the initiation of garnishment</textblock>
    <textblock>proceedings, the guaranty agency shall mail to the borrower's</textblock>
    <textblock>last known address, a written notice of the nature and amount of</textblock>
    <textblock>the debt, the intention of the agency to initiate proceedings to</textblock>
    <textblock>collect the debt through deductions from pay, and an explanation</textblock>
    <textblock>of the borrower's rights.</textblock>
    <textblock>(C) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an</textblock>
    <textblock>opportunity to inspect and copy agency records related to the</textblock>
    <textblock>debt.</textblock>
    <textblock>(D) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an</textblock>
    <textblock>opportunity to enter into a written repayment agreement with the</textblock>
    <textblock>agency under terms agreeable to the agency.</textblock>
    <textblock>(E) The guaranty agency shall offer the borrower an</textblock>
    <textblock>opportunity for a hearing in accordance with paragraph</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)(10)(i)(J) of this section concerning the existence or the</textblock>
    <textblock>amount of the debt and, in the case of a borrower whose repayment</textblock>
    <textblock>schedule is established other than by a written agreement under</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph (b)(10)(i)(D) of this section, the terms of the</textblock>
    <textblock>repayment schedule.</textblock>
    <textblock>(F) The guaranty agency shall sue any employer (including a</textblock>
    <textblock>borrower who is self-employed) for any amount that the employer,</textblock>
    <textblock>after receipt of the garnishment notice provided by the agency</textblock>
    <textblock>under paragraph (b)(10)(i)(H) of this section, fails to withhold</textblock>
    <textblock>from wages owed and payable to an employee under the employer's</textblock>
    <textblock>normal pay and disbursement cycle.</textblock>
    <textblock>(G) The guaranty agency may not garnish the wages of a</textblock>
    <textblock>borrower whom it knows has been involuntarily separated from</textblock>
    <textblock>employment until the borrower has been reemployed continuously</textblock>
    <textblock>for at least 12 months.</textblock>
    <textblock>(H) Unless the guaranty agency receives information that the</textblock>
    <textblock>agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the</textblock>
    <textblock>withholding order, it shall send a withholding order to the</textblock>
    <textblock>employer within 20 days after the borrower fails to make a timely</textblock>
    <textblock>request for a hearing, or, if a timely request for a hearing is</textblock>
    <textblock>made by the borrower, within 20 days after a final decision is</textblock>
    <textblock>made by the agency to proceed with garnishment.</textblock>
    <textblock>(I) The notice given to the employer under paragraph</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)(10)(i)(H) of this section must contain only the information</textblock>
    <textblock>as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the</textblock>
    <textblock>withholding order.</textblock>
    <textblock>(J) The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing, which, at</textblock>
    <textblock>the borrower's option, may be oral or written, if the borrower</textblock>
    <textblock>submits a written request for a hearing on the existence or</textblock>
    <textblock>amount of the debt or the terms of the repayment schedule. An</textblock>
    <textblock>oral hearing may, at the borrower's option, be conducted either</textblock>
    <textblock>in-person or by telephone conference. All telephonic charges</textblock>
    <textblock>must be the responsibility of the guaranty agency.</textblock>
