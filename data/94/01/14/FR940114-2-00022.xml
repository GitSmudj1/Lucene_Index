    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The SOPAG is being renewed for a two-year period in consonance with the public interest, and in accordance with the provisions of Public Law 92-463, the ``Federal Advisory Committee Act.''</textblock>
    <textblock>The SOPAG provides advice to the Secretary of Defense, the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations and Low Intensity Conflict (SOLIC) on key issues related to the formulation of policy concerning special operations and low intensity conflict matters. The types of activities for which the SOPAG renders advice include: strategic and tactical reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, theater search and rescue, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, special forces operations, and humanitarian assistance.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Group will continue to be a well-balanced unit, composed of approximately ten members, who are recognized experts in military activities focusing on special operations. Members will be selected from among DoD military and civilian officials, retired flag officers, former diplomatic representatives, and academic and other private communities, to ensure a balanced perspective from the standpoint of functions performed and interest groups represented.</textblock>
    <textblock>For further information regarding the SOPAG, contact: Col. Dick Blair, Office of the Assistant Secretary (SOLIC), (703) 693-2896.</textblock>
