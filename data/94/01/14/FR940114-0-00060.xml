    <textblock>7. Section 3280.305 is amended by adding a new paragraph (b)(4) and by</textblock>
    <textblock>revising paragraphs (a), (b)(3), (c)(1) and (2); adding a heading for (c)(3) introductory text; and revising (c)(3) (iii), (c)(4), (d), and (e), to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§3280.305</textblock>
    <textblock>Structural design requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>General</textblock>
    <textblock>. Each manufactured home shall be designed and constructed as a completely integrated structure capable of sustaining the design load requirements of this standard, and shall be capable of transmitting these loads to stabilizing devices without exceeding the allowable stresses or deflections. Roof framing shall be securely fastened to wall framing, walls to floor structure, and floor structure to chassis to secure and maintain continuity between the floor and chassis, so as to resist wind overturning, uplift, and sliding as imposed by design loads in this part. Uncompressed finished flooring greater than 1/8 inch in thickness shall not extend beneath load-bearing walls that are fastened to the floor structure.</textblock>

    <textblock>_ *␣*␣*</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) When engineering calculations are performed, allowable unit</textblock>
    <textblock>stresses may be increased as provided in the documents referenced in</textblock>
    <textblock>§3280.304 except as otherwise indicated in §§3280.304(b)(1) and 3280.306(a).</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Whenever the roof slope does not exceed 20 degrees, the design</textblock>
    <textblock>horizontal wind loads required by §3280.305(c)(1) may be determined without</textblock>
    <textblock>including the vertical roof projection of the manufactured home. However,</textblock>
    <textblock>regardless of the roof slope of the manufactured home, the vertical roof</textblock>
    <textblock>projection shall be included when determining the wind loading for split level</textblock>
    <textblock>or clerestory-type roof systems.</textblock>

    <textblock>(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>Standard wind Loads (Zone I)</textblock>
    <textblock>. When a manufactured home is not designed to resist the wind loads for high wind areas (Zone II or Zone III) specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, the manufactured home and each of its wind resisting parts and portions shall be designed for</textblock>
    <textblock>horizontal wind loads of not less than 15 psf and net uplift load of not less</textblock>
    <textblock>than 9 psf.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii)</textblock>
    <textblock>Wind loads for high wind areas (Zone II and Zone III)</textblock>
    <textblock>. When</textblock>
    <textblock>designed for high wind areas (Zone II and Zone III), the manufactured home,</textblock>
    <textblock>each of its wind resisting parts (including, but not limited to, shear walls,</textblock>
    <textblock>diaphragms, ridge beams, and their fastening and anchoring systems), and its</textblock>
    <textblock>components and cladding materials (including, but not limited to, roof</textblock>
    <textblock>trusses, wall studs, exterior sheathing, roofing and siding materials,</textblock>
    <textblock>exterior glazing, and their connections and fasteners) shall be designed by a</textblock>
    <textblock>Professional Engineer or Architect to resist:</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) The design wind loads for Exposure C specified in ANSI/ASCE 7-88,</textblock>
    <textblock>``Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures,'' for a fifty-year</textblock>
    <textblock>recurrence interval, and a design wind speed of 100 mph, as specified for Wind</textblock>
    <textblock>Zone II, or 110 mph, as specified for Wind Zone III (Basic Wind Zone Map); or</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) The wind pressures specified in the following Table:</textblock>
