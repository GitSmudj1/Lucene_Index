    <textblock>guaranty agency on or before the 15th day following the</textblock>
    <textblock>borrower's receipt of the notice described in paragraph</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)(10)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency may not issue</textblock>
    <textblock>a withholding order until the borrower has been provided the</textblock>
    <textblock>requested hearing. The guaranty agency shall provide a hearing</textblock>
    <textblock>to the borrower in sufficient time to permit a decision, in</textblock>
    <textblock>accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe, to</textblock>
    <textblock>be rendered within 60 days.</textblock>
    <textblock>(L) If the borrower's written request is received by the</textblock>

    <textblock>receipt of the notice described in paragraph (b)(10)(i)(B) of</textblock>
    <textblock>this section, the guaranty agency shall provide a hearing to the</textblock>
    <textblock>borrower in sufficient time that a decision, in accordance with</textblock>
    <textblock>the procedures that the agency may prescribe, may be rendered</textblock>
    <textblock>within 60 days, but may not delay issuance of a withholding order</textblock>
    <textblock>unless the agency determines that the delay in filing the request</textblock>
    <textblock>was caused by factors over which the borrower had no control.</textblock>
    <textblock>(M) A hearing may not be conducted by an individual under</textblock>
    <textblock>the supervision or control of the head of the guaranty agency,</textblock>
    <textblock>except that an agency may appoint an administrative law judge to</textblock>
    <textblock>conduct the hearing.</textblock>
    <textblock>(N) The hearing official shall issue a final written</textblock>
    <textblock>decision at the earliest practicable date, but not later than 60</textblock>
    <textblock>days after the guaranty agency's receipt of the borrower's</textblock>
    <textblock>hearing request.</textblock>
    <textblock>(O) As specified in section 488A(a)(8) of the HEA, the</textblock>
    <textblock>borrower may seek judicial relief, including punitive damages, if</textblock>
    <textblock>the employer discharges, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary</textblock>
    <textblock>action against the borrower due to the issuance of a withholding</textblock>
    <textblock>order.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) References to ``the borrower'' in this paragraph include</textblock>

    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) At least two of the collection letters required under</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph (d)(1) of this section must warn the borrower that if</textblock>
    <textblock>the loan is not paid, the lender will assign the loan to the</textblock>
    <textblock>guaranty agency that, in turn, will report the default to all</textblock>
    <textblock>national credit bureaus, and that the agency may institute a</textblock>
    <textblock>proceeding to garnish the borrower's wages and bring suit against</textblock>
    <textblock>the borrower to compel repayment of the loan.</textblock>
