    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department will consider this suggestion for future</textblock>
    <textblock>rulemaking on wind load requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>Special standards should be required for asphalt shingle</textblock>
    <textblock>performance in high wind areas, because of the large number of failures that</textblock>
    <textblock>occurred in Hurricane Andrew and ensuing structural and water damage caused by</textblock>
    <textblock>these failures.</textblock>
    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>The asphalt shingle industry research is not yet completed in</textblock>
    <textblock>this area. As an interim step, this final rule requires each shingle to be</textblock>
    <textblock>secured with two additional fasteners and underlayment to be cemented to the</textblock>
    <textblock>roof decking.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>Testing requirements should be specified for windows and doors</textblock>
    <textblock>to avoid missile damage in high winds. Safety standards can be enhanced</textblock>
    <textblock>without affecting affordability, by requiring operating shutters and proper</textblock>
    <textblock>anchoring (88</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>).</textblock>
    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department encourages manufacturers to provide shutters</textblock>
    <textblock>or protective devices for homes in Wind Zones II and III. Under this rule</textblock>
    <textblock>manufacturers will be required, at a minimum, to provide instructions for an</textblock>
    <textblock>appropriate method of shutter or cover installation to protect the home, and</textblock>
    <textblock>to include shutter information on the data plate. The instructions must</textblock>
    <textblock>provide a method for protecting the windows and doors that is capable of</textblock>
    <textblock>withstanding design wind pressures without taking the home out of conformance</textblock>
    <textblock>with the standards. The application of shutters does not do away with the</textblock>
    <textblock>need for testing the doors or windows they protect.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>A requirement should be added for the use of perforated metal</textblock>
    <textblock>straps at the marriage line of the roof, between sections of doublewides, to</textblock>
    <textblock>transfer wind forces from the windward to the leeward side of the roof.</textblock>
    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>As part of its continuing evaluation of wind design</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements, the Department will assess the merits of this proposal.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department needs to establish standards to regulate the</textblock>
    <textblock>addition of appurtenances to manufactured homes, such as porches, carports,</textblock>
    <textblock>and canopies, which experienced a large number of failures in Hurricane</textblock>
    <textblock>Andrew. The danger to occupants is further increased because the rule does</textblock>
    <textblock>not address the effect of dangerous appurtenances (52, 65, 122).</textblock>
    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>Under 24 CFR 3282.8(j) the standards currently do not govern</textblock>
    <textblock>add-ons, as long as the add-on doesn't affect the ability of the home to</textblock>
    <textblock>comply with the standards. However, as noted in that section, the Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>has authority to promulgate standards for some add-ons. Accordingly, the</textblock>
    <textblock>Department is examining its authority in this area and may establish</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements in the future. In the interim, HUD encourages all States to</textblock>
    <textblock>establish standards covering the construction and attachment of these kinds of</textblock>
    <textblock>appurtenances to manufactured homes.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>Exposure D in ASCE 7-88 should be used for coastal shoreline</textblock>
    <textblock>areas.</textblock>
    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>Under this rule manufacturers are required to include on the</textblock>
    <textblock>data plate a statement that units designed to meet the minimum standards in</textblock>
    <textblock>this rule should not be located within 1500 feet of the coastline in Zones II</textblock>
    <textblock>and III. By this statement, the consumer is alerted that only units designed</textblock>
    <textblock>and anchored according to the higher design standards specified for coastal</textblock>
    <textblock>areas in ASCE 7-88 should be placed along the coastline.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>``Wind safety'' is a misnomer; the science of weather</textblock>
    <textblock>forecasting allows ample notice of dangerous storms to permit evacuation (296-314). Homeowner safety is better served by evacuation in high winds than from</textblock>
    <textblock>protection afforded by the manufactured home structure. If a manufactured</textblock>
    <textblock>home is purported to be designed and constructed to withstand higher wind</textblock>
    <textblock>speeds, occupants may be less likely to evacuate the homes at the approach of</textblock>
    <textblock>a dangerous storm.</textblock>
    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department agrees that if it is safe to do so,</textblock>
    <textblock>homeowners should attempt to reach a shelter capable of resisting high winds.</textblock>
    <textblock>However, without the imposition of these enhanced Wind Safety Standards, the</textblock>
    <textblock>numbers of deaths and injuries attributable to the inadequate performance of</textblock>
    <textblock>manufactured homes in high winds will continue unabated. In addition to</textblock>
    <textblock>reducing deaths and injuries, the Department's statutory responsibilities</textblock>
    <textblock>require the implementation of higher wind standards to reduce the insurance</textblock>
    <textblock>cost and amount of property damage resulting from manufactured home accidents</textblock>
    <textblock>and improvement of the quality and durability of manufactured homes. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Department believes that these higher wind standards will fulfill those</textblock>
    <textblock>responsibilities.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>The NIST study cited by the Department does not fault the</textblock>
    <textblock>performance of trusses; increasing the uplift requirements would not improve</textblock>
    <textblock>the quality of assembly. The problems associated with manufactured housing</textblock>
    <textblock>are related more to fasteners and tiedowns (13</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>).</textblock>
    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>The field studies referenced in the NIST Report identified</textblock>
    <textblock>numerous roof system failures that were generally due to failure of the end</textblock>
    <textblock>connections between the trusses and the sidewalls. However, even if the</textblock>
    <textblock>trusses had been properly connected to the manufactured home structure, the</textblock>
    <textblock>Department believes that trusses not designed to resist the uplift pressures</textblock>
    <textblock>referenced in this rule still may have failed. Therefore, in this final rule</textblock>
    <textblock>the Department has retained the proposed increased design requirements for</textblock>
    <textblock>roof trusses.</textblock>
