    <textblock>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') is amending Regulation 1.41 to revise the Commission's requirements with respect to the number of copies of rule change proposals that an exchange must provide to the Commission. The Commission also is adopting amendments that would revise certain of the procedures and standards set forth in the Commission's expedited approval rules, Regulations 1.41(h) through 1.41(t), to reflect recent innovations by the exchanges as well as miscellaneous amendments to the procedural aspects of the expedited approval rules. Other proposed amendments include miscellaneous clarifying amendments to the Commission's Guideline No. 1.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Introduction</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 5a(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act''), 7 U.S.C. 7a(12), provides that all rules</textblock>
    <textblock>of a contract market which relate to terms and conditions</textblock>
    <textblock>in futures or option contracts traded on or subject to the rules of a contract market must be submitted to the Commission for its prior approval. Section 5a(a)(12) further requires that contract markets submit all other rules to the Commission. Such other rules may be made effective ten days after Commission receipt unless, within the ten-day period, the Exchange requests Commission approval or the Commission notifies the Exchange that it intends to review the rules for approval.</textblock>
    <textblock>Commission Regulation 1.41 sets forth procedures for submitting proposed exchange rules for Commission approval, permitting certain exchange rules to go into effect without Commission approval, and dealing with exchange emergency rules. All proposed exchange rules relating to the terms and conditions of a commodity futures or option contract must, and any other rule may, be submitted for prior Commission approval, under Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act, pursuant to procedures set forth in Regulation 1.41(b). Regulation 1.41(c) sets forth the submission requirements for rules that do not relate to terms and conditions and which may be placed into effect without Commission approval ten days after receipt by the Commission. Regulation 1.41(d) sets forth the submission requirements for rules that are exempt from the requirements of Section 5a(a)(12) of the Act. Regulations 1.41(h) through (t) set forth conditions under which, in lieu of submission under Regulation 1.41(b), certain types of exchange rule proposals relating to terms and conditions requiring Commission approval may be deemed approved either upon adoption by the exchange or within a specified number of days of Commission receipt, which ranges from one to ten days.</textblock>
