    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 200.7(b)(2) of the Board's regulations provides that:</textblock>
    <textblock>Interest shall accrue from the date on which notice of the debt and demand for repayment with interest is first mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor, or in the case of a debt which is subject to section 10(c) of the Railroad Retirement Act or section 2(d) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act, interest shall accrue from the date that a denial of waiver or recovery is mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor or, if waiver has not been requested, upon the expiration of the time within which to request wavier, except as otherwise specified in this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 200.7(c) of the regulations provides that:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) A penalty charge of 6 percent per year shall be assessed on any debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The penalty charge shall accrue from the date on which the debt became delinquent.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) A debt is delinquent if it has not been paid in full by the 30th day after the date on which the initial demand letter was first mailed or hand-delivered, or, if the debt is being repaid under an installment payment agreement, at any time after the debtor fails to satisfy his or her obligation for payment thereunder.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 12(o) of the Railroad Unemployment Insurance Act provides that benefits payable to an employee with respect to days of sickness shall be payable regardless of the liability of any person to pay damages for such infirmity. The Board shall be entitled to reimbursement from any sum or damages paid or payable to such employee or other person through suits, compromise, settlement, judgment, or otherwise on account of any liability (other than a liability under health, sickness, accident, or similar insurance policy) based upon such infirmity, to the extent that it will have paid or will pay benefits for days of sickness resulting from such infirmity. Upon notice to the person against whom such right or claim exists or is asserted, the Board shall have a lien upon such right or claim, any judgment obtained thereunder, and any sum or damages paid under such right or claim, to the extent of the amount to which the Board is entitled by way of reimbursement.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 341.6 of the Board's regulations provides that a person or company subject to the lien must notify the agency within five days of a settlement or judgment and must pay the agency the amount withheld to satisfy the lien within 30 days. In the case where a lien arises in favor of the Board as a result of a settlement or judgment but the Board is not notified of the settlement or judgment in a timely manner, the employer or third party who has been served with a Notice of Lien and notice of the amount of that lien already has notice of the existence and amount of the debt. Accordingly, interest should accrue from the date of settlement or judgment, but would be waived if paid within 30 days in accordance with §200.7(g)(1) of the Board's regulations.</textblock>
    <textblock>Likewise, a section 12(o) debt should be considered delinquent if the lien is not satisfied within 30 days after settlement or entry of judgment.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consequently, the Board proposes to amend §200.7 of its regulations to provide for the accrual of interest on section 12(o) debts and for the accrual of penalties on such debts when they become delinquent.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Board has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action for purposes of Executive Order 12866; therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required. There are no information collections associated with this rule.</textblock>
