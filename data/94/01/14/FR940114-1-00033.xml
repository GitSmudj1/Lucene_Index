    <textblock>Establish victim assistance and victim restitution programs and require the use of a victim impact statement prior to sentencing in all Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) cases where death or serious injury occurred.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Public Information and Education for Deterrence</textblock>
    <textblock>States should implement public information and education (PI&amp;E) programs to maximize public perception of the risks of being caught and punished for impaired driving. Public information programs should be:</textblock>
    <textblock>Comprehensive;</textblock>
    <textblock>Seasonally focused; and</textblock>
    <textblock>Sustained.</textblock>
    <textblock>C. Enforcement</textblock>
    <textblock>States should implement comprehensive enforcement programs to maximize the likelihood of detecting, investigating, arresting, and convicting impaired drivers. These programs should:</textblock>
    <textblock>Secure a commitment to rigorous DWI enforcement from the top levels of police management and State and local government;</textblock>
    <textblock>Provide state-of-the-art training for police officers, including Standardized Field Sobriety Testing (SFST) and Drug Evaluation and Classification (DEC);</textblock>
    <textblock>Provide adequate equipment and facilities, including preliminary and evidentiary breath test equipment;</textblock>
    <textblock>Deploy patrol resources effectively, using cooperative efforts of various State and local police agencies as appropriate;</textblock>
    <textblock>Maximize the likelihood of violator-officer contact;</textblock>
    <textblock>Make regular use of sobriety checkpoints;</textblock>
    <textblock>Facilitate the arrest process;</textblock>
    <textblock>Implement state-of-the-art post-arrest investigation of apprehended impaired drivers;</textblock>
    <textblock>Emphasize enforcement of youth impaired driving and drinking age laws; and</textblock>
    <textblock>Emphasize enforcement of laws regulating alcohol or drug impairment by CMV drivers.</textblock>
    <textblock>D. Prosecution</textblock>
    <textblock>States should implement a comprehensive program for visible and aggressive prosecution of impaired driving cases. These programs should:</textblock>
    <textblock>Give DWI cases high priority for prosecution;</textblock>
    <textblock>Provide sufficient resources to prosecute cases presented by law enforcement efforts;</textblock>
    <textblock>Facilitate uniformity and consistency in prosecution of impaired driving cases;</textblock>
    <textblock>Provide training for prosecutors so they can obtain high rates of conviction and seek appropriate sanctions for offenders;</textblock>
    <textblock>Prohibit plea bargaining in DWI cases, through appropriate legislation;</textblock>
    <textblock>Encourage vigorous prosecution of alcohol-related fatality and injury cases under both DWI and general criminal statutes; and</textblock>
    <textblock>Ensure that prosecutors are knowledgeable and prepared to prosecute youthful offenders appropriately.</textblock>
    <textblock>E. Adjudication</textblock>
    <textblock>The effectiveness of prosecution and enforcement efforts is lost without support and strength in adjudication. States should implement a comprehensive impaired driving adjudication program to:</textblock>
    <textblock>Provide sufficient resources to adjudicate cases and manage the dockets brought before them;</textblock>
    <textblock>Facilitate uniformity and consistency in adjudication of impaired driving cases;</textblock>
    <textblock>Give judges the skills necessary to appropriately adjudicate impaired driving cases;</textblock>
    <textblock>Provide similar training to administrative hearing officers who hear administrative license revocation appeals;</textblock>
