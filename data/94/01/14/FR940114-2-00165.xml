    <textblock>The procedures used to calculate a higher turbidity limit are the</textblock>
    <textblock>same as those used in the placer mining permits issued since</textblock>
    <textblock>1986. The turbidity limit is based on utilizing a mass balance</textblock>
    <textblock>equation which relates upstream receiving water flow and</textblock>
    <textblock>turbidity to effluent flow and turbidity. The basic form of this</textblock>
    <textblock>equation is:</textblock>
    <textblock>Q</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>C</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>+Q</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>C</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>=Q</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>C</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>,</textblock>
    <textblock>where</textblock>
    <textblock>C</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>= upstream turbidity;</textblock>
    <textblock>C</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>= effluent turbidity;</textblock>
    <textblock>C</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>= downstream turbidity after mixing where the allowable increase is 5 NTU above background (C</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>+5 NTU);</textblock>
    <textblock>Q</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>= stream flow downstream from any diversion and upstream from the discharge;</textblock>
    <textblock>Q</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>= effluent flow*; and,</textblock>
    <textblock>Q</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>= total stream flow downstream from discharge after complete mixing.</textblock>
    <textblock>*A default value of 10 gallons per minute (GPM) will be</textblock>
    <textblock>used if the NOI states that zero discharge will be achieved.</textblock>
    <textblock>The information that must be submitted by the permittee to</textblock>
    <textblock>determine the appropriate turbidity limit for the facility is the</textblock>
    <textblock>effluent and receiving stream flow rates. The receiving stream</textblock>
    <textblock>flow rate must be measured upstream from the discharge point</textblock>
    <textblock>and downstream from any diversions. Receiving stream flow</textblock>
    <textblock>values can be obtained from the ADNR, Division of Mining, upon</textblock>
    <textblock>request by the permittee. ADNR methodology for determining</textblock>
    <textblock>upstream flow uses equations developed by Ashton and Carlson</textblock>
    <textblock>(1984). The maximum effluent discharge flow must be estimated</textblock>
    <textblock>by the permittee and must account for the effects of all excess</textblock>
    <textblock>incidental waters.</textblock>
    <textblock>Permittees requesting a higher turbidity limitation must submit the</textblock>
    <textblock>necessary information to EPA with the NOI. This applies to all</textblock>
    <textblock>permittees, including those who have submitted this type of</textblock>
    <textblock>information in the past, in order to assure that all site-specific</textblock>
    <textblock>information is up-to-date.</textblock>

    <textblock>Suction Dredging.</textblock>
    <textblock>The daily visual inspection during operation of an area</textblock>
    <textblock>downstream of the suction dredge is based on research</textblock>
    <textblock>published in the scientific literature (Griffith and Andrews 1981,</textblock>
    <textblock>Hassler et al. 1986, Harvey 1986, Huber and Blanchet 1992,</textblock>
    <textblock>Thomas 1985) and on monitoring done by Alaska Department of</textblock>
    <textblock>Environmental Conservation (ADEC) (Ron McAlister, ADEC,</textblock>
    <textblock>personal communication). In most cases, water quality</textblock>
    <textblock>recovered rapidly below the dredge. ADEC found that turbidity</textblock>
    <textblock>was elevated 1 to 4.5 NTU 500 feet downstream of an operating</textblock>
    <textblock>10 inch dredge. The daily visual inspection during operation</textblock>
    <textblock>should assure that the water quality standard for turbidity is met.</textblock>

    <textblock>Arsenic_Mechanical and Hydraulic Removal of Overburden.</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA has concluded, based on available sampling data, that arsenic is</textblock>
    <textblock>commonly associated with placer mining wastes. Locally, it is the most</textblock>
    <textblock>abundant toxic metal present. For this reason, EPA has determined</textblock>
    <textblock>that arsenic is a pollutant of concern. Additionally, although several studies by EPA have indicated a reduction in levels of arsenic in placer mining effluent as a result of reducing settleable solids to 0.2 ml/l, EPA has concluded that these reduced levels of arsenic are not consistently adequate to achieve</textblock>
