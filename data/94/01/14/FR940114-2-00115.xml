    <textblock>Publication of this Notice of Realty Action (NORA) terminates and replaces the NORA published under serial number UTU-65199 on November 23, 1992, in Vol. 57, No. 220, Pages 53927 &amp; 53928 of the</textblock>

    <textblock>The purpose of the land exchange is to acquire private land located in the Book Cliffs region of southeastern Uintah County, Utah in exchange for public land. The offered private land, known locally as the Cripple Cowboy Ranch, is needed to consolidate public land ownership within the Book Cliffs. Acquisition of the offered ranch property will enhance resource management objectives to preserve crucial Rocky Mountain elk calving areas; protect habitat for mule deer, black bear, and other wildlife species; improve and protect riparian habitat; enhance native fisheries and provide for public access and recreational opportunities for future generations in the Book Cliffs region.</textblock>
    <textblock>The public land will be used to equalize land values for the offered private lands within the Book Cliffs pursuant to the exchange agreement between RMEF and BLM. The exchange would proceed until such time as the values of the public and private lands reach full equalization.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition to acquiring part of the Cripple Cowboy Ranch via land exchange, riparian lands and associated water rights for portions of the offered ranch property may be removed from the above described pool of private lands to allow direct purchase by the United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>Disposal of the selected public lands would be subject to the following reservations and third party rights:</textblock>
