    <textblock>A copy of the State plan supplement on the Puerto Rico VPP may be inspected and copied during normal business hours at the following locations: U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Office of the Regional Administrator, 201 Varick Street, room 670, New York, New York 10014; Puerto Rico Department of Labor and Human Resources, Prudencio Rivera Martinez Building, 505 Munoz Rivera Avenue, Hato Rey, Puerto Rico 00918.</textblock>
    <textblock>Copies of the Utah, Arizona and Puerto Rico supplements also are available at the U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Directorate of Federal-State Operations, 200 Constitution Avenue, NW., room N3700, Washington, DC 20210.</textblock>
    <textblock>D. Public Participation</textblock>
    <textblock>Under 29 CFR 1953.2(c) of this chapter, the Assistant Secretary may prescribe alternative procedures to expedite the review process or for any other good cause which may be consistent with applicable law. The Assistant Secretary finds that Utah's, Arizona's and Puerto Rico's Voluntary Protection Programs are generally identical to the Federal Voluntary Protection Programs, meet Federal requirements and were adopted by the States in accordance with State procedural requirements. Good cause is therefore found for approval of these supplements and further public participation would be unnecessary.</textblock>
    <textblock>E. Decision</textblock>
    <textblock>After careful consideration and review by the Regional and National Offices, the Utah, Arizona and Puerto Rico plan supplements described above are found to meet OSHA requirements and are hereby approved under part 1953 of this chapter. The decision incorporates the requirements of the Act and implementing regulations applicable to State plans generally.</textblock>
