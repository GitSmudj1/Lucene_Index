    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Railroad Retirement Board (Board) proposes to amend its regulations establishing fees to be assessed in connection with the search for records and provision of documents by the Board. The proposed rule increases some of the fees based on updates of estimates of direct costs to the Board of providing these services and adds a fee for transmittal of documents by other than regular mail.</textblock>

    <textblock>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</textblock>
    <textblock>Michael C. Litt, Bureau of Law, Railroad Retirement Board, 844 Rush Street, Chicago, Illinois 60611, (312) 751-4929, TDD (312) 751-4701.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Title 5 U.S.C. 552(a) requires the promulgation of a regulation specifying the schedule of fees applicable to the processing of requests for information. These fees are to provide for the recovery of the direct costs of search, duplication, and review. The fees currently provided for in §200.4(g)(1) no longer reflect the actual costs of processing requests for information and do not include fees for specific methods of transmittal of documents. Consequently, the Board proposes to increase these fees presently found in §200.4(g) and to add a new paragraph to provide a charge for transmittal of documents by other than regular post.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Board has determined that this is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291. Therefore, no regulatory impact analysis is required. There are no information collections associated with this proposed rule within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.</textblock>
    <textblock>List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 200</textblock>
