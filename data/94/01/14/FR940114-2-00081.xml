    <textblock>The HHS' National Toxicology Program announces the availability of the NTP Technical Report on the toxicology and carcinogenesis studies of o-nitroanisole which is used as an intermediate for the preparation of o-anisidine and in the manufacture of azo dyes.</textblock>
    <textblock>Toxicology and carcinogenicity studies were conducted by feeding groups of 60 F344 rats of each sex diets containing 0, 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole and groups of 60 B6C3F1 mice of each sex diets containing 0, 666, 2,000, or 6,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 103 weeks. In a companion study, male and female rats were fed 0, 6,000, or 18,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 6 months and maintained on untreated feed for 11/2 years.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the conditions of these feed studies there was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity1 of o-nitroanisole in male and female F344 rats that received diets containing 6,000 to 18,000 ppm for 6 months based on overall increased incidences of benign and malignant neoplasms of the urinary bladder, transitional cell neoplasms of the kidney, and benign and malignant neoplasms of the large intestine. There was a chemical-related increased incidence of mononuclear cell leukemia in male and female rats receiving diets containing 222, 666, or 2,000 ppm o-nitroanisole for 2 years. Marginally increased incidences of uncommon renal tubule neoplasms in male rats and forestomach neoplasms in male and female rats were considered uncertain findings. There was clear evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in male B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of benign and malignant hepatocellular neoplasms. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of o-nitroanisole in female B6C3F1 mice based on increased incidences of hepatocellular adenomas.</textblock>
    <textblock>Increased severity of nephropathy in male rats, and increased incidences of focal hyperplasia of the renal tubule epithelium and forestomach ulcers in male rats, and of transitional cell hyperplasia of the urinary bladder, focal hyperplasia of the forestomach, and hyperplasia of transitional epithelium of the kidney pelvis in male and female rats were associated with exposure to o-nitroanisole.</textblock>
