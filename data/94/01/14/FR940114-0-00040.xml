    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission is adopting modifications to the Annual Performance Report, Form OCP-101 (OCP-101), which sets forth requirements that relate to carrier performance information given to prospective individual shippers of household goods. This proceeding was instituted to address concerns expressed by consumer groups and the moving industry regarding the quality and reliability of the information provided by household goods carriers in the OCP-101. The modified OCP-101 requires objective disclosure by carriers of their performance to prospective shippers and verification of accuracy of the data contained in the reports.</textblock>

    <textblock>EFFECTIVE DATE:</textblock>
    <textblock>The revised rules are effective February 13, 1994.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Currently, the Commission's rules require household goods common carriers that transport 100 or more shipments to individual shippers, as defined in the Commission's rules, to provide information annually to the Commission about their previous year's performance by filing an</textblock>
    <textblock>Annual Performance Report</textblock>
    <textblock>(Form OCP-101). Under the new rules adopted in this decision,</textblock>
    <textblock>all</textblock>
    <textblock>household goods common carriers will be required to file the OCP-101 annually. However, only carriers that deliver 100 or more individual C.O.D. shipments will be required to complete the major portion of the form (Part B) and provide copies of it to prospective shippers. Part B of the OCP-101 shows a carrier's performance in the areas of estimating, on-time performance, and claims handling in a calendar year for C.O.D. shippers only. The OCP-101 must be filed with the Commission's Office of Compliance and Consumer Assistance by March 31 of the following calendar year.</textblock>
    <textblock>A notice of proposed rulemaking was published on February 3, 1993, at 58 FR 6912. Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision. To obtain a copy of the full decision, write to, call, or pick up in person from Dynamic Concepts, Inc., room 2229, Interstate Commerce Commission Building, Washington, DC 20423. Telephone: (202) 289-4357/4359. [Assistance for the hearing impaired is available through TDD services (202) 927-5721.]</textblock>
    <textblock>Energy and Environmental Consideration</textblock>
    <textblock>We conclude that modification of the regulations governing Form OCP-101 will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), we conclude that our action in this proceeding will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. We are modifying the OCP-101 requirements that relate to a carrier's performance information given to prospective individual shippers of household goods by motor common carriers of household goods transporting 100 or more C.O.D. individual-type shipments. The modified form will require verification of the data in the report by a company official. The regulations will have some impact on the administrative costs of preparing and duplicating the OCP-101 for smaller carriers (</textblock>
    <textblock>i.e.,</textblock>
    <textblock>Class II and III carriers) of household goods. The information required for completing that form is the type of information already kept by such entities and the time required to compile the data for that form should be minimal and vary proportionately with the number of shipments transported by the carrier. Although transportation consumers should benefit from the availability of this information, the cost to small carriers should be relatively minimal. Accordingly, it is unlikely that the economic impact on these small entities will be significant within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</textblock>
