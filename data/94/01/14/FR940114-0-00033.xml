    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This order partially revokes a Secretarial order insofar as it affects 35 acres of public lands withdrawn for the Bureau of Reclamation's Yellowstone Project. The lands are no longer needed for reclamation purposes, and the revocation is needed to permit disposal of the lands through competitive sale under section 203 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976. This action will open the land to surface entry. The minerals are held in trust for the Crow Tribe by the United States under the Act of August 14, 1958 (Pub. L. 85-628, 72 Stat. 575). The lands have been and remain open to mineral leasing.</textblock>
