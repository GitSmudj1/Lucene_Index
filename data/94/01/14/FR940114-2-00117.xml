    <textblock>Notice; correction of park boundary.</textblock>
    <textblock>Public Law 94-235 established Chickasaw National Recreation Area on March 17, 1976. The legislation specified that the total acreage of the recreation area may not exceed 10,000 acres. On December 9, 1991, a notice of a change in the boundary was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>, Vol. 56, No. 236, page 64272. This notice revised the boundaries of the area as depicted on a map entitled ``Boundary Map, Chickasaw National Recreation Area,'' Drawing No. 107/80027, dated April 1991.</textblock>
    <textblock>During the process of transferring jurisdiction from the Bureau of Reclamation to the National Park Service in accordance with the 1965 Memorandum of Agreement, three errors were made in mapping the original boundary and these errors were perpetuated in subsequent mapping. The three areas requiring correction are described as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Boundary Area ``A'' is located in the NW1/4 of section 6, Township 1 South, Range 3 East, Indian Meridian, Murray County, Oklahoma. The original boundary is revised so as to exclude 41.16 acres which were never acquired by the Bureau of Reclamation from H.H. Thomas or C.W. Purtle. This parcel was never intended to be a part of the Arbuckle Reservoir Project according to the Memorandum of Agreement and the deed records for the project.</textblock>
    <textblock>Boundary Area''B-1'' is located in the NE1/4 of section 6, Township 1 South, Range 3 East, Indian Meridian, Murray County, Oklahoma. The original boundary is revised so as to delete 10.10 acres that were conveyed to Glenn Haines by the United States of America, as recorded on May 27, 1966, in Book 159, page 619, of the deed records of Murray County, Oklahoma.</textblock>
    <textblock>Boundary Area ``B-2'' is located in the NE1/4 of section 6, Township 1 South, Range 3 East, Indian Meridian, Murray County, Oklahoma. The original boundary is revised so as to include 10.00 acres that were conveyed to the United States of America by Glenn Haines and Janetta Haines, as recorded on May 27, 1966, in Book 159, page 617, of the deed records of Murray County, Oklahoma.</textblock>
    <textblock>In summary, one change will add 10.00 acres and 2 changes will delete 51.26 acres, creating a net decrease of 41.26 acres. With these corrections made to the recreation area boundary, the current total acreage is 9,888.83. The authority for implementing this action is Public Law 94-235 (90 Stat. 235.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, notice is hereby given that the boundary of Chickasaw National Recreation Area should be revised as described above and delineated on a map entitled ``Boundary Map, Chickasaw National Recreation Area,'' numbered 107/80,030 and dated January 1993. This map is on file and available for inspection in the Office of the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, the Office of the Southwest Region, National Park Service, and the Office of the Superintendent, Chickasaw National Recreation Area.</textblock>
