Box 760, and Pennsylvania &amp; Southern Gas Company (PSGC), 102 Desmond Street, Sayre, Pennsylvania 18840, filed in Docket No. CP94-156-000 a joint application requesting a certificate pursuant to Section 7(c) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) permitting NUI to acquire and operate the jurisdictional facilities of PSGC, abandonment authorization pursuant to Section 7(b) for PSGC regarding the same facilities, and a service area determination for NUI pursuant to Section 7(f) of the NGA, all as more fully set forth in the application on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.</textblock>
