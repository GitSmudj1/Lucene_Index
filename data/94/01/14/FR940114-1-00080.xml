    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations</textblock>
    <textblock>governing the Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) Program. The</textblock>
    <textblock>FFEL Program consists of the Federal Stafford, Federal</textblock>
    <textblock>Supplemental Loans for Students (SLS), Federal PLUS, and the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Consolidation Loan programs. These amendments are needed</textblock>
    <textblock>to implement changes made to the Higher Education Act of 1965, as</textblock>
    <textblock>amended (HEA), by the Higher Education Amendments of 1992. The</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed regulations would amend the FFEL Program loan</textblock>
    <textblock>cancellation provisions and enhance the ability of lenders and</textblock>
    <textblock>guaranty agencies to service and collect FFEL Program loans.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary is proposing to revise 34 CFR part 682 to</textblock>
    <textblock>implement changes made to the HEA by the Higher Education</textblock>
    <textblock>Amendments of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-325), enacted July 23, 1992, as</textblock>
    <textblock>well as certain changes added by Public Law 103-208, enacted</textblock>
    <textblock>December 20, 1993. These regulations seek to improve the</textblock>
    <textblock>efficiency of federal student aid programs, and, by so doing, to</textblock>
    <textblock>improve their capacity to enhance opportunities for postsecondary</textblock>
    <textblock>education.</textblock>
    <textblock>Summary of Comments From Regional Meetings</textblock>
    <textblock>In compliance with section 492(a) of the HEA, the Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>convened regional meetings during September 1992 to obtain public</textblock>
    <textblock>involvement in the development of proposed regulations. The</textblock>
    <textblock>purpose of the meetings was to ``provide for a comprehensive</textblock>
    <textblock>discussion and exchange of information concerning the</textblock>
    <textblock>implementation'' of certain parts of Public Law 102-325. In</textblock>
    <textblock>addition, attendees at the regional meetings were asked to</textblock>
    <textblock>nominate individuals to act as negotiators in the negotiated</textblock>
    <textblock>rulemaking process required by section 492(b) of the HEA.</textblock>
    <textblock>The regional meetings were conducted for two days each in</textblock>
    <textblock>San Francisco, California; New York, New York; Atlanta, Georgia;</textblock>
    <textblock>and Kansas City, Missouri. Each participant at the regional</textblock>
    <textblock>meetings was assigned to one of six groups which were asked to</textblock>
    <textblock>discuss particular issue areas identified by the Department.</textblock>
    <textblock>Each group at the regional meetings prepared a report of its</textblock>
    <textblock>discussion and recommendations and those reports were presented</textblock>
    <textblock>to the Department for consideration during the preparation of the</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed regulations.</textblock>
    <textblock>The issues addressed in this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</textblock>
    <textblock>were discussed by one of the groups at each regional meeting.</textblock>
    <textblock>The specific recommendations made at those meetings are addressed</textblock>
    <textblock>below. The Secretary considered these comments in preparing</textblock>
    <textblock>draft proposed regulations.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Loan Discharge for Borrowers Attending Schools That</textblock>
    <textblock>Close</textblock>
    <textblock>Public Law 102-325 added section 437(c) to the HEA to provide</textblock>
    <textblock>that loans will be canceled for student borrowers who are unable</textblock>
    <textblock>to complete their program of study because the school closed.</textblock>
    <textblock>The specific issues described below were discussed in connection</textblock>
    <textblock>with this section.</textblock>
