    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The environmental assessment of this federally assisted action indicates that the project will not cause significant local, regional, or national impacts on the environment. As a result of these findings, L. Pete Heard, State Conservationist, has determined that the preparation and review of an environmental impact statement are not needed for this project.</textblock>
    <textblock>The project purposes are to reduce damage to agricultural land and public utilities, reduce downstream damages due to sedimentation, reduce land loss from channel instability and to reduce flooding of crop fields. The planned works of improvement include one hundred sixteen minor grade control (pipe) structures, eight road culvert stabilization (rock) sites, five major grade control structures, ten thousand linear feet of stream bank stabilization, approximately 4.7 miles of channel restoration and accelerated technical assistance for land treatment.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Notice of a Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) has been forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency and to various Federal, State, and local agencies and interested parties. A limited number of copies of the FONSI are available to fill single copy requests at the above address. Basic data developed during the environmental assessment are on file and may be reviewed by contacting L. Pete Heard.</textblock>
    <textblock>No administrative action on implementation of the proposal will be taken until 30 days after the date of this publication in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>(This activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.904, Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention, and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.)</textblock>
