  </action>
  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed general permit is intended to regulate placer mining activities in the state of Alaska. EPA, Region 10 has issued almost identical individual permits to these facilities in the past and intends to relieve some of the administrative burden of issuing individual permits by issuing this general permit. When issued, the proposed permit will establish effluent limitations, standards, prohibitions and other conditions on discharges from the covered facilities. These conditions are based on existing national effluent guidelines and material contained in the administrative record. A description of the basis for the conditions and requirements of the proposed general permit is given in the fact sheet published below.</textblock>
