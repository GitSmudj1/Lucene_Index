    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>On January 19, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior approved Oklahoma's program under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA) (see 46 FR 4902). On November 12, 1993, OSM notified the Governor of Oklahoma that it had reason to believe that serious problems exist that are adversely affecting the effective implementation, administration, maintenance and enforcement of Oklahoma's approved regulatory program (see</textblock>
    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</textblock>
    <textblock>below).</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the provisions of OSM's regulations at 30 CFR 733.12(c), OSM will hold an informal conference to discuss the facts surrounding such a notification if an informal conference is requested by the State. By letter dated December 22, 1993, the Oklahoma Department of Mines (ODM) requested an informal conference. Accordingly, OSM hereby notifies Oklahoma and the public that it will hold an informal conference. All interested persons may attend the informal conference.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On January 19, 1981, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Oklahoma program (46 FR 4902-4911).</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 12, 1993, OSM notified the Governor of Oklahoma that it had reason to believe that serious problems exist that are adversely affecting the effective implementation, administration, maintenance, and enforcement of Oklahoma's approved permanent regulatory program under SMCRA (OK-945).</textblock>
    <textblock>Since the approval of Oklahoma's program, and in keeping with its policy of working closely with the State, OSM has had numerous discussions with ODM officials about the State's performance. Recent discussions and investigations have centered on inadequacies of ODM's implementation of the approved program in the areas set forth below.</textblock>
    <textblock>1.</textblock>
    <textblock>Citing Violations:</textblock>
    <textblock>ODM has not cited all violations as the State program requires.</textblock>
    <textblock>2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Unreasonable Extensions of Abatement of Violations:</textblock>
    <textblock>Failure to abate cessation orders have not been issued in cases where such would have been appropriate. Instead, ODM has repeatedly extended abatement periods of violations. Contrary to the approved program, ODM has routinely extended the period for abatement of violations cited in NOV's beyond 90 days without compelling reasons.</textblock>
    <textblock>3.</textblock>
    <textblock>Civil Penalty Reductions:</textblock>
    <textblock>After appropriate initial assessments, ODM has frequently reduced penalties without appropriate justification when those penalties were challenged in assessment conferences and settlement agreements.</textblock>
    <textblock>4.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicant Violator System Not Updated:</textblock>
    <textblock>ODM has not properly updated the applicant violator system, which negates the use of the system to block approval of permits and revisions for entities that have outstanding violations.</textblock>
    <textblock>5.</textblock>
    <textblock>Reclamation and Bonding Failure:</textblock>
    <textblock>ODM has allowed mine operators to create a disturbed area that is larger than the acreage specified in the approved mine plan, thereby leading to inadequate bond.</textblock>
    <textblock>6.</textblock>
    <textblock>Permit Defects:</textblock>
    <textblock>ODM has approved permits and permit revisions that allow practices that do not comply with the Oklahoma program.</textblock>
    <textblock>7.</textblock>
    <textblock>Failure to Enact Program Amendments:</textblock>
    <textblock>Oklahoma has failed to promulgate rules approved in amendments to the Oklahoma program that were required for the program to be no less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective than the Federal regulations.</textblock>
    <textblock>8.</textblock>
    <textblock>Inadequate Allowance for Public Participation:</textblock>
    <textblock>ODM has not maintained or made available inspection and enforcement files in the county of the mining as required by the State program. ODM has not thoroughly investigated and acted on citizen's comments on permitting actions. ODM discouraged public participation through an improper decision that awarded attorney's fees to a mine operator.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the November 12, 1993, notification, OSM specified a date for ODM to present a plan to correct the deficiencies in the implementation of its program.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 733.12(c) of 30 CFR requires OSM to provide the State regulatory authority an opportunity for an informal conference. On December 22, 1993, the Chief Counsel of ODM requested that OSM hold such an informal conference. (OK-945.02)</textblock>
    <textblock>The informal conference may pertain to the facts of the deficiencies or the time period for accomplishing remedial actions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Conference Rules: The informal conference is an opportunity for OSM to discuss the status of the implementation of Oklahoma's program with Oklahoma officials.</textblock>
    <textblock>No testimony from the public will be taken but a verbatim transcript of the meeting will be kept.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dated: January 10, 1994.</textblock>
