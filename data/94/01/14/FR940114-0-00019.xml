    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Benefits under the Railroad Retirement Act (RRA) are financed by an employment tax imposed under the Railroad Retirement Tax Act (RRTA) upon wages paid by railroad employers. The tax has two components, a tier I level and a tier II level. The tier I level is the same as the tax imposed by the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and is used to finance what are the equivalent of social security benefits payable under the RRA. The amount of compensation subject to tax is based upon the contribution and benefit base as defined in section 230 of the Social Security Act (see 26 U.S.C. 3231(e)(2)(B)). The contribution base generally rises each year to reflect increases in the national wage rate. In order to estimate future revenues the Board has required employers to report gross earnings, up to $300,000, of a one-percent sample of their employees (20 CFR 209.12). However, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 eliminated the wage cap base for the Hospital Insurance Program (Medicare) portion of the tier I tax. Consequently, the $300,000 cap is no longer adequate for making computations with respect to the financial interchange between the railroad retirement and social security/medicare trust funds. Railroad retirement beneficiaries are covered under Medicare by virtue of section 7(d) of the RRA.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consequently, the Board is amending its regulations to require employers to report gross wages, not just wages up to $300,000.</textblock>
    <textblock>In order for the amendment increasing the amount of reportable earnings to be effective with respect to the 1993 reports, due by March 1, 1994, the Board is publishing this rule as an interim final rule. However, the Board does invite comments on the change.</textblock>
    <textblock>The information collections associated with these amendments have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under Control Number 3220-0132.</textblock>
