    <textblock>Section 682.410␣Fiscal, Administrative, and Enforcement</textblock>
    <textblock>Requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>The administrative wage garnishment requirements are taken</textblock>
    <textblock>directly from the HEA.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed regulations provide an alternative to the</textblock>
    <textblock>prescribed collection requirements in §682.410(b) if a guaranty</textblock>
    <textblock>agency uses collection agencies and administrative wage</textblock>
    <textblock>garnishment. Through these regulations, the Secretary expects to</textblock>
    <textblock>maximize default collections by the Department of Education,</textblock>
    <textblock>guaranty agencies, and the Internal Revenue Service.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed regulations implement the national wage</textblock>
    <textblock>garnishment provision in section 488A of the HEA, under which</textblock>
    <textblock>guaranty agencies or the Secretary may garnish up to 10 percent</textblock>
    <textblock>of the wages of a borrower who has defaulted on an FFEL Program</textblock>
    <textblock>loan or who is not making required payments under a repayment</textblock>
    <textblock>agreement. Under the proposed regulations, at least 30 days</textblock>
    <textblock>before garnishment proceedings are initiated the borrower must be</textblock>
    <textblock>given written notice informing him or her of the nature and</textblock>
    <textblock>amount of the loan obligation to be collected, the intention of</textblock>
    <textblock>the guaranty agency to initiate proceedings to collect the debt</textblock>
    <textblock>through deductions from pay, and an explanation of the borrower's</textblock>
    <textblock>rights regarding the proposed action.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed regulations provide the borrower with an</textblock>
    <textblock>opportunity to inspect and copy records related to the debt,</textblock>
    <textblock>establish a new repayment agreement, and receive a hearing</textblock>
    <textblock>concerning the existence or amount of the debt and the terms of a</textblock>
    <textblock>repayment schedule. In addition, no withholding of a debtor's</textblock>
    <textblock>wages may occur in the case of an individual who has been</textblock>
    <textblock>involuntarily separated from employment until that individual has</textblock>
    <textblock>been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. These</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed regulations would replace current regulatory provisions</textblock>
    <textblock>that authorize wage garnishment by guaranty agencies in certain</textblock>
    <textblock>circumstances.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 488A of the HEA protects borrowers by prohibiting</textblock>
    <textblock>employers from taking disciplinary action against an individual</textblock>
    <textblock>based on the fact that the individual's wages are subject to</textblock>
    <textblock>garnishment. The statute permits a borrower to sue an employer</textblock>
    <textblock>who takes such an action, and authorizes the court to award</textblock>
    <textblock>attorneys' fees, punitive damages, back pay, reinstatement, or</textblock>
    <textblock>other remedies the court believes reasonably necessary.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 488A(a) of the HEA preempts state laws that might</textblock>
    <textblock>prohibit garnishment to collect student loan debts. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary particularly requests comments on whether there are</textblock>
    <textblock>other state laws that might frustrate the purpose of section 488A</textblock>
    <textblock>and should be preempted. The Secretary asks commenters to</textblock>
    <textblock>provide specific information on those laws.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 682.411␣Due Diligence by Lenders in the Collection of</textblock>
    <textblock>Guaranty Agency Loans</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed regulations implement the requirements of the</textblock>
    <textblock>HEA by requiring lenders to warn borrowers and endorsers about</textblock>
    <textblock>the possibility that their wages may be garnished by the guaranty</textblock>
    <textblock>agency if they default on their repayment obligations.</textblock>
