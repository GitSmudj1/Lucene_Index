    <textblock>On December 22, 1993, the Department issued an Affirmative Determination Regarding Application for Reconsideration for workers and former workers of the Plains Petroleum Operating Company, Southern District, in Midland, Texas. The notice will soon be published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>Investigation findings show that the company submitted corporate sales and production data instead of data for the Southern District of Plains Petroleum Operating Company in Midland, Texas.</textblock>
    <textblock>The new findings on reconsideration show that crude oil and natural gas sales and production decreased in the 12 month period ending in July 1993 compared to the same period in 1992.</textblock>
    <textblock>Other findings on reconsideration show substantial worker separations in 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>U.S. imports of crude oil and natural gas increased in 1992 compared to 1991 and in the first six months of 1993 compared to the same period in 1992.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department's survey showed major customers reducing their purchases of crude oil from the Midland facility and increasing their purchases of imported crude oil.</textblock>
    <textblock>Conclusion</textblock>
    <textblock>After careful consideration of the new facts obtained on reconsideration it is concluded that increased imports of articles like or directly competitive with the production of crude oil and natural gas in the Southern District of Plains Petroleum Operating Company in Midland, Texas contributed importantly to the total or partial separation of workers at the Plains Petroleum Operating Company. In accordance with the provisions of the Trade Act of 1974, I make the following revised determination:</textblock>
    <textblock>All workers of the Plains Petroleum Operating Company Southern District, in Midland, Texas who became totally or partially separated from employment on or after August 3, 1992 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistance under section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.</textblock>
    <textblock>Signed at Washington, DC., this 27th day of December 1993.</textblock>
