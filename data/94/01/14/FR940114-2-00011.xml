    <textblock>Other issues commonly associated with timber harvesting and road construction include: effects on water quality, cultural resources, soils, old growth, and visuals. This list may be verified, expanded, or modified based on public scoping for this proposal.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been initiated with regard to listed species.

A 45-day comment period will follow publication of a Notice of Availability of the draft EIS in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. The comments received will be analyzed and considered in preparation of a final EIS, which will be accompanied by a Record of Decision. The final EIS is expected to be filed in June, 1994.</textblock>

Because of these court rulings, it is very important that those interested in this proposed action participate by the close of the 45-day comment period so that substantive comments and objections are available to the Forest Service at a time when it can meaningfully consider them and respond to them in the final EIS.</textblock>
