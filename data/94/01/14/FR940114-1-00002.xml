    <textblock>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</textblock>
    <textblock>Dr. Charles N. Shaw, Director, Dairy Analysis Division, Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture, P.O. Box 2415, Washington, DC 20013-2415, on 202-720-7601.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 102 of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 provides that no State shall provide for (and no person shall collect, directly or indirectly) a greater allowance for the processing of milk (``make allowance'') than is permitted under a Federal program to establish a Grade A price for manufacturing butter, nonfat dry milk, or cheese.</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 1, 1993, a supplemental proposed rule was published to implement section 102. A supplemental proposed rule was deemed necessary because of (1) comments received on the original proposed rule published on June 19, 1992, and (2) regulations issued by the Agricultural Marketing Service concerning the pricing of milk used to produce nonfat dry milk after the publication of the original proposed rule for section 102. The supplemental proposed rule specified that all comments had to be received by January 31, 1994, in order to be assured of consideration.</textblock>
    <textblock>Requests have been received from interested parties who indicate that they need additional time to prepare an analysis of the supplemental proposed rule. Based upon our review of those requests, it has been determined that an additional 60 days will be allowed for comment. Accordingly, comments on the proposed rule must now be received by April 1, 1994, in order to be assured of consideration.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice is hereby given that the period of time for submitting comments on the supplemental proposed rule published on November 1, 1993 (58 FR 58299), and for submitting additional comments on the original proposed rule, published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on June 19, 1992 (57 FR 27371), is extended to April 1, 1994.</textblock>
