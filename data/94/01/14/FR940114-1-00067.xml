    <textblock>The requirement at FAR 19.702(a)(1) for submission of a subcontracting plan by only the apparently successful offeror does not apply to GSA negotiated solicitations when the contract is expected to exceed $500,000 ($1,000,000 for construction). Except for acquisitions of leasehold interests in real property using expedited procedures and those offering minimal subcontracting opportunities, negotiated solicitations shall require submission with the initial offer of a subcontracting plan in the format described in FAR 52.219-9 by all offerors that are not small business concerns. Where price is the basis for award, such as multiple award schedule contracts, the plan will be evaluated and negotiated along with price. In solicitations requiring technical and management proposals, the subcontracting plan will be included as an evaluation factor or subfactor and negotiated concurrently with the technical, management, and price proposals.</textblock>
