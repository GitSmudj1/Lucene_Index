    <textblock>The Warren &amp; Trumbull Railroad Co._Operation Exemption_Rail Line in Trumbull County, OH</textblock>
    <textblock>Warren &amp; Trumbull Railroad Company (WTRM), a noncarrier, has filed a notice of exemption to operate over 5.28 miles of rail line between milepost 89.10 at Deforest Junction, OH and milepost 94.38 at North Warren, OH, under a contract with the Mahoning Valley Economic Development Rail Corporation (EDRC). The parties intend to consummate the transaction on or soon after the effective date of the exemption.</textblock>
    <textblock>The subject line, currently owned by CSX Transportation, Inc. (CSXT), was approved for abandonment by the Commission in CSX Transportation, Inc._Abandonment_Between Deforest Junction and North Warren in Trumbull County, OH, Docket No. AB-55 (Sub-No. 449), (ICC served Feb. 12, 1993). EDRC, a quasi-public regional economic development entity, will purchase the line from CSXT prior to WTRM's commencement of rail carrier service. WTRM will operate over the line as a common carrier by rail serving shippers local to the line, and will interchange traffic with CSXT at Deforest Junction.</textblock>
    <textblock>The transaction is related to a notice of exemption concurrently filed in Summit View Corporation_Continuance in Control Exemption_The Warren &amp; Trumbull Railroad Company, Finance Docket No. 32439 wherein Summit View Corporation (Summit) seeks to continue in control of WTRM and three other class III railroads upon WTRM becoming a class III rail carrier.</textblock>

    <textblock>Any comments must be filed with the Commission and served on: Kelvin J. Dowd, Esq., Slover &amp; Loftus, 1224 Seventeenth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20036.</textblock>
    <textblock>This notice is filed under 49 CFR 1150.31. If the notice contains false or misleading information, the exemption is void</textblock>
    <textblock>ab initio.</textblock>
    <textblock>Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not automatically stay the transaction.</textblock>
    <textblock>Decided:</textblock>
    <textblock>January 7, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings.</textblock>
