    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The Act of December 31, 1975 (the ``Act''), established the Hells Canyon National Recreation Area (the ``HCNRA'') ``to assure that the natural beauty, and historical and archeological values of the Hells Canyon area *␣*␣* are preserved for this and future generations, and that the recreational and ecologic values and public enjoyment of the area are thereby enhanced.'' 89 Stat. 1117; 16 U.S.C. 460gg</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>While the Act's overall thrust is to protect and enhance the identified resource values within the HCNRA, Congress acknowledged in Section 13 of the Act that ``ranching, grazing, farming, timber harvesting, and the occupation of homes and lands associated therewith, as they exist on the date of enactment of this Act, are recognized as traditional and valid uses of the recreation area.''</textblock>
    <textblock>The HCNRA covers 658,457 acres. Almost 95% of the HCNRA, or 625,193 acres, is in federal ownership. Within the HCNRA is the Hells Canyon Wilderness, totalling 219,500 acres of National Forest System land, and a small section of the Eagle Cap Wilderness, totalling 3,553 acres of National Forest System land. Also within the HCNRA are the Snake, Rapid, and Imnaha Wild and Scenic Rivers, the corridors of which include 33,767 acres of National Forest System lands.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 7 of the Act stipulates that the HCNRA shall be administered for public outdoor recreation in a manner compatible with the following objectives:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The maintenance and protection of the free-flowing nature of the rivers within the recreation area;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Conservation of scenic, wilderness, cultural, scientific, and other values contributing to the public benefit;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Preservation, especially in the area generally known as Hells Canyon, of all features and peculiarities believed to be biologically unique including, but not limited to, rare and endemic plant species, rare combinations of aquatic, terrestrial, and atmospheric habitats, and the rare combinations of outstanding and diverse ecosystems and parts of ecosystems associated therewith;</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Protection and maintenance of fish and wildlife habitat;</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Protection of archeological and paleontological sites and interpretation of these sites for the public benefit and knowledge insofar as it is compatible with protection;</textblock>
    <textblock>(6) Preservation and restoration of historic sites associated with and typifying the economic and social history of the region and the American West; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(7) Such management, utilization, and disposal of natural resources on federally owned lands, including, but not limited to, timber harvesting by selective cutting, mining, and grazing and the continuation of such existing uses and developments as are compatible with the provisions of the Act.</textblock>
