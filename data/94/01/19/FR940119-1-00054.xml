    <textblock>2. In §285.2, the definition of fork length</textblock>
    <textblock>is removed and definitions of</textblock>
    <textblock>curved fork length</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>straight fork length</textblock>
    <textblock>are added, in alphabetical order, to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§285.2</textblock>
    <textblock>Definitions.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>Curved fork length</textblock>
    <textblock>means a measurement of the length of Atlantic bluefin tuna taken in a line tracing the contour of the body along the middle of the lateral surface from the tip of the snout to the fork of the tail.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>Straight fork length</textblock>
    <textblock>means a measurement of the length of Atlantic bluefin tuna taken in a straight line along the middle of the lateral surface from a line perpendicular to the tip of the snout to a line perpendicular to the fork of the tail.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Section 285.22 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§285.22</textblock>
    <textblock>Quotas.</textblock>
    <textblock>The total annual (January 1-December 31) amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed or landed by persons and vessels subject to U.S. jurisdiction in the regulatory area is subdivided as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>General.</textblock>
    <textblock>The total annual amount of large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed or landed in the regulatory area by vessels permitted in the General category under §285.21(b) is 531 mt, of which 65 mt is set aside for a late-season fishery beginning</textblock>
    <textblock>September 15. On the basis of the statistics referenced at</textblock>
    <textblock>§285.20(b)(1), the Assistant Administrator will project a date when the catch of Atlantic bluefin tuna will equal the annual quota minus 65 mt, and will publish notification in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>stating that fishing for, retaining, possessing or landing Atlantic bluefin tuna under the early-season quota must cease on that date at a specified hour, and not recommence until September 15, whereupon a quota equal to the difference between the annual quota and the estimated catch prior to September 15 will become available. If the Assistant Administrator determines (based on dealer reports, availability of large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna on the fishing grounds, and any other relevant information) that variations in seasonal distribution, abundance, or migration patterns of Atlantic bluefin tuna, and the catch rate, may prevent fishermen in an identified area from harvesting their share of the quota, the Assistant Administrator may set aside an allocation of the late-season quota for such area. The amount of any allocation shall not exceed the greater of 20 mt or the maximum reported landings in the identified area in any of the preceding 3 years. The Assistant Administrator will publish notification of any set-aside allocation and its basis in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. The daily catch limit for the identified area will be set at one large medium or giant Atlantic bluefin tuna per day per vessel.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Harpoon Boat.</textblock>
    <textblock>The total annual amount of large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed or landed in the regulatory area by vessels permitted in the Harpoon Boat category under §285.21(b) is 53 mt.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c)</textblock>
    <textblock>Purse Seine.</textblock>
    <textblock>The total annual amount of large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed or landed in the regulatory area by vessels permitted in the Purse Seine category under §285.21(b) is 301 mt.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d)</textblock>
    <textblock>Angling.</textblock>
    <textblock>The total annual amount of school, large school, and small medium Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed or landed in the regulatory area by anglers is 219 mt. No more than 99 mt of this quota may be school Atlantic bluefin tuna. This quota is further subdivided as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) 47 mt of school Atlantic bluefin tuna may be caught, retained, possessed or landed south of 38</textblock>
    <textblock>○47</textblock>
    <textblock>’ N. latitude.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) 52 mt of school Atlantic bluefin tuna may be caught, retained, possessed or landed north of 38</textblock>
    <textblock>○47</textblock>
    <textblock>’ N. latitude.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e)</textblock>
    <textblock>Incidental.</textblock>
    <textblock>The total annual amount of large medium and giant Atlantic bluefin tuna that may be caught, retained, possessed or landed in the regulatory area by vessels permitted in the Incidental Catch category under §285.21(b) is 113 mt. This quota is further subdivided as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) 109 mt for longline vessels. No more than 86 mt may be caught, retained, possessed, or landed in the area south of 34</textblock>
    <textblock>○00</textblock>
    <textblock>’ N. latitude.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) For vessels fishing under §285.23 (a) and (d), 4 mt may be caught, retained, possessed, or landed in the regulatory area.</textblock>
    <textblock>(f)</textblock>
    <textblock>Inseason adjustment amount.</textblock>
    <textblock>The total amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna that will be held in reserve for inseason adjustments is 18 mt. The Assistant Administrator may allocate any portion (from 0 to 100 percent) of this amount to any category or categories of the fishery, including research activities authorized under §285.1(c). The Assistant Administrator will publish a notification of allocation of any inseason adjustment amount in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>before such allocation is to become effective. Before making any such allocation, the Assistant Administrator will consider the following factors:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The usefulness of information obtained from catches of the particular category of the fishery for biological sampling and monitoring the status of the stock;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The catches of the particular gear segment to date and the likelihood of closure of that segment of the fishery if no allocation is made;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) The projected ability of the particular gear segment to harvest the additional amount of Atlantic bluefin tuna before the anticipated end of the fishing season; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) The estimated amounts by which quotas established for other gear segments of the fishery might be exceeded.</textblock>
