    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Pacific Fishery Management Council's (Council) Klamath River Fall Chinook Review Team (Team) will meet on February 3-4, 1994, in room 200 of the Stewart School building at 1125 16th Street, Arcata, CA. The meeting will begin on February 3 at 2 p.m. and on February 4 at 8 a.m. The meetings will not adjourn until the business for each day is completed and may go into the evening hours.</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of these meetings is to examine the causes which have led to a failure in meeting spawning escapement objectives for naturally produced Klamath River fall chinook. This stock has been below its floor spawning escapement level (35,000) for the past three years. The Team report will be reviewed by the Council at its March meeting in Portland, OR.</textblock>
