    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Applied Research and Technology Program, authorized under section 6005(a) of the ISTEA, Pub. L. 102-240, 105 Stat. 1914, 2170, was established for the purpose of accelerating testing, evaluation, and implementation of technologies which are designed to improve the durability, efficiency, environmental impact, productivity, and safety of highway, transit, and intermodal transportation systems.</textblock>
    <textblock>The attached guidelines were developed for the selection and funding of field Test and Evaluation (T&amp;E) projects under the ART Program which utilize the Highway Innovative Technology Evaluation Center (HITEC) for the development of evaluation plans. HITEC, an independent non-profit organization, was created by the American Society of Civil Engineer's (ASCE) Civil Engineering Research Foundation (CERF), in conjunction with the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and the FHWA. HITEC provides a process for the impartial evaluation of new products, materials, equipment, and services for which industry standards do not exist. Selection of T&amp;E projects for ART Program funding will be made by the FHWA on the basis of evaluation plans developed by HITEC.</textblock>
