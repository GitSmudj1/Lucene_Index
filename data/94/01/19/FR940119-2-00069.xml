    <textblock>Exemption</textblock>
    <textblock>I</textblock>
    <textblock>The Carolina Power &amp; Light Company (the licensee) is the holder of Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-71 and DPR-62 which authorize operation of the Brunswick Steam Electric Plant, Units 1 and 2 (BSEP or the facility), respectively, at steady state power levels not in excess of 2436 megawatts thermal. The facility consists of two boiling water reactors located at the licensee's site in Brunswick County, North Carolina. The Facility Operating License provides, among other things, that BSEP is subject to all rules, regulations and Orders of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) now and hereafter in effect.</textblock>
    <textblock>II</textblock>
    <textblock>Section III.A.5.(b)(2) of Appendix J establishes an acceptance criterion for the total measured containment leakage rate, L</textblock>
    <textblock>am</textblock>
    <textblock>, measured at the peak containment internal pressure, P</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>, calculated for the design basis accident. Since the periodic Type A tests at BSEP are conducted at P</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>, the acceptance criterion for these tests is that L</textblock>
    <textblock>am</textblock>
    <textblock>be less than 75 percent of the maximum allowable leakage rate, L</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>, as specified in Technical Specification 4.6.1.2.b; this value is 0.5 percent by weight of the containment air per 24 hours. Section III.A.6(b) of Appendix J requires that, if two consecutive periodic Type A tests fail to meet the criteria in section III.A.5.(b)(2), notwithstanding the periodic retest schedule of section III.D, a Type A test must be performed at each plant shutdown for refueling, or approximately every 18 months, whichever occurs first, until two consecutive Type A tests meet the criteria in section III.A.5.(b).</textblock>
    <textblock>The exemption would allow both BSEP units to return to a normal testing frequency so the next Unit 1 Type A test would then be performed during the Reload 9 outage scheduled for March 1995 and the next Unit 2 test during the Reload 12 outage scheduled for March 1997.</textblock>
    <textblock>In its letter dated October 19, 1993, requesting a one-time exemption from the schedular requirements of Section III.A.6.(b) of Appendix J, the licensee stated that each unit is currently in an accelerated testing condition due to as-found testing failures which, except for the 1987 Unit 1 test, were within L</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>leakage limits but exceeded the current 0.75 L</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>leakage limit of Section III.A.5.(b)(2) of Appendix J to 10 CFR Part 50. The licensee has based its request on the fact that the as-left limit of 0.75 L</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>was specified in Appendix J to provide a margin for possible deterioration of the containment leak-tightness during the interval between Type A tests. The licensee states that this margin for deterioration is no longer needed when the as-found Type A test is performed. The licensee believes that it should be technically acceptable to use L</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>as the as-found Type A test acceptance criterion. The license provides further justification in that the Type A test are normally terminated as soon as the acceptance criteria are satisfied for economic reasons. The licensee believes that this process may result in leak rates that may not be indicative of actual primary containment leakage and that, if the test durations were extended, the quantified leakage would be less than that reported to the NRC.</textblock>
    <textblock>The as-found Type A condition is represented by the leakage rate calculated by adding the differences between the as-found and as-left measured local leakage rates from each Type B and Type C test to the leakage rate measured in the Type A test. These Type B and Type C tests are usually conducted prior to conducting the Type A test. In the event that potentially excessive leakage paths are identified that would interfere with the satisfactory completion of a period Type A test and such paths are isolated during the test, the Type B or Type C as-found leakage rates measured on the isolated penetrations after the completion of the Type A test are added into the Type A as-found leakage rate total. The as-left Type A condition is represented by the periodic Type A leakage rate after any required repairs and/or adjustments are made.</textblock>
    <textblock>The staff reviewed the history of the Type A tests conducted at BSEP and found that the last two Type A as-found test results have been failures as noted below:</textblock>
    <textblock>The staff noted that the last two test results for each unit has exceeded the acceptance criterion of 0.75 L</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>required by Appendix J. Except for the 1987 test on Unit 1, the test results did not exceed the maximum allowable rate of 1.0 L</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>. The licensee indicated the 1987 Unit 1 failure was caused by a containment penetration failure identified during the local leak rate testing. The licensee also stated the primary reason for failing the as-found limits is considered to be the leakage savings additions from Type C testing of valves and the Type B testing of penetrations, where leakage rates of repaired or replaced components are added into the integrated Type A test results.</textblock>
    <textblock>The licensee stated the major contributors to the 1987 Unit 1 test failure were from (1) penetration X9A, Feedwater Loop A Injection, and (2) penetration X54E, Containment Monitor, CAC-AT-1262, Discharge. The licensee further stated the corrective actions to repair several valves associated with these penetrations were completed, and if the leakage from these penetrations was not considered, the as-found leakage savings would have been 0.049% wt. per day. For the 1991 Unit 1 Type A test, the majors contributors were stated to be (1) penetration X9B, Feedwater Loop B Injection, (2) penetration X14, Reactor Water Cleanup (RWCU) Suction Line, and (3) penetration X10, Reactor Core Isolation Cooling Turbine Steam Supply Line. These penetrations were repaired by the replacement or repair of affected valves.</textblock>
