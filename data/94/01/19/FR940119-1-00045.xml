    <textblock>Questions for the Nonregulated Public</textblock>
    <textblock>The preceding 17 questions relate to the gathering of pipeline system operational data which can be answered only by hazardous liquid pipeline operators. However, as stated earlier, the RSPA is also soliciting comments and ideas from the nonregulated public including State agencies, trade associations, and environmental organizations. The following 2 questions are directed to these members of the public.</textblock>
    <textblock>Question 18:</textblock>
    <textblock>The RSPA is attempting to determine which critical locations should be protected from hazardous liquid pipeline releases by the installation of EFRDs. From the locations listed below, please provide a ranking by probability with a ranking of ``1'' representing the location which poses the greatest probability of combined safety and environmental risk to the public. (Questions 18.10-18.12 are left blank for the commenter to specify locations of risk not listed in questions 18.1-18.9.)</textblock>
    <textblock>18.1␣Locations where valves are required to be placed by 49 CFR 195.260 (e) and (f) on hazardous liquid pipelines in order to protect water?</textblock>
    <textblock>16</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>18.2␣Locations where it would take more than two hours to reach and close a block valve once the location of a release is identified?</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>18.3␣Locations of possible ground movement including areas of: known seismic risk, slope instability, landslide, and mine subsidence?</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>18.4␣Schools?</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>18.5␣Hospitals?</textblock>

    <textblock>18.6␣Closely spaced individual dwellings (defined as areas similar to class 2 locations as defined in 49 CFR 192.5(c)?)</textblock>
    <textblock>17</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>18.7␣Shopping malls and similar locations?</textblock>

    <textblock>Question 19:</textblock>
    <textblock>From the locations listed below, please provide a ranking of consequences from a hazardous liquid pipeline release with a ranking of ``1'' representing the location that would result in the greatest combined public safety and environmental consequences from a release of hazardous liquid from a pipeline. (Questions 19.10-19.12 are left blank for the commenter to rank the benefits for the risk locations specify in questions 18.10-18.12.)</textblock>
    <textblock>19.1␣Locations where valves are required to be placed by 49 CFR 195.260 (e) and (f) on hazardous liquid pipelines in order to protect water?</textblock>
    <textblock>18</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>19.2␣Locations where it would take more than two hours to reach and close a block valve once the location of a release is identified?</textblock>
