    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This rulemaking implements provisions of the Mickey Leland Memorial Domestic Hunger Relief Act. The Act amends the timeframe for household election of a repayment method for intentional Program violation (IPV) claims, changes retention rates on food stamp recipient claims for State agencies and reduces the enhanced funding rate for the costs of planning, designing, developing and installing ADP and information retrieval systems. This rule also implements a provision of the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act Amendments of 1991, relating to household election of repayment method for inadvertent household error (IHE) claims. This rule also implements a change to ADP requirements which limits enhanced funding requests for automated systems to initial development of a ``complete'' system and corrects errors made in previously published regulations relating to recipient claims and enhanced ADP funding. In addition, this rule clarifies exceptions to requirements to provide notice of adverse action when an allotment is reduced to recoup a recipient claim and clarifies the Federal funding rate allowed for preparation of a Planning Advance Planning Document (PAPD). Finally, this rule gives State agencies, at their request, the option to make payment by check for FNS-209 amounts due FNS, and to have payments due from FNS to the State made by check in place of amending the States' letter of credit.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 13961 of the Omnibus Budget reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA), (Public Law 103-66), Signed August 10, 1993, reduces the federal reimbursement rate for development of automated data processing and information retrieval systems development to the standard 50 percent Federal reimbursement level effective April 1, 1994. During the last week of October 1993 and the first week of November 1993, the Department issued a memorandum which briefed States on the details of this change in the law. The memorandum will be followed by conforming regulations which will be effective April 1, 1994.</textblock>
