    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix D, part 91, lists airports/locations where special operating restrictions apply. Section 1 lists the locations at which the requirements of §91.215(b)(2) apply. (Aircraft operating within 30 nautical miles of an airport, listed in Section 1, from the surface upward to 10,000 feet mean sea level must be equipped with a Mode C transponder.) Section 3 lists the locations where fixed-wing special visual flight rule (SVFR) operations are prohibited. Both sections list the name of the Denver, Colorado, airport as ``Denver Stapleton Airport.''</textblock>
    <textblock>On March 9, 1994, the new Denver International Airport will open, replacing the Denver Stapleton Airport. This amendment replaces the word ``Stapleton'' with the word ``International'' in sections 1 and 3 of appendix D, part 91.</textblock>
