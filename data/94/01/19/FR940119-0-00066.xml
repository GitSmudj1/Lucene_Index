    <textblock>(2) Notify NMFS, via their VTS, prior to the vessel's first planned trip in the EEZ, that the vessel is to resume fishing under the vessel's DAS allocation.</textblock>

    <textblock>Vessel owners opting to request entry into the DAS exemption program via fax or phone shall:</textblock>

When providing notice, the exemption holder will specify that the request is for withdrawal from the program and provide the vessel name and permit number, and the name and phone number of the caller. The exemption holder may not leave port to fish for scallops in the EEZ until 48 hours after notification of early withdrawal is received by the Regional Director.</textblock>

    <textblock>(a) Annually, upon request from the Council, but at a minimum in the years 1996 and 1999, the Regional Director will provide the Council with information on the status of the sea scallop resource.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Within 60 days of receipt of that information, the Council's Plan Development Team (PDT) shall assess the condition of the Atlantic sea scallop resource to determine the adequacy of the total allowable DAS reduction schedule, described in §650.24(c), to achieve the target fishing mortality rate. In addition, the PDT shall make a determination whether other resource conservation issues exist that require a management response in order to meet the goals and objectives outlined in the FMP. The PDT shall report its findings and recommendations to the Council. In its report to the Council, the PDT shall provide the appropriate rationale and economic and biological analysis for its recommendation utilizing the most current catch, effort, and other relevant data from the fishery.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) After receiving the PDT findings and recommendations, the Council shall determine whether adjustments to, or additional, management measures are necessary to meet the goals and objectives of the FMP. After considering the PDT's findings and recommendations, or at any other time, if the Council determines that adjustments to, or additional, management measures are necessary, it shall develop and analyze appropriate management actions over the span of at least two Council meetings. The Council shall provide the public with advance notice of the availability of both the proposals and the analyses, and opportunity to comment on them prior to and at the second Council meeting. The Council's recommendation on adjustments or additions to management measures must come from one or more of the following categories:</textblock>
