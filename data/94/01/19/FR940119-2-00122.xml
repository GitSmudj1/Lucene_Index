    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>On January 6, 1994, the Departments of the Army, Agriculture, the Interior, and the Environmental Protection Agency signed a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) that recognizes the Soil Conservation Service (SCS) as the lead Federal agency for wetlands delineations on agricultural lands. Specifically, the MOA articulates the policy and procedures to be used in the determination of wetlands jurisdiction for purposes of both Section 404 of the Clean Water Act and Subtitle B of the Food Security Act (also known as the Swampbuster program). The MOA, which establishes minimum training requirements and requires the use of standard interagency approved methods, will improve the quality and consistency of wetlands determinations on agricultural lands. The actual text of the MOA is published as part of this notice.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On August 24, 1993, the Clinton Administration announced a comprehensive package of wetlands policy reforms that will improve the protection of wetlands and make wetlands programs more fair and flexible for landowners. The MOA signed on January 6, 1994, implements one of the more than 40 initiatives in the Administrations's Wetlands Plan. The MOA signatory agencies recognize the important contribution of agricultural producers to society, our economy, and our environment. The agencies are committed to ensuring that Federal wetlands programs are administered in a manner that minimizes the impacts on affected landowners to the extent possible consistent with the important goal of protecting wetlands. The MOA was developed in response to concerns that previous practices may have led to confusion and inconsistent application of Federal wetlands programs and policies on agricultural lands.</textblock>
