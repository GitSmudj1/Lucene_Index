    <textblock>Small dredge program restrictions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any vessel owner whose vessel is assigned to either the Part-time or Occasional category may request to be placed in one category higher on the annual vessel permit application as described under §650.4(e)(2)(iv). Vessel owners making such a request will be placed in the appropriate category, for the entire year, if they agree to comply with the following restrictions, in addition to and notwithstanding other restrictions of this part, when fishing under the DAS program described in §650.24, or are in possession of more than 400 lbs (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The vessel must fish exclusively with one dredge no more than 10.5 feet (3.2 m) in width;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The vessel is prohibited from having more than one dredge on board or in use; and,</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) The vessel may have no more than five people, including the operator, on board.</textblock>
    <textblock>§650.22</textblock>
    <textblock>Possession restrictions.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Owners or operators of vessels with a limited access scallop permit that have declared out of the DAS program as specified in §650.26, or have used up their DAS allocations and vessels possessing a general scallop permit, unless exempted under the DAS exemption program described under §650.27, are prohibited from possessing or landing per trip, more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops, or 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops, with not more than one scallop trip allowable in any calendar day.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Owners or operators of vessels without a Federal sea scallop permit, except vessels fishing for scallops exclusively in state waters, are prohibited from possessing or landing per trip, more than 40 pounds (18.14 kg) of shucked sea scallops, or 5 U.S. bushels (176.2 l) of in-shell sea scallops. Owners or operators of vessels without Federal scallop permits are prohibited from selling, bartering, or trading sea scallops harvested from Federal waters.</textblock>
    <textblock>§650.23</textblock>
    <textblock>Transfer-at-sea.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Owners or operators of vessels permitted under §650.4 are prohibited from transferring or attempting to transfer fish from one vessel to another vessel.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) All persons are prohibited from transferring or attempting to transfer sea scallops from one vessel to another vessel.</textblock>
    <textblock>§650.24</textblock>
    <textblock>Days-at-sea (DAS) allocations.</textblock>
    <textblock>Each vessel issued a limited access scallop permit shall be assigned to a DAS category based on evidence and criteria as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Limited access scallop permits will indicate which category the vessel is assigned to. Vessels are prohibited from fishing for, landing per trip, or possessing more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops once their allocated number of DAS, as specified under paragraph (c) of this section, are used up.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>Criteria for assigning DAS categories.</textblock>
    <textblock>All vessels qualifying for a limited access scallop permit under the criteria specified in §650.4(a) shall be assigned to the Full-time, Part-time, or Occasional DAS category based on the formulas specified in paragraph (b) of this section and the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Full-time.</textblock>
    <textblock>A vessel shall be assigned to the Full-time category if that vessel has averaged at least 150 days of directed scallop fishing annually according to the formulas specified in paragraph (b) of this section;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Part-time.</textblock>
    <textblock>A vessel shall be assigned to the Part-time category if that vessel has averaged more than 37 days but less than 150 days of directed scallop fishing annually according to the formulas specified in paragraph (b) of this section;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Occasional.</textblock>
    <textblock>A vessel shall be assigned to the Occasional category if that vessel has averaged 37 days or less of directed scallop fishing annually according to the formulas specified in paragraph (b) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>DAS formulas.</textblock>
    <textblock>A vessel's average number of days of directed scallop fishing for purposes of assigning the vessel to one of the categories specified in paragraph (a) of this section shall be determined by applying one of the following formulas to the data, information, or other credible evidence available to the Regional Director. Scallop DAS for this purpose is defined as the total days at sea on trips with landings of more than 400 pounds (181.44 kg) of shucked scallops or 50 U.S. bushels (17.62 hl) of in-shell scallops.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The following formulas apply to all vessels qualifying for limited access scallop permits, with the exception of vessels that qualify under paragraph §650.4(a)(1)(i)(C). The DAS formula applicable to that group of vessels is specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Vessel owners may choose their 1990 history under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section, or a calculation based on the 1985-1990 history, as applicable, under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. DAS are calculated from the formulas below and the result is applied to the DAS categories described in paragraph (a) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>1990 fishing history.</textblock>
    <textblock>For any vessel that fished for scallops in 1990, the number of scallop DAS may be determined by calculating the total number of DAS on scallop trips ending in 1990; or,</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii)</textblock>
    <textblock>1985-1990 fishing history.</textblock>
    <textblock>For vessels with history in the scallop fishery between 1985 and 1990, inclusive, the number of years history is determined as follows. With the exception of the adjustments specified under paragraphs (b)(1)(iii) and (b)(1)(iv) of this section, vessels whose calculated scallop history is based on a formula below must use their entire history in the scallop fishery and may not elect to use a formula based on fewer years history in the fishery.</textblock>
