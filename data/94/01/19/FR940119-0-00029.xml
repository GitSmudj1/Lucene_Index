    <textblock>V. Director's Decision</textblock>
    <textblock>Based on the above findings, the Director approves Colorado's program amendment as submitted on March 19, 1993, and revised on August 4, 1993. As discussed in finding Nos. III.1. through III.5., the Director has determined that Colorado's proposed regulations addressing backfilling and grading for the elimination of highwalls, and limited variances from AOC requirements are no less effective than the Federal regulations. The Director is approving the proposed rules with the provision that they be fully promulgated in identical form to the rules submitted to and reviewed by OSM and the public.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Federal regulations at 30 CFR part 906 codifying decisions concerning the Colorado program are being amended to implement this decision. This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the State program amendment process and to encourage States to bring their programs into conformity with the Federal standards without undue delay. Consistency of State and Federal standards is required by SMCRA.</textblock>
    <textblock>VI. Procedural Determinations</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Executive Order 12866</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review).</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Executive Order 12778</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. National Environmental Policy Act</textblock>
    <textblock>No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1292(d)) provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)).</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3507</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>).</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
