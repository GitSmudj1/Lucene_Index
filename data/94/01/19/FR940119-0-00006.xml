    <textblock>Another commenter pointed out that we do not require that the</textblock>
    <textblock>demand letter inform households when recoupment would begin and the</textblock>
    <textblock>amount of benefits the household would then receive. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Department believes that it would be useful to include this</textblock>
    <textblock>information in the demand letter. Current rules at 7 CFR</textblock>
    <textblock>273.18(g)(4) require that prior to reduction State agencies inform</textblock>
    <textblock>households about the effect of recoupment on their benefits.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consequently, the final rule provides that, unless the State agency</textblock>
    <textblock>has otherwise informed the household what its allotment would be</textblock>
    <textblock>net of the reduction for repaying the claim, it provide that</textblock>
    <textblock>information in the demand letter.</textblock>
    <textblock>Current rules at 7 CFR 273.12(c)(2) provide that decreases in</textblock>
    <textblock>benefits must be made effective no later than the month following</textblock>
    <textblock>the lapse of the adverse notice period. Consistent with this</textblock>
    <textblock>general policy and the required timeframe for election of a</textblock>
    <textblock>repayment method, the final rule provides that the initial demand</textblock>
    <textblock>letter for IHE claims must inform the household that the reduction</textblock>
    <textblock>will begin with the first allotment issued after the household</textblock>
    <textblock>either timely elects allotment reduction or, if it fails to make a</textblock>
    <textblock>timely election, with the first allotment issued after the</textblock>
    <textblock>expiration of the time for its election. Demand letters provided</textblock>
    <textblock>subsequent to a fair hearing sustaining an IHE claim must inform</textblock>
    <textblock>the household that if it fails to make a timely election, allotment</textblock>
    <textblock>reduction will begin with the first allotment issued after timely</textblock>
    <textblock>notice of such election is due to the State agency.</textblock>
    <textblock>Another commenter on this paragraph recommended that we be more</textblock>
    <textblock>specific about the acceptable ways for households to communicate</textblock>
    <textblock>their decisions about repayment. The Department is not aware of</textblock>
    <textblock>any operational difficulties with how State agencies and households</textblock>
    <textblock>currently communicate about claims collections. Current rules at</textblock>
    <textblock>7 CFR 273.15(h) provide that requests for fair hearings may be oral</textblock>
    <textblock>or in writing so long as they are clear and if they are not, State</textblock>
    <textblock>agencies may ask households for clarification. The Department</textblock>
    <textblock>encourages State agencies to apply this standard to communications</textblock>
    <textblock>concerning elections of repayment methods. Consequently, the final</textblock>
    <textblock>rule does not specify ways households must communicate elections</textblock>
    <textblock>about repayment methods.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed rule would have amended 7 CFR 273.13(b) which lists</textblock>
    <textblock>exemptions from notices of adverse action. As mentioned earlier in</textblock>
    <textblock>this preamble, the proposed rule would have added situations where</textblock>
    <textblock>the State agency initiates allotment reduction against a household</textblock>
    <textblock>which has been provided notice of its appeal rights for the</textblock>
    <textblock>underlying claim to the list of exemptions. No commenter objected</textblock>
    <textblock>to this action or indicated the need for clarification.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consequently, the final rule adopts the language as proposed in</textblock>
    <textblock>7 CFR 273.13(b)(14). Several commenters did remark about an</textblock>
    <textblock>associated statement in the preamble which was that the claim</textblock>
    <textblock>itself was the adverse action, not the collection action. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Department believes that the changes in this final rule clarify</textblock>
    <textblock>that statement. Households are due notice of specific appeal</textblock>
    <textblock>rights regarding claims such as how the claim arose, the</textblock>
    <textblock>information on which the claim is based, how the amount of the</textblock>
    <textblock>claim was calculated and the right to contest the claim. Once</textblock>
    <textblock>those due process requirements have been met and the claim has been</textblock>
    <textblock>established, State agencies are expected to proceed to collection</textblock>
    <textblock>activities without additional notices of adverse action.</textblock>
    <textblock>Technical Corrections to Current Rules</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department used the proposed rule to correct two errors in 7</textblock>
    <textblock>CFR 273.18(d)(3) of current rules which resulted from the final</textblock>
    <textblock>Administration-Management rule published February 22, 1990 (55 FR</textblock>
    <textblock>6233). The first correction clarified that a notice of adverse</textblock>
    <textblock>action is required when a claim is not established in a fair</textblock>
    <textblock>hearing. It deleted the phrase which limited this requirement to</textblock>
    <textblock>those circumstances where ``the amount of the claim'' had not been</textblock>
    <textblock>established. The one comment received on this matter was from a</textblock>
    <textblock>State agency which indicated it was already in compliance with the</textblock>
    <textblock>broader requirement. Consequently, the final rule adopts the</textblock>
    <textblock>language as stated in the proposed rulemaking.</textblock>
    <textblock>The second correction reinstated a provision in 7 CFR</textblock>
    <textblock>273.18(d)(4)(iii) allowing other methods of collecting claims for</textblock>
    <textblock>IHE and State agency error claims. A commenter objected on the</textblock>
    <textblock>grounds that the law does not authorize other collection methods</textblock>
    <textblock>for IHE claims. However, section 13(b)(2)(B) of the Food Stamp Act</textblock>
    <textblock>of 1977 (7 U.S.C. 2022(b)(2)(B)) does authorize such collection action</textblock>
    <textblock>for IHE claims. Accordingly, the final rule adopts the language as</textblock>
    <textblock>stated in the proposed rulemaking.</textblock>
    <textblock>State Agency Retention of Claims Against Households</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed rule would have reduced the recipient claims retention</textblock>
    <textblock>rate for State agencies from 50 percent to 25 percent for IPV</textblock>
    <textblock>claims and from 25 percent to 10 percent for IHE claims. The</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed rule further specified that the new rates are effective</textblock>
    <textblock>for the period beginning October 1, 1990 and ending September 30,</textblock>
    <textblock>1995. Beginning October 1, 1995 the old rates of 50 percent for</textblock>
    <textblock>IPV claims and 25 percent for IHE claims will again take effect.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed rule also would have allowed State agencies the</textblock>
    <textblock>opportunity to submit a one-time request for any additional amount</textblock>
    <textblock>due under the old, higher retention rates by November 30, 1991.</textblock>
    <textblock>Four comments were received on this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>As explained in the proposed rule, the Department had previously</textblock>
    <textblock>directed State agencies to implement the new retention rates for</textblock>
    <textblock>reporting and payment purposes. This was done in order to comply</textblock>
    <textblock>with the Act and to minimize the need for revised reporting on the</textblock>
    <textblock>Form FNS-209, Status of Claims Against Households. Effective with</textblock>
    <textblock>the first quarter Fiscal Year 1991 FNS-209 report, the Department</textblock>
    <textblock>has been recovering funds from State agencies at the new retention</textblock>
    <textblock>rates in accordance with the Act. The Department had also</textblock>
    <textblock>previously advised State agencies of the procedure for requesting</textblock>
    <textblock>any additional retention due on collections received prior to</textblock>
    <textblock>October 1, 1990 and the deadline for filing such requests.</textblock>
