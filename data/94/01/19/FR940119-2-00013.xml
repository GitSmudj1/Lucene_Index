    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Corporation for National and Community Service announces the availability of a first draft of a technical assistance handbook, ``Principles for High Quality National Service Programs, January 1994 (Proposed).'' The Corporation invites comments and suggestions on the draft handbook from interested members of the public.</textblock>
    <textblock>The draft handbook is the product of an ongoing collaboration between the Corporation and members of the national service community. It contains examples, suggestions, and principles to assist potential Corporation grantees in developing high quality national service programs. As part of the Corporation's technical assistance for applicants, the draft handbook will be included in the application packages for all national service programs. In addition, it may be provided as background reading to the Corporation's grant application reviewers. However, the principles in the draft handbook are not the criteria by which reviewers will assess grant applications. Applications will be assessed based on the requirements and criteria in the application and the Corporation's regulations.</textblock>
