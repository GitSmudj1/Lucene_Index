    <textblock>Morris Leasing Co., Ltd. (Morris), a noncarrier, has filed a verified notice of exemption to acquire and operate the following rail lines owned by Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail), in St. Joseph County, MI: (1) The Quincy Secondary Track, between milepost 421.2, at or near White Pigeon and milepost 406.84, at or near Sturgis; (2) the GR&amp;I Industrial Track, between milepost 146.4 and milepost 150.7, at or near Sturgis; and (3) the Goshen Industrial Track, between milepost 28.4 and milepost 29.3, at or near Sturgis. The line segments total a distance of approximately 19.56 miles. Morris indicates that it will enter into an agreement with Michigan Southern Railroad Company, Inc.
