    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of Energy announces that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(5), it is making a discretionary financial assistance award based on the criterion set forth at 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2)(i)(D) to the New York University Medical Center (NYUMC), Tuxedo, New York, under Grant Number DE-FG01-94EH89435. The DOE intends to make a noncompetitive financial assistance award. The purpose of the proposed grant is to support a one-year project during which NYUMC will generate a comprehensive monograph on chelation therapy to be used in the case of nuclear accidents or major chemical spills. This effort will have a total estimated cost of $89,023 to be provided by the DOE.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed grant will provide funding to NYUMC to generate a comprehensive monograph on chelation therapy to be used in the case of nuclear accidents or major chemical spills. After completion of the monograph and the grant, the DOE plans to print and distribute the monograph very widely and make it instantly available to the general public and to any public national or international institution where radiation or chemical contamination may occur and is a concern. This includes the general medical community, physicians specializing in nuclear medicine, local, state, and Federal public health officials, power generating stations, universities, and major hospitals. The material will be used not only as an emergency reference manual, but also for teaching purposes at teaching and training centers such as the Radiation Emergency Assistance Center/Training Site (REAC/TS). This project is planned for a one-year period of performance commencing on or about April 1, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>The project is meritorious because of its relevance to the accomplishment of an important public purpose_providing a reference source for any physician treating any person who has been in an accident involving radionuclides or chemical exposures. A prime example of this would be people exposed as a result of a nuclear leak or accident during transport of an atomic weapon or of highly radioactive waste on public roads. This means that any member of the public could benefit from this effort. The monograph will be a preventive measure to allow public institutions to deal rapidly and effectively with such an accident, should one occur. In addition, the monograph will be used as a teaching source in universities and medical schools training students on the methods used to treat radiation or chemical exposures. NYUMC is recognized as a leading national training center in medicine with well recognized training programs in fields like environmental health, radiation biology, and environmental pollution. NYUMC is one of the Nation's oldest and foremost centers for research in the health effects of environmental pollution. NYUMC has the full-time faculty, supporting staff, graduate students, and post-doctoral fellows to produce the monograph. The faculty is among the most knowledgeable in the Nation in areas like biomarkers and the use of chelation for the treatment of radiation or chemical accidents. The applicant has exclusive domestic capability to perform the activity successfully, based upon experience and technical expertise in chelation therapy as applied to nuclear accidents or major chemical spills. The DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting or is planning to conduct such an activity.</textblock>
    <textblock>Based on the evaluation of relevance to the accomplishment of a public purpose, it is determined that the proposal represents a beneficial method and approach to disseminate to the public information on chelation therapy.</textblock>
