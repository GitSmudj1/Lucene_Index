    <textblock>The leak detection performance data should be provided as a log and may be submitted either as a computer printout or on a diskette using standard ASCII format. Historical performance data gathered during developmental phases such as system installation and modification also should be submitted.</textblock>
    <textblock>It would be helpful if commenters group data for each different data collection time period or pipeline segment, so that all data (questions 1-6) relates to only one specific segment and time period. For the purposes of these questions, a pipeline segment is defined as that part of the pipeline between two points where the product can be contained, such as between two pressure pump stations, between a pressure pump station and a terminal, between a pressure pump station and a valve, or between two valves.</textblock>
    <textblock>Question 1</textblock>
    <textblock>: Provide the following general information about the segment of hazardous liquid pipeline to which the series of questions 1-6 relate:</textblock>
    <textblock>1.1␣Pipeline segment length description covered in this data submission:</textblock>
    <textblock>1.1.1␣Starting point (mile post or survey station no.)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>1.1.2␣Ending point (mile post or survey station no.)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>1.1.3␣Length of segment (miles)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>1.2␣Pipeline nominal diameter (in.)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>1.3␣Number of pumping stations on segment?</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>1.4␣Number of injection points on segment?</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>1.5␣Number of delivery points on segment?</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>1.6␣Commodity(s) transported during this data history</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>1.7␣Nominal flow rate (bbls/day)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>1.8␣Beginning date covered by this data history (MM/DD/YY)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>1.9␣Ending date of this data history (MM/DD/YY)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>Question 2:</textblock>
    <textblock>Classify the leak detection system(s) installed on this pipeline segment (check each that applies and answer questions 4 through 6 for each system checked).</textblock>
    <textblock>2.1␣Mass balance</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>2.2␣Pressure wave</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>2.3␣External hydrocarbon sensor</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>2.4␣Other (specify)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>Question 3</textblock>
    <textblock>: For each leak detection system checked in Question 2, check whether the system was supplied by an independent vendor or was the system developed within your company.</textblock>
    <textblock>3.1␣For the system in Question 2.1?</textblock>
    <textblock>3.1.1␣Vendor (name)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>3.1.2␣Internal company developed</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>3.2␣For the system in Question 2.2?</textblock>
    <textblock>3.2.1␣Vendor (name)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>3.2.2␣Internal company developed</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>3.3␣For the system in Question 2.3?</textblock>
    <textblock>3.3.1␣Vendor (name)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>3.3.2␣Internal company developed</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>3.4␣For the system in Question 2.4?</textblock>
    <textblock>3.4.1␣Vendor (name)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>3.4.2␣Internal company developed</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>Question 4</textblock>
    <textblock>: For the alarm history, leak detection system availability history, and performance data of the leak detection system submitted, include answers to the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>4.1␣For the time period reported, at what threshold volume was the leak detection system set to alarm (including any error bandwidth that is incorporated into that amount) (bbls.)?</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>4.2␣At that volume how long should detection take (mins.)?</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>4.3␣What was the average detection time for that volume (mins.)?</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>4.4␣For each alarm during the time period reported in your response to Question 4, include the following data:</textblock>
    <textblock>4.4.1␣Alarm Initiated (MM/DD/YR &amp; hours &amp; minutes in military time</textblock>
    <textblock>6</textblock>
    <textblock>)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>4.4.2␣Alarm Cleared (MM/DD/YR &amp; hours &amp; minutes in military time)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>4.4.3␣The length of time it took to identify the cause of the alarm (if not equal to the difference between the initiation and cleared time)(mins.)?</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>4.5␣For each alarm, was the alarm attributed to one of these causes (Y/N)?</textblock>

  <footnote>
    <textblock>``Military time'' is using a 24 hour clock. For instance,</textblock>
    <textblock>4:00 pm = 1600 hours or 5:15 pm = 1715 hours.</textblock>
