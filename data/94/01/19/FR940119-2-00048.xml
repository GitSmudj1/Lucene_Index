    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) (7 U.S.C. 136p), the Administrator may, at her discretion, exempt a State agency from any registration provision of FIFRA if she determines that emergency conditions exist which require such exemption. The Applicant has requested the Administrator to issue a specific exemption for the use of imidacloprid on apples to control aphids. Information in accordance with 40 CFR part 166 was submitted as part of this request.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Applicant states that aphids have been a chronic pest of apples in Washington. Aphids feed on the plant tissues of young trees, which can stunt growth and possibly affect future productivity of the tree. On large, vigorous trees, the primary concern is fruit damage. Aphids excrete such large amounts of honeydew that it drips on the fruit, causing russetting or providing a substrate for the growth of sooty mold. The value of such damaged fruit is considerably reduced, as it is diverted to a processing market. The Applicant states that some of the registered alternative pesticides, while once effective, have lost much of their effectiveness due to build-up of resistant aphid populations. Others are said to only provide suppression, and not adequately control aphids. One of the registered alternatives phosphamidon that is still somewhat effective for this pest problem was withdrawn from the market in 1991, due to non-support for re-registration, and existing stocks have been mostly depleted. Another chemical mevinphos was previously used for this pest, but cases of occupational poisoning of farm workers using this material led to a ban for use on Washington tree fruits, in 1993, because of human risk concerns. Therefore, the Applicant claims that Washington apple growers are left without adequate means to control aphids. The Applicant states that information collected last year for one sampling of apples indicated a 33 percent loss in crop value due to aphid damage.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Applicant proposes to apply imidacloprid at a maximum rate of 0.1 lb. active ingredient (a.i.), or 6.4 fluid oz. of product, per acre with a maximum of 5 applications on up to 160,980 acres of apples, with no more than 0.5 lb. a.i. (32 fluid oz. of product) applied per year. This amounts to a possible total of 80,490 lbs. of a.i., or 40,245 gal. of product. This is the first time that the Applicant has applied for the use of imidacloprid on apples. This notice does not constitute a decision by EPA on the application itself. The regulations governing section 18 require publication of a notice of receipt of an application for a specific exemption proposing use of a new chemical (i.e., an active ingredient not contained in any currently registered pesticide). Such notice provides for opportunity for public comment on the application. Accordingly, interested persons may submit written views on this subject to the Field Operations Division at the address above.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Agency, accordingly, will review and consider all comments received during the comment period in determining whether to issue the emergency exemption requested by the Washington Department of Agriculture.</textblock>
