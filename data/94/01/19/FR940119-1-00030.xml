    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document proposes the revocation of tolerances and feed additive regulations established under sections 408 and 409 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), 21 U.S.C. 346a and 348, respectively, for residues of the insecticide demeton (a mixture of</textblock>
    <textblock>O,O</textblock>
    <textblock>-diethyl</textblock>
    <textblock>O</textblock>
    <textblock>(and</textblock>
    <textblock>S</textblock>
    <textblock>)-2-(ethylthio)ethylphosphorothioates) in or on raw agricultural commodities and animal feeds. EPA is initiating this action because all registered uses of this chemical on raw agricultural commodities have been canceled.</textblock>
    <textblock>By mid-October 1989, all product registrations under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) for pesticide products containing the insecticide demeton were canceled. Based on the fact that demeton is no longer domestically registered for use on any food crops, and a tolerance is generally not necessary for a pesticide chemical which is not registered for the particular food use, EPA now proposes to revoke the tolerances and feed additive regulations for residues of demeton as listed 40 CFR 180.105 and 40 CFR 186.1600. Since the product registrations were canceled more than 3 years ago, residues should not appear in any legally treated, domestically produced commodities. These tolerances were obtained in conjunction with the FIFRA registrations.</textblock>
    <textblock>1.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 180.105.</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA is proposing to revoke the following tolerances for residues of the insecticide demeton in or on the following commodities: 12 parts per million in or on alfalfa hay, clover hay; 5 parts per million in or on almond hulls, barley (green fodder and straw), fresh alfalfa, fresh clover, oats (green fodder and straw), sugar beet tops, and wheat (green fodder and straw); 1.25 parts per million in or on grapes, hops; 0.75 part per million in or on almonds, apples, apricots, barley grain, broccoli, brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, cottonseed, filberts, grapefruit, lemons, lettuce, muskmelons, nectarines, oat grain, oranges, peaches, pears, peas, pecans, peppers, plums (fresh prunes), potatoes, strawberries, tomatoes, walnuts, wheat grain; 0.5 part per million in or on sugar beets; 0.3 part per million in or on beans, eggplants; 0.2 part per million in or on sorghum grain, sorghum forage.</textblock>
    <textblock>2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 186.1600</textblock>
    <textblock>. EPA is proposing to revoke a tolerance of 5 parts per million for residues of demeton in dehydrated sugar beet pulp for livestock feed.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Agency is not recommending the establishment of action levels in place of these tolerances and feed additive regulations because sufficient time has elapsed in order for the residues to dissipate and does not anticipate a residue problem due to environmental contamination.</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA has no information at this time to suggest that demeton is used on food commodities exported to the U.S. Therefore, EPA is requesting that interested persons submit information pertaining to whether these products are used in foreign countries and may be present in commodities grown in those countries and imported to the U.S.</textblock>
    <textblock>Within 30 days after publication of this document in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>, any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains demeton may request that this rulemaking proposal as it pertains to section 408 tolerances be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300316]. All written comments filed in response to this document will be available in the Public Information Branch, at the address given above from 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12866</textblock>
    <textblock>Under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, Oct. 4, 1993), the Agency must determine whether the regulatory action is ``significant'' and therefore subject to all the requirements of the Executive Order (i.e., Regulatory Impact Analysis, review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)). Under section 3(f), the order defines ``significant'' as those actions likely to lead to a rule (1) having an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more, or adversely and materially affecting a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local or tribal governments or communities (also known as ``economically significant''); (2) creating serious inconsistency or otherwise interfering with an action taken or planned by another agency; (3) materially altering the budgetary impacts of entitlement, grants, user fees, or loan programs; or (4) raising novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive Order.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to the terms of this Executive Order, EPA has determined that this rule is not ``significant'' and is therefore not subject to OMB review.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed regulatory action has been reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164; 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), and it has been determined that it will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses, small governments, or small organizations.</textblock>
    <textblock>This regulatory action is intended to prevent the sale of food commodities containing pesticide residues where the subject pesticide has been used in an unregistered or illegal manner.</textblock>
    <textblock>Since all registrations for use of demeton on food crops were canceled more than 3 years ago, it is anticipated that no economic impact would occur at any level of business enterprises if these tolerances were revoked. Accordingly, I certify that this proposed regulatory action does not require a separate regulatory flexibility analysis under the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</textblock>
