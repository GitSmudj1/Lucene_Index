    <textblock>For this series of questions, operators are requested to provide data</textblock>

    <textblock>40 CFR 230.3(t) states: The term</textblock>
    <textblock>wetlands</textblock>
    <textblock>means those areas that are inundated or saturated by surface or ground water at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas.</textblock>
