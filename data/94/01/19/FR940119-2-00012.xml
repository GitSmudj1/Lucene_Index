    <textblock>Commissioner of Customs,</textblock>
    <textblock>Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel, the directives issued to you on May 12, 1993, March 4, 1993, December 6, 1993 and October 22, 1993, by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. Those directives concern imports of certain cotton and man-made fiber textile products, produced or manufactured in the United Arab Emirates during the periods December 28, 1992 through December 27, 1993 (Category 219); March 1, 1993 through February 28, 1994 (Category 313); July 28, 1993 through July 27, 1994 (Category 317); October 28, 1993 through October 27, 1994) (Categories 326, 335/635 and 369-S).</textblock>
    <textblock>Effective on January 19, 1994, you are directed to establish and amend the limits for the categories listed below. The new restraint period for Category 219 shall be December 27, 1992 through December 31, 1994. The restraint period for the remaining categories shall be extended through December 31, 1994. Import charges already made to Categories 219, 313, 317, 326, 335/635 and 369-S shall be retained. Import charges for Categories 226 and 835 will be made at a later date.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854); pursuant to the Bilateral Textile Agreement of February 23, 1991, as amended and extended, between the Governments of the United States and the United Arab Emirates; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended and extended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on January 19, 1994, entry into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products in the following categories, produced or manufactured in the United Arab Emirates and exported during the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994, in excess of the following levels of restraint:</textblock>
    <textblock>Imports charged to these category limits, except Categories 315, 361 and 369-O, for the period beginning January 1, 1993 and extending through December 31, 1993 shall be charged against those levels of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balances. In the event the limits established for that period have been exhausted by previous entries, such goods shall be subject to the levels set forth in this directive.</textblock>
    <textblock>In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).</textblock>
