    <textblock>It is expected that most of the time the insurable value of the collateral will exceed the amount of all liens on the property (plus SBA's assistance, if unsecured). Thus, for most borrowers, the amount of flood insurance required would be determined by the liens on the property (plus SBA's assistance, if unsecured) so long as flood insurance in that amount were available under the NFI Act. On those occasions when the insurable value of the collateral dips below the liens on the property (plus SBA's assistance, if unsecured), only enough insurance to protect the collateral would be required.</textblock>

    <textblock>3. It would not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. It would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in E.O. 12866.</textblock>
