    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>OSM is announcing its decision to approve a proposed amendment to the Colorado permanent regulatory program (hereinafter referred to as the Colorado program), under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 (SMCRA). The proposed amendment consists of changes to provisions of Colorado's rules concerning backfilling and grading for the elimination of highwalls, and limited variances from approximate original contour (AOC) requirements. The amendment is intended to revise the Colorado program to be consistent with the corresponding Federal regulations and to improve operational efficiency.</textblock>

    <textblock>I. Background on the Colorado Program</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 15, 1980, the Secretary of the Interior conditionally approved the Colorado program for the regulation of coal exploration and coal mining and reclamation operations on non-Federal and non-Indian lands. General background information on the Colorado program, including the Secretary's findings, the disposition of comments, and a detailed explanation of the conditions of approval can be found in the December 15, 1980,</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(45 FR 82173). Actions taken subsequent to approval of the Colorado program are codified at 30 CFR 906.15, 906.16, and 906.30.</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Submission of Proposed Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>By letter dated March 19, 1993, Colorado submitted to OSM a proposed amendment to the rules of the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Board (Board) at 2 Code of Colorado Regulations (CCR) 407-2 (administrative record No. CO-536). Colorado submitted the proposed amendment at its own initiative.</textblock>
    <textblock>In its March 19, 1993, amendment, Colorado proposed to revise 2 CCR 407-2, Rule 4.14.1(2), performance standards for underground mining operations and remining operations; Rule 4.14.2, modifications by the Colorado Division of Minerals and Geology (Division) to the general backfilling and grading requirements for steep-slope, underground, and remining operations; and Rule 4.27.4, variances from AOC requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>OSM published a notice in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on April 14, 1993 (58 FR 19367), announcing receipt of the proposed amendment to the Colorado program and inviting public comment on its adequacy (administrative record No. CO-541). The public comment period was scheduled to end May 14, 1993. However, in response to a request for an extension of the public comment period, OSM published a notice in the May 12, 1993,</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(58 FR 27967) extending the public comment period until May 29, 1993 (administrative record No. CO-545).</textblock>
    <textblock>During its review of the amendment, OSM identified concerns with Rules 4.14.1(2) (f) and (g), regarding the need for a written demonstration that all reasonably available spoil is insufficient to completely backfill a highwall; Rules 4.14.1(2) (f) and (g), regarding the need to define the term ``reasonably available spoil''; Rules 4.14.1(2) (f)(iii) and (g)(iii), regarding the need to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulatory authority that a highwall remnant is stable; and Rule 4.14.1(2)(f)(i), regarding the need to require that all reasonably available spoil within the permit area be used to eliminate a highwall. OSM notified Colorado of these concerns by letter dated July 8, 1993 (administrative record No. CO-553).</textblock>
