  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This is an administrative change. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that the Justice Department could not require FOIA/PA requesters to provide notarized signatures to prove their identities, finding the policy clashed with other Federal law. Based on that ruling, the DoD Privacy Office has determined that DOD Component rules having a similar requirement for notarized signatures must be amended to eliminate the requirement.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, the Office of the Inspector General, DOD, is amending its rules to eliminate the requirement for notarized signatures.</textblock>

    <textblock>Executive Order 12866. The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense has determined that this Privacy Act rule for the Department of Defense does not constitute `significant regulatory action'. Analysis of the rule indicates that it does not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; does not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; does not materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; does not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866 (1993).</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act rule for the Department of Defense does not have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities because it is concerned only with the administration of Privacy Act systems of records within the Department of Defense.</textblock>
    <textblock>Paperwork Reduction Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Director, Administration and Management, Office of the Secretary of Defense certifies that this Privacy Act rule for the Department of Defense imposes no information requirements beyond the Department of Defense and that the information collected within the Department of Defense is necessary and consistent with 5 U.S.C. 552a, known as the Privacy Act of 1974.</textblock>
