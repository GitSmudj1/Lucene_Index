    <textblock>Recommendation</textblock>
    <textblock>The potential importance of variations in salinity on different time scales to the structure and dynamics of estuarine ecosystems should be considered in developing salinity standards. Deviations from the patterns of salinity variability in the historical data set could increase the risk of not achieving environmental goals and objectives even if mean positions of the 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>near-bottom isohaline were matched with the historical data sets.</textblock>
    <textblock>Justification</textblock>
    <textblock>There is strong biological evidence from a number of estuaries throughout the world that variability in flow, in circulation and mixing, in the salinity distribution, and in the distribution of other important properties and processes is important in maintaining a healthy estuarine ecosystem. Therefore, variability in flow above the threshold needed to meet the seasonal salinity standard is encouraged.</textblock>
    <textblock>(6) Conclusions</textblock>
    <textblock>Empirical statistical relationships were developed between a variety of estuarine properties and resources, and the position of the near-bottom 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline and other flow-related variables.</textblock>
    <textblock>The relationships developed are statistical relationships. They are not proof of cause-effect.</textblock>
    <textblock>The relationships indicate clearly, however, that the position of the near-bottom 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline can serve as a powerful diagnostic indicator of the condition of biological ``units'' (communities, populations) across a range of different trophic levels.</textblock>
    <textblock>With the information these relationships can provide, water managers will be in a far better position to regulate freshwater discharge to the estuarine system to produce, on the average,</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>predictable and desirable ecological responses of the estuary consistent with goals selected for the estuarine ecosystem. If this strategy is followed, the probability of the desired ecological response will be enhanced and the chances of undesirable ecological surprises in the estuary will be reduced.</textblock>
    <textblock>Because the statistical relationship between net Delta outflow and the position of the near-bottom 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline is strong, the position of the near-bottom 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline is an excellent surrogate for net Delta outflow in managing freshwater input to the estuary. The relationship may be improved further through routine direct monitoring of the position of the 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline and a suite of biological responses.</textblock>
    <textblock>Recommendation</textblock>
    <textblock>The salinity distribution should be monitored continuously at a series of at least six stations spaced approximately five kilometers apart and located along the channel between about Emmaton and Carquinez Bridge. Measurements should be made at least near the surface and near the bottom at each station. The data should be telemetered to a convenient location for timely analysis and interpretation. These continuous monitoring data should be supplemented with detailed surveys to map the distribution of salinity in three dimensions. The data should be readily available in a timely way to all interested parties.</textblock>
    <textblock>An appropriate biological monitoring program should determine responses of a variety of organisms to changes in position of the 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline.</textblock>
    <textblock>Justification</textblock>
    <textblock>During the second and third workshops, and during intersessions between workshops, a systematic search was made to select the most powerful tools of analysis to describe how diagnostic biological indicators respond to changes in position of the near-bottom 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline. When data were rich enough, other variables were included in the analyses.</textblock>
    <textblock>The first task was to specify the most diagnostic resource variables_the responses of indicators that would convey the maximum amount of environmental/ecological information. In every case, the objective was to demonstrate how these diagnostic environmental/ecological indicators responded to changes in the position of the near-bottom 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline and to a variety of other flow measures. In every case, experts on the particular biological response were consulted in selecting the appropriate averaging time for the position of the 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline.</textblock>
    <textblock>(7) Conclusion</textblock>
    <textblock>The position of the near-bottom 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>salinity isohaline is an index of habitat conditions for estuarine resources at all trophic levels, including the supply of organic matter to the food web of Suisun Bay, an important nursery area. In other words, well-behaved statistical relationships exist between the near-bottom 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline and many estuarine resources for which sufficient data exist to make appropriate analyses. Moreover, at least a rudimentary understanding exists for the causal mechanisms underlying many of these relationships. The location of the near-bottom 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline is important either because it is a direct causal factor or because it is highly correlated with a direct causal factor (e.g., diversions).</textblock>
    <textblock>Preliminary analyses show that errors in prediction using models which incorporate only the position of the 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline are comparable to the errors using more complex models which incorporate additional flow-related variables. In other words, given the present data sets, predictive models using only the position of the near-bottom 2</textblock>
    <textblock>U</textblock>
    <textblock>isohaline perform as well as more complex models that incorporate other variables. However, some of these other variables may be very important in affecting habitat and the condition of biological resources of the estuary.</textblock>
