    <textblock>This interim final rule is issued under the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. 1801</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule makes minor changes designed to clarify and facilitate implementation of Amendment 6. NMFS became aware of the need for these changes while implementing the Pacific coast groundfish limited-entry program, a new and complex regulatory system. These changes need to be in place when the fishery itself begins to operate under the limited-entry system on January 1, 1994. Most of the changes effected by this rule are necessary to conform the implementing regulations to the letter and intent of Amendment 6 to the FMP. As such, these provisions were discussed and were subject to public comment and scrutiny during the years the Council developed Amendment 6. Furthermore, the revisions and clarifications are necessary to uniformly administer the program and to ensure accurate recordkeeping. These provisions will not result in any significant changes in the day-to-day operating practices of the fishery. Accordingly, the Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and (d), that it would be unnecessary and contrary to the public interest to delay the effectiveness of these provisions pending advance notice and comment and a 30-day delay in effectiveness.</textblock>
    <textblock>The revision of 50 CFR 663.22(d)(1) is the only change that was not necessarily contemplated by Amendment 6; however, it would be impracticable and contrary to the public interest to provide advance notice and comment before the fishery converts to limited-entry because, without it, permit owners and potential purchasers would be susceptible to substantial losses if permits could be freely transferred by permit lessees.</textblock>
