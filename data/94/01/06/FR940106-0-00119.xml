    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document contains a final rule amending the regulations on trade adjustment assistance for workers which implement the 1988 Amendments to the Trade Act of 1974 as contained in the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. This action will update the regulations and will provide uniform instructions to State agencies in carrying-out their responsibilities under the Trade Act. These State agencies act as agents of the United States for the purpose of providing adjustment assistance benefits and services to adversely affected workers. Comments are requested on the several material changes being made in this final rule, which differ from the September 1988 proposed rule, and on a number of other changes which were not included in the proposed rule.</textblock>
