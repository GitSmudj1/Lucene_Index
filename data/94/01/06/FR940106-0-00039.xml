    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations that appear at 38 CFR 4.87a, diagnostic code 6210, establish the criteria for evaluating disease of the auditory canal. Due to VA error, that criteria contains the word ``serious'' instead of the word ``serous.'' This document corrects that error.</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations that appear at 38 CFR 4.88a, diagnostic code 6311, establish the criteria for evaluating military tuberculosis. Due to VA error, that type of tuberculosis is identified as ``military'' instead of ``miliary'' tuberculosis. This document corrects that error.</textblock>
