  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule would revise Onshore Oil and Gas</textblock>
    <textblock>Order No. 5 under 43 CFR 3164.1, originally issued February 24, 1989 (54 FR 8100), and made effective March 27, 1989, for new facilities, August 23, 1989, for existing facilities measuring 200 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) or more per day of gas, and February 26, 1990, for existing facilities producing less than 200 Mcf per day of gas. This proposed revision would reorganize the Order to make it more logical in sequence, remove unnecessary provisions, resolve internal inconsistencies discovered in the Order, and clarify certain provisions. These changes are based on several years of experience implementing the Order, and on suggestions from the public.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Order No. 5, Measurement of Gas, implements and supplements requirements found in 43 CFR Part 3160 relating to the measurement of gas produced under the terms of Federal and Indian (except Osage) oil and gas leases, as well as gas produced from State or privately owned lands when Federal and/or Indian leases receive a share of such production under the terms of an approved agreement. The Order addresses gas measurement by orifice meter and gas measurement by other methods acceptable to the authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Gas measurement by electronic flow computers, utilizing an orifice, which calculate volume using the equations specified by the American Gas Association (AGA) Committee Report No. 3, may be implemented without prior approval if the minimum standards outlined in the Order are adhered to.</textblock>
