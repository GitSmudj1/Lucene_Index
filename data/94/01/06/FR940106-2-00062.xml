    <textblock>In addition, for final notices such as this, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that this notice would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all HHAs are treated as small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>This final notice with comment period announces the provisions of section 13564(b) of OBRA '93, which provides for the elimination of the A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based HHAs, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993. None of the provisions of this notice interprets or extends requirements beyond those set forth in OBRA '93.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 13564(b) of OBRA '93 will result in significant Federal cost savings. The impact of this provision is discussed further below. This notice explains how the provision affects the methodology for calculating the HHA limits. We do not believe that merely explaining the results of this provision in this notice produces any effect that will meet any of the criteria of E.O. 12866 for a significant regulatory action or will have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, we have determined and the Secretary certifies that neither an impact statement under E.O. 12866 nor a regulatory flexibility analysis under the RFA are required.</textblock>
    <textblock>To the extent that a legislative provision being announced by a notice such as this may have a significant effect on beneficiaries or providers or may be viewed as controversial, we believe that we should address any potential concerns. In this instance, we believe it is desirable to inform the public of our estimate of the substantial budgetary effect of this statutory change. We estimate that the elimination of the add-on for hospital-based HHAs will result in the following savings to the Medicare program:</textblock>
    <textblock>We have attempted to examine the overall effects of this provision on hospital-based HHAs. As illustrated in Table 2 below, we estimate that the elimination of the A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based HHAs will result in substantial increases in the number of hospital-based HHAs that meet or exceed the cost limits.</textblock>
