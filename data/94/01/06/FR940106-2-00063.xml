    <textblock>The model used for our analysis is based on data from 1,599 hospital-based HHAs. In our July 8, 1993 notice, which used the same model, we estimated that 774 hospital-based HHA in the model would meet or exceed the HHA cost limits. Thus, we believe that the proportion of hospital-based HHAs that will meet or exceed the cost limits is likely to increase from approximately 48 percent (774/1599) to 72 percent (1144/1599) as a result of the elimination of the A&amp;G add-on.</textblock>
    <textblock>We are unable to identify the effects of this provision on individual hospital-based home health agencies. However, we anticipate that overall FY 1994 Medicare payments for hospital-based HHAs will be approximately 6 percent less than they would have been if the A&amp;G add-on had not been eliminated. The effects of this reduction on the total revenues of individual hospital-based HHAs will depend on the HHA's ability to operate within the cost limits and on the proportion of the HHA's revenues that come from the Medicare program.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 1102(b) of the Act requires the Secretary to prepare a regulatory impact analysis if a final notice such as this may have a significant impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals. Such an analysis must conform to the provisions of section 604 of the RFA. For purposes of section 1102(b) of the Act, we define a small rural hospital as a hospital with fewer than 100 beds located outside of a Metropolitan Statistical Area.</textblock>
    <textblock>We have not prepared a rural impact statement since we have determined and the Secretary certifies that this final notice will not have a significant economic impact on the operations of a substantial number of small rural hospitals.</textblock>
    <textblock>IV. Other Required Information</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Waiver of Proposed Notice and 30-Day Delay in the Effective Date</textblock>
    <textblock>In adopting notices such as this, we ordinarily publish a proposed notice in the Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>with a 60-day period for public comment as required under section 1871(b)(1) of the Act. We also normally provide a delay of 30 days in the effective date for documents such as this. However, we may waive these procedures if we find good cause that prior notice and comment or a delay in the effective date are impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 13564(b)(1) of OBRA '93 amended section 1861(v)(1))(L)(ii) of the Act to eliminate, effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993, the adjustment to the HHA cost limits to recognize the administrative and general costs of hospital-based HHAs. In conformance with the clear direction of section 13564(b)(1) of OBRA '93, this notice announces the elimination of the adjustment to the HHA cost limits to recognize the administrative and general costs of hospital-based HHAs and explains the effect that this action will have on methodology for calculating the cost limits of hospital-based HHAs. We have made no changes in this methodology beyond those directly required by section 13564(b)(1) of OBRA '93, nor are there any other discretionary aspects to this notice. Moreover, section 13564(b)(2) of OBRA '93 mandates that these provisions are effective beginning with cost reporting periods beginning on or after</textblock>
    <textblock>October 1, 1993. Thus, we have concluded that in this instance, it would be impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest to publish a proposed notice or to provide for a 30-day delay in the effective date of this notice. Therefore, we find good cause to waive publication of a proposed notice and the 30-day delay in effective date. However, we are providing a 60-day period for public comment, as indicated at the beginning of this notice.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>This final notice does not impose information collection requirements. Consequently, it does not need to be reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3507).</textblock>
    <textblock>C. Public Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>Because of the large number of items of correspondence we normally receive on a notice with comment period, we are not able to acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we will consider all comments concerning the provisions of this notice that we receive by the date and time specified in the ``</textblock>
    <textblock>DATES</textblock>
    <textblock>'' section of this notice, and, if changes are made in another notice, we will respond to these comments in that notice.</textblock>
