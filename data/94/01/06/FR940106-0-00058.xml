    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>NMFS announces the 1994 fishery specifications and management measures for groundfish taken in the U.S. exclusive economic zone and state waters off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California as authorized by the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery Management Plan (FMP). The specifications include the level of the acceptable biological catch (ABC) and harvest guidelines including the distribution between domestic and foreign fishing operations. The management measures for 1994 are designed to keep landings within the harvest guidelines, for those species for which there are harvest guidelines and to achieve the goals and objectives of the FMP and its implementing regulations. The intended effect of these actions is to establish allowable harvest levels of Pacific coast groundfish and to implement management measures designed to achieve but not exceed those harvest levels while extending fishing and processing opportunities as long as possible during the year.</textblock>
