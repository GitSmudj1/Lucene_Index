  <text>
    <textblock>Department</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>DOL</textblock>
    <textblock>mean the United States Department of Labor.</textblock>
    <textblock>Director</textblock>
    <textblock>means the chief official of the United States Employment Service (USES), Employment and Training Administration, Department of Labor, or the Director's designee.</textblock>
    <textblock>Division</textblock>
    <textblock>means the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment Standards Administration, DOL.</textblock>
    <textblock>Employer</textblock>
    <textblock>means a person, firm, corporation, or other association or organization involved in the direct provision of health care services, which:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Suffers or permits a person to work;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Has a location within the United States to which U.S. workers may be referred for employment;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Proposes to employ workers at a place within the United States; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Has an employer-employee relationship with respect to employees under subpart D and E of this part, as indicated by the fact that it may hire, pay, fire, supervise or otherwise control the work of such employee.</textblock>
    <textblock>Employment</textblock>
    <textblock>means full-time work by an employee for an employer/health care facility other than oneself. ``Full-time work'' means work where the nurse is regularly scheduled to work 40 hours or more per week, unless the facility documents as part of its attestation that it is common practice for the occupation at the facility or for the occupation in the geographic area for nurses to work fewer hours per week.</textblock>
    <textblock>Employment and Training Administration (ETA)</textblock>
    <textblock>means the agency within the Department of Labor (DOL) which includes the United States Employment Service (USES).</textblock>
    <textblock>Employment Standards Administration (ESA)</textblock>
    <textblock>means the agency within the Department of Labor (DOL) which includes the Wage and Hour Division.</textblock>
    <textblock>Facility</textblock>
    <textblock>means a user of nursing services with either a single site or a group of contiguous locations at which it provides health care services. ``Facility'' includes an employer of registered nurses which provides health care services in a home or other setting, such as a hospital, nursing home, or other site of employment, not owned or operated by the employer (</textblock>
    <textblock>e.g.</textblock>
    <textblock>, a visiting nurse association or a nursing contractor). ``Facility'' also includes a private household which employs or seeks to employ one or more H-1A nurses, but does not include a private household which uses H-1A nurses only through a nursing contractor. Groups of structures which form a campus or separate buildings across the street from one another are a single facility. However, separate buildings or areas which are not physically connected or in immediate proximity are a single health care facility if they are in reasonable geographic proximity, used for the same purpose, and share the same nursing staff and equipment. An example is an entity which manages a nursing home and a hospital in the same area and which regularly shifts or rotates the nurses between the two. Non-contiguous sites, even within the same geographic area, which do not share the same nursing staff and operational purposes are not a single facility. For example, hospitals which are located on opposite sides of a municipality, but which are managed or owned by a single entity, are separate facilities if they do not regularly share nursing staff and operational purpose.</textblock>
    <textblock>Geographic area</textblock>
    <textblock>means the area within normal commuting distance of the place (address) of the intended worksite. If the geographic area does not include a sufficient number of facilities to make a prevailing wage determination, the term ``geographic area'' shall be expanded (by the State employment service, unless directed not to do so by the Director) with respect to the attesting facility to include a sufficient number of facilities to permit a prevailing wage determination to be made. If the place of the intended worksite is within a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), any place within the MSA may be deemed to be within normal commuting distance of the place of intended employment.</textblock>
    <textblock>Governor</textblock>
    <textblock>means the chief elected official of a State or the Governor's designee.</textblock>
    <textblock>H-1A nurse</textblock>
    <textblock>means any nonimmigrant alien admitted to the United States to perform services as a nurse under section 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a) of the Act (8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(a)).</textblock>
    <textblock>Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)</textblock>
    <textblock>means the component of the Department of Justice which makes the determination under the Act on whether to grant visa petitions to petitioners seeking the admission of nonimmigrant nurses under H-1A visas.</textblock>
    <textblock>Layoff</textblock>
    <textblock>means any involuntary separation of one or more staff nurses without cause/prejudice. If a staff nurse is separated from one specialized activity and is offered retraining and retention at the same facility in another activity involving direct patient care at the same wage and status, but refuses such training and retention, such separation shall not constitute a layoff. The layoff provision applies to staff nurses only, not to other health occupations. If the position occupied by the staff nurse is covered by a collective bargaining agreement, the collective bargaining agreement definition of ``layoff'' (if any) shall apply to that position.</textblock>
    <textblock>Lockout</textblock>
    <textblock>means a labor dispute involving a work stoppage, wherein an employer withholds work from its employees in order to gain a concession from them.</textblock>
    <textblock>Nurse</textblock>
    <textblock>means a person who is or will be authorized by a State Board of Nursing to engage in registered nursing practice in a State or U.S. territory or possession at a facility which provides health care services. A staff nurse means a nurse who provides nursing care directly to patients. In order to qualify under this definition of ``nurse'' the alien shall:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Have obtained a full and unrestricted license to practice nursing in the country where the alien obtained nursing education, or have received nursing education in the United States or Canada;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Have passed the examination given by the Commission on Graduates for Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS), or have obtained a full and unrestricted (permanent) license to practice as a registered nurse in the state of intended employment, or have obtained a full and unrestricted (permanent) license in any state or territory of the United States and received temporary authorization to practice as a registered nurse in the state of intended employment; and,</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Be fully qualified and eligible under the laws (including such temporary or interim licensing requirements which authorize the nurse to be employed) governing the place of intended employment to practice as a registered nurse immediately upon admission to the United States, and be authorized under such laws to be employed by the employer. For purposes of this paragraph, the temporary or interim licensing may be obtained immediately after the alien enters the United States and registers to take the first available examination for permanent licensure.</textblock>
