    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 3, 1991, REA published a final rule on part 1773, at 56 FR 63354, concerning audits of REA borrowers. Part 1773 implements the standard REA security instrument provision requiring REA borrowers to prepare and furnish to REA, at least once during each 12-month period, a full and complete report of its financial condition, operations, and cash flows, in form and substance satisfactory to REA, audited and certified by an independent CPA, satisfactory to REA, and accompanied by a report of such audit, in form and substance satisfactory to REA. A report of the audit was defined in ยง1773.1 to include the auditor's report, report on compliance, report on internal controls and management letter.</textblock>
    <textblock>The management letter is prepared by the CPA and addresses specific internal control, compliance, and other program issues not typically addressed in the standard auditor's report, report on internal controls, or report on compliance. The requirements for preparing a management letter are set forth in ยง1773.34, Management Letter. This final rule revises and clarifies ยง1773.34(e). Section 1773.34 (e)(1)(i) for electric borrowers and ยง1773.34 (e)(2)(i) for telephone borrowers requires CPAs to test compliance with the loan and security instrument provision requiring borrowers to maintain insurance. REA is currently reviewing its insurance requirements to determine if these requirements are representative of current industry standards. Therefore, until such time as REA's review is completed and revisions, if any, to current policies are finalized, CPAs will not be required to test for compliance with the mortgage provision relating to insurance.</textblock>
