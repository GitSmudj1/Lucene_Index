    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>We are extending the date on which parts A and B of the cardiovascular system listings, found in appendix 1 of part 404, subpart P, will no longer be effective from January 6, 1994, to February 15, 1994. We have made no revisions in the medical criteria in the cardiovascular system listings; they remain the same as they now appear in the Code of Federal Regulations. We are presently considering comments we received on a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to update the medical criteria contained in part A and part B of the cardiovascular system listings. When we have completed our review, any revised criteria will be published as final regulations.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 6, 1985, a revised Listing of Impairments in appendix 1 to subpart P of part 404 was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(50 FR 50068). The Listing of Impairments describes, for each of 13 major body systems, impairments that are considered severe enough to preclude a person from engaging in any gainful activity (part A), or in the case of a child under the age of 18, impairments that are considered severe enough to prevent the child from functioning independently, appropriately, and effectively in an age-appropriate manner (part B). The Listing of Impairments is used for evaluating disability and blindness at the third step of the sequential evaluation process for adults and children under the Social Security disability program and the supplemental security income program.</textblock>
    <textblock>When the revised Listing of Impairments was published in 1985, we indicated that medical advances in disability evaluation and treatment and program experience would require that the listings be periodically reviewed and updated. Accordingly, we established termination dates ranging from 4 to 8 years for each of the listings for specific body systems. A date of December 6, 1989, was established for the cardiovascular system listings in part A to no longer be effective. A date of December 6, 1993, was established for part B of the cardiovascular system listings to no longer be effective.</textblock>
    <textblock>The potential program impact of the changes to update the cardiovascular system listings required careful analysis and consideration within the Agency. As our analysis continued, it became evident that we would be unable to publish a proposed and then a final regulation containing revised criteria for part A of the cardiovascular system listings by December 6, 1989. We published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of December 5, 1989 (54 FR 50233), a final regulation extending the current part A cardiovascular system listings for a period of 18 months through June 5, 1991. The part A cardiovascular system listings were again extended an additional 12 months through June 5, 1992, by final regulation published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on June 6, 1991 (56 FR 26030), and were extended to January 5, 1993, by final regulation published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on June 5, 1992 (57 FR 23945), and to July 6, 1993, by final regulation published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on December 29, 1992 (57 FR 61795). The part A and part B cardiovascular system listings were extended to January 6, 1994, by final regulation published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36133).</textblock>
