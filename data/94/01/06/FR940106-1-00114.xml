    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes</textblock>
    <textblock>threatened status for the Sacramento splittail (</textblock>
    <textblock>Pogonichthys</textblock>
    <textblock>macrolepidotus</textblock>
    <textblock>) pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as</textblock>
    <textblock>amended (Act). Sacramento splittail occur in Suisun Bay and the San</textblock>
    <textblock>Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary in California. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Sacramento splittail has declined by 62 percent over the last 15 years.</textblock>
    <textblock>This species is primarily threatened by large freshwater exports from</textblock>
    <textblock>Sacramento and San Joaquin River diversions, prolonged drought, loss of</textblock>
    <textblock>shallow-water habitat, introduced aquatic species, and agricultural and</textblock>
    <textblock>industrial chemicals. This proposal, if made final, would implement the</textblock>
    <textblock>protection and recovery provisions afforded by the Act for Sacramento</textblock>
    <textblock>splittail. The Service seeks all available data and comments from the</textblock>
    <textblock>public regarding this proposal.</textblock>
  </summary>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>As used in this rule, the term ``Delta'' refers to all tidal waters</textblock>
    <textblock>contained within the legal definition of the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta, as delineated by section 12220 of</textblock>
    <textblock>the State of California's Water Code of 1969. Generally, the Delta is</textblock>
    <textblock>contained within a triangular area that extends south from the city of</textblock>
    <textblock>Sacramento to the confluence of the Stanislaus and San Joaquin Rivers on</textblock>
    <textblock>the southeast corner and Chipps Island in Suisun Bay at the southwest</textblock>
    <textblock>corner. The term ``Estuary,'' as used in this rule, refers to tidal</textblock>
    <textblock>waters contained in the Sacramento River and San Joaquin Rivers, the</textblock>
    <textblock>Delta, and the San Pablo and San Francisco Bays.</textblock>
    <textblock>Sacramento splittail were first described in 1854 by W.O. Ayres as</textblock>
    <textblock>Leuciscus macrolepidotus</textblock>
    <textblock>and by S.F. Baird and C. Girard as</textblock>
    <textblock>Pogonichthys</textblock>
    <textblock>inaeqilobus.</textblock>
    <textblock>Although Ayres' species description is accepted, the</textblock>
    <textblock>species was assigned to the genus</textblock>
    <textblock>Pogonichthys</textblock>
    <textblock>in recognition of the</textblock>
    <textblock>distinctive characteristics exhibited by the two splittail species</textblock>
    <textblock>P.</textblock>
    <textblock>ciscoides</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>P. macrolepidotus</textblock>
    <textblock>(Hopkirk 1973).</textblock>
    <textblock>P. ciscoides,</textblock>
    <textblock>endemic</textblock>
    <textblock>to Clear Lake, Lake County, California, has been extinct since the early</textblock>
    <textblock>1970s. The Sacramento splittail (hereafter splittail) represents the</textblock>
    <textblock>only extant species in its genus.</textblock>
    <textblock>The splittail is a large cyprinid that can exceed 40 centimeters (16</textblock>
    <textblock>inches) in length (Moyle 1976). Adults are characterized by an</textblock>
    <textblock>elongated body, distinct nuchal hump, and small, blunt head, usually</textblock>
    <textblock>with barbels at the corners of the slightly subterminal mouth. The</textblock>
    <textblock>enlarged dorsal lobe of the caudal fin distinguishes the splittail from</textblock>
    <textblock>other minnows in the Central Valley of California. Splittail are dull,</textblock>
    <textblock>silvery-gold on the sides and olive-gray dorsally. During spawning</textblock>
    <textblock>season, the pectoral, pelvic, and caudal fins are tinged with an orange-red color. Males develop small white nuptial tubercles on the head.</textblock>
    <textblock>Splittail are endemic to California's Central Valley, where they</textblock>
    <textblock>were once widely distributed (Moyle 1976). Historically, splittail were</textblock>
    <textblock>found as far north as Redding on the Sacramento River, as far south as</textblock>
    <textblock>the present-day site of Friant Dam on the San Joaquin River, and as far</textblock>
    <textblock>upstream as the current Oroville Dam site on the Feather River and</textblock>
    <textblock>Folsom Dam site on the American River (Rutter 1908). Recreational</textblock>
    <textblock>anglers in Sacramento reported catches of 50 or more splittail per day</textblock>
    <textblock>prior to damming of these rivers (Caywood 1974). The species was used</textblock>
    <textblock>as part of the Central Valley Native American diet (Caywood 1974).</textblock>
