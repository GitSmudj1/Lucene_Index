    <textblock>History</textblock>
    <textblock>Airspace Docket 93-ASO-17, published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 54953), changed the effective hours of certain Class D Airspace areas from full time to part time. The Columbus Golden Triangle Airport was inadvertently included in the list of Class D Airspace areas in error. The Columbus Golden Triangle Airport is Class E2 airspace, an airspace area designated as a surface area for an airport. Airspace Docket No. 93-ASO-18, published on October 25, 1993 (58 FR 54954), changed the effective hours of certain Class E airspace areas from full time to part time. The Columbus Golden Triangle Airport was inadvertently omitted from the list of Class E airspace areas. This action corrects the errors by changing the designation of the Columbus Golden Triangle, MS Airspace area from Class D to Class E.</textblock>
