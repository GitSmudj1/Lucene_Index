    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This interim final rule amends the regulations governing the Pacific coast groundfish limited-entry fishery to: (1) Clarify distinctions between holders, owners, and lessees of limited-entry permits in the Pacific coast groundfish fishery by adding definitions of these terms and making minor corrections consistent with the new definitions; (2) clarify that shrimp (including spot and ridgeback prawn) trawls, California halibut trawls, and California sea cucumber trawls are ``exempted gear''; (3) delete trip limits for groundfish taken in the pink shrimp and spot and ridgeback prawn trawl fisheries; (4) designate trip limits in the pink shrimp and spot and ridgeback prawn fisheries as ``routine'' management measures; (5) modify the method of calculating allocations for the ``open-access'' fishery; and (6) clarify that the sablefish ``regular'' season for nontrawl gear only applies to the limited-entry groundfish fishery. These actions are necessary to make the regulations implementing the Fishery Management Plan for the Pacific Coast Groundfish Fishery (FMP) consistent with Amendment 6 (limited entry) to the FMP, and to improve recordkeeping and enforcement of regulations in the Pacific coast groundfish fishery.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 16, 1992, NOAA promulgated regulations (57 FR 54001) that establish a license limitation limited-entry program for the Pacific coast commercial groundfish fishery based on the issuance of gear-specific Federal permits (the ``limited-entry program''). Under the program, permits are initially issued to owners of qualifying vessels. Permits with type ``A'' gear endorsements are transferrable, and may be leased by one vessel owner to another. The implementing regulations, codified at 50 CFR part 663, subpart C, use the terms ``permit holder'' and ``permit owner'' interchangeably, and do not clearly define the relationship between permit owners and permit lessees. This lack of definition creates potential recordkeeping and enforcement problems. These problems stem from a person being able to ``own'' a permit, but lease it to someone else. Maintenance of records identifying the permit owner, even if the permit is currently registered to a lessee, is essential for recording and enforcement purposes. The NMFS records system is the only place available to officially record permit ownership, and give notice to creditors, purchasers, encumbrancers, and other interested parties. NMFS itself needs to know who owns the permit in the event it becomes necessary to take an enforcement action such as sanctioning the permit or collecting a delinquent penalty.</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, the first clarification made by this interim final rule is to add the following definitions for ``permit owner,'' ``permit lessee,'' and ``permit holder.'' A ``permit owner'' is defined as the person owning the permit; a ``permit lessee'' is defined as a person who does not own the permit, but has the right to possess and use it for a designated period, with reversion to the permit owner; and ``permit holder'' is an umbrella term which includes both ``permit owners'' and ``permit lessees.'' This rule amends the regulations in multiple paragraphs to use the term ``permit owner'' rather than ``permit holder'' when appropriate, and to amend the definition of ``owner'' to ``owner of a vessel'' or ``vessel owner'' to distinguish a vessel owner from a ``permit owner.'' These revisions clarify that only permit owners may transfer a limited-entry permit to a different person, thus not allowing a lessee to transfer the permit to someone other than the permit owner.</textblock>
    <textblock>With respect to administration of the limited-entry program, the terms ``permit holder,'' ``permit owner,'' and ``permit lessee'' are used for ease of understanding only, and do not signify traditional property rights. As stated in Amendment 6,</textblock>
    <textblock>Groundfish limited entry permits and endorsements confer a right to participate in the Pacific coast groundfish fishery with a limited entry gear in accordance with the limited entry system established under the Pacific Coast Groundfish FMP as modified by this chapter of the FMP (created under Amendment 6) or any future amendment which may modify or even abolish the limited entry system. The permits and endorsement are also subject to sanctions, including revocation, as provided by the Magnuson Fishery Conservation and Management Act, 16 U.S.C. at 1858(g) and 15 CFR part 904, subpart D.</textblock>
