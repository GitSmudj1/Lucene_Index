    <textblock>Calculation of Amount Not Subject to an Exception to the Limits Freestanding SNF Located in Dallas, Texas:</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Impact Statement</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12866 (E.O. 12866) requires us to prepare an analysis for any rule that meets one of the E.O. 12866 criteria for a ``significant regulatory action''; that is, that may_</textblock>
    <textblock>•Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;</textblock>
    <textblock>•Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;</textblock>
    <textblock>•Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or</textblock>
    <textblock>•Raise a novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in E.O. 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition for final notices such as this, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612) unless the Secretary certifies that this notice will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. For purposes of the RFA, all SNFs are treated as small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>This final notice with comment period announces the provisions of section 13503(a) of OBRA '93, which provides for a delay in the updates of the limits on payments for routine SNF services through cost reporting periods beginning before October 1, 1995, and provides for the elimination of the A&amp;G add-on for hospital-based SNFs effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993. None of the provisions of this notice interprets or extends requirements beyond those set forth in OBRA '93.</textblock>
    <textblock>Sections 13503(a)(1) and (3) of OBRA '93 will result in significant Federal cost savings. The impact of these provisions is discussed further below. This notice explains the revised methodology for calculating the SNF limits that results from the provisions of OBRA '93. We do not believe that merely reflecting these provisions in this notice produces any effect that will meet any of the criteria of E.O. 12866 for a significant regulatory action or will have a significant effect on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, we have determined and the Secretary certifies that neither an impact analysis under E.O. 12866 nor a regulatory flexibility analysis under the RFA are required.</textblock>
    <textblock>To the extent that a legislative provision being announced by a notice such as this may have a significant effect on beneficiaries or providers or may be viewed as controversial, we believe that we should address any potential concerns. In this instance, we believe it is desirable to inform the public of our estimate of the substantial budgetary effect of these statutory changes. We estimate that these statutory provisions will result in the following savings to the Medicare program:</textblock>
