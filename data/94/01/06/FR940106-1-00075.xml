    <textblock>The relationship between number of days at Port Chicago and Sacramento Basin Index (Figure 3) yields differences of required number of days within year types of as much as 40 days in dry years. With the difference in flows required to sustain the isohaline at Port Chicago (29,000 cfs) and Chipps Island (12,000 cfs), the theoretical difference in water costs within a year type could be substantial. The actual costs are likely to be lower, however, because flows sufficient to trigger the standard are often followed by a considerable period of elevated flows sufficient to meet the required number of days. These differences are likely to be fully realized in dry and critical years when conditions in the Delta are fully controlled by the projects.</textblock>
    <textblock>Chipps Island Equation (see figure 2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Days = 26.3 * Index ^ 1.13 * (index) ^ 4.6</textblock>
    <textblock>This equation results in small differences within each of the year types, with the exception of critical years.</textblock>
