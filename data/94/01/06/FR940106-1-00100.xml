    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) revises its proposed designation of critical habitat for the delta smelt (</textblock>
    <textblock>Hypomesus transpacificus</textblock>
    <textblock>) originally published on October 3, 1991, concurrently with the proposal to list the species, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The final rule listing the delta smelt as a threatened species was published on March 5, 1993. In the final rule, the Service postponed the decision on critical habitat determination for up to 1 year beyond the date that the final rule was due (October 3, 1993) in accordance with section 4(b)(6)(C)(ii) of the Act. The Service has refined the primary constituent elements described in the original critical habitat proposal. This revised proposed rule supersedes all aspects of the Service's previous proposal. Critical habitat designation for the delta smelt would provide additional protection under section 7 of the Act with regard to activities that require Federal agency action. As required by section 4 of the Act, the Service will consider economic and other relevant impacts prior to making a final decision on the size and configuration of critical habitat. The Service solicits data and comments from the public on all aspects of this revised proposal.</textblock>

    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Previous Service Action</textblock>
    <textblock>In the January 6, 1989 (50 FR 554), Animal Notice of Review, the Service included the delta smelt as a category 1 candidate species. Category 1 includes species for which data in the Service's possession are sufficient to support proposals for listing. On June 29, 1990, the Service received a petition dated June 26, 1990, from Dr. Don C. Erman, President-Elect of the California-Nevada Chapter of the American Fisheries Society, to list the delta smelt as an endangered species with critical habitat. The Service made a 90-day finding that substantial information had been presented indicating that the petitioned action may be warranted and announced this decision in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on December 24, 1990 (55 FR 52852). On October 3, 1991 (56 FR 50075), the Service published a proposal to list the delta smelt as a threatened species and to designate critical habitat. This proposed rule constituted the 12-month petition finding in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>Critical habitat was proposed for areas of all water and all submerged lands below ordinary high water and the entire water column bounded by and contained within Suisun Bay (including the contiguous Grizzly and Honker Bays), the length of Montezuma Slough, portions of the Sacramento River, portions of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, portions of the San Joaquin River, and the contiguous water bodies in between (a complex of bays, dead-end sloughs, channels typically less than four meters deep, marshlands, etc.), California. The public comment period opened on the date of publication of the proposed rule (October 3, 1991) and closed on January 31, 1992.</textblock>
