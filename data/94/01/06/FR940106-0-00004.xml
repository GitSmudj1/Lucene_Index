    <textblock>The Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that good cause exists to publish this final rule without prior notice and opportunity for public comment.</textblock>
    <textblock>Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this final rule are impracticable, unnecessary, and contrary to the public interest, and since this regulatory change is mandated by Congress, there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 for making this final rule effective as of January 1, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule amends a footnote in the regulations that quotes the Act, in order to conform the footnote to the Act, as amended by the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>The amendments to the regulations will have no practical impact on importations of honeybees and honeybee semen from Canada or Mexico since it merely quotes the Act. Furthermore, such importations are already allowed from any part of Canada. Currently, the only regular movement of honeybees from Canada to the United States is a relatively insignificant movement from the Maritime Provinces of Canada to northern New England. We anticipate that the amendments will have little practical impact with regard to importations from Mexico. Sufficient numbers of honeybees are already available in the United States to make it unnecessary to import honeybees or honeybee semen from Mexico.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12778</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule (1) Preempts all State and local laws and regulations that are inconsistent with this rule; (2) has no retroactive effect; and (3) does not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>

    <textblock>The criteria for determining which countries may be listed in this part as countries from which honeybees or honeybee semen may be imported into the United States are set forth in 7 U.S.C. 282. In this regard, 7 U.S.C. provides in relevant part, that:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) In order to prevent the introduction and spread of diseases and parasites harmful to honeybees, and the introduction of genetically undesirable germ plasm of honeybees, the importation into the United States of all honeybees is prohibited, except that honeybees may be imported into the United States_</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) By the United States Department of Agriculture for experimental or scientific purposes;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) From countries determined by the Secretary of Agriculture_</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) To be free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) To have in operation precautions adequate to prevent the importation of honeybees from other countries where harmful diseases or parasites, or undesirable species or subspecies, of honeybees exist; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) From Canada or Mexico, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Agriculture determines appropriate, if the Secretary determines that the region of Canada or Mexico from which the honeybees originated is, and is likely to remain, free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Honeybee semen may be imported into the United States only from:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Countries determines by the Secretary of Agriculture to be free of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees, and which have in operation precautions adequate to prevent the importation of such undesirable honeybees and their semen; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Canada or Mexico, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the region of Canada or Mexico from which the imports originate is, and is likely to remain, free of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees.</textblock>
