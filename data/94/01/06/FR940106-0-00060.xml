    <textblock>Footnotes Are for Table 1</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>The acceptable biological catch (ABC) for sablefish, widow rockfish, and bocaccio is calculated after regulation-induced discard has been deducted, and therefor applies to landed catch (including observed incidental catch in the whiting fishery).</textblock>
    <textblock>b</textblock>
    <textblock>U.S. portion.</textblock>
    <textblock>c</textblock>
    <textblock>These species are not common nor important in the areas footnoted. Accordingly, for convenience, Pacific cod is included in the ``other fish'' category for the areas footnoted, and rockfish species are included in the ``remaining rockfish'' category for the areas footnoted only.</textblock>
    <textblock>d</textblock>
    <textblock>Coastwide ABC including Canadian waters. The U.S. harvest guideline is 80 percent of the U.S./Canada ABC.</textblock>
    <textblock>e</textblock>
    <textblock>Dover sole, thornyheads, and trawl-caught sablefish are managed together as the ``DTS complex'' (formerly called the deepwater complex). There is no harvest guideline for the DTS complex.</textblock>
    <textblock>f</textblock>
    <textblock>All subareas except Conception, which does not have a harvest guideline. The sablefish trawl and nontrawl allocations also are harvest guidelines. (See the section on trawl and nontrawl sablefish management for 1994).</textblock>
    <textblock>g</textblock>
    <textblock>Open access and limited entry allocation percentages for sablefish north of the Conception subarea are applied to only to the nontreaty fishery which is 6,700 mt in 1994. (7,000 mt harvest guideline minus 300 mt for the treaty Indian fishery).</textblock>
    <textblock>h</textblock>
    <textblock>Only jack mackerel caught north of 39</textblock>
    <textblock>○00</textblock>
    <textblock>’ N. latitude are governed by the FMP. The ABC and harvest guideline also include area beyond 200 nm.</textblock>
    <textblock>i</textblock>
    <textblock>Harvest guidelines for commercial harvests of all species of rockfish by members of the Makah, Quileute, Hoh, and Quinault Indian tribes are established as follows: 51,000 pounds (23.1 mt) for the area between the U.S.-Canada border and Cape Alava (48</textblock>
    <textblock>○09</textblock>
    <textblock>’30</textblock>
    <textblock>’</textblock>
    <textblock>’ N. latitude); and 10,000 pounds (4.5 mt) for the area between Destruction Island (47</textblock>
    <textblock>○40</textblock>
    <textblock>’00</textblock>
    <textblock>’</textblock>
    <textblock>’ N. latitude) and Leadbetter Point (46</textblock>
    <textblock>○38</textblock>
    <textblock>’10 N. latitude).</textblock>
    <textblock>j</textblock>
    <textblock>The POP harvest guideline applies to the Vancouver/Columbia subareas combined. A discard factor of 16 percent was deducted from the 1993 harvest guideline to determine the 1994 harvest guideline.</textblock>
    <textblock>k</textblock>
    <textblock>The thornyhead harvest guideline includes both species in the Monterey, Eureka, and Columbia subareas. The 1994 harvest guideline is derived by subtracting a discard factor (8 percent) from the 1993 harvest guideline.</textblock>
    <textblock>l</textblock>
    <textblock>The Sebastes-North harvest guideline applies to the Vancouver and Columbia subareas and equals the sum of the ABCs in those areas: canary (2,300 mt), yellowtail rockfish (6,740 mt minus 300 mt), and remaining rockfish (7,000 mt). The Vancouver/Columbia portion for yellowtail rockfish is derived by subtracting a 300 mt estimate for the Eureka subarea ABC from the total ABC for the Vancouver/Columbia/Eureka areas.</textblock>
    <textblock>m</textblock>
    <textblock>The Sebastes-South harvest guideline is the sum of the ABCs for the species in the Eureka/Monterey/Conception subareas: bocaccio (1,540 mt), canary (600 mt), chilipepper (4,000 mt), yellowtail rockfish (300 mt), and remaining rockfish (7,000 mt).</textblock>
    <textblock>n</textblock>
    <textblock>The bocaccio harvest guideline applies to the Eureka, Monterey, and Conception subareas.</textblock>
    <textblock>o</textblock>
    <textblock>The open access and limited entry allocation percentages for bocaccio are applied only to the commercial portion of the harvest guideline, which is 1,340 mt in 1994. (The 1,540 mt harvest guideline minus 200 mt estimated harvest by the recreational fishery).</textblock>
    <textblock>p</textblock>
    <textblock>The yellowtail rockfish assessment addresses three separate areas: Vancouver, Columbia north of Cape Lookout, and Columbia south of Cape Lookout plus Eureka. For this table, the Columbia ABC means north Columbia only, and the Eureka ABC means Eureka plus south Columbia. The total ABC for yellowtail rockfish is divided into two harvest guidelines: 4,160 mt for the northern area (Vancouver plus Columbia north of Cape Lookout) and 2,580 mt for the southern area (Eureka plus Columbia area south of Cape Lookout). (Separate harvest guidelines are established for the Sebastes complex north and south of the Eureka-Columbia border. Therefore, 300 mt of the yellowtail rockfish southern harvest guideline is included in the southern Sebastes complex harvest guideline, and the remainder of the yellowtail rockfish southern harvest guideline is included in the northern Sebastes complex harvest guideline.) A 16 percent discard factor will be added to certain landings of yellowtail rockfish inseason. This will affect inseason landings estimates for the Sebastes complex also.</textblock>
    <textblock>q</textblock>
    <textblock>The 16,900 mt harvest guideline applies coastwide, and includes a 5,000 mt harvest guideline for the Columbia subarea. The Columbia subarea harvest guideline is higher than its ABC, and is intended to be reduced to ABC (4,000 mt) in 1995.</textblock>
    <textblock>r</textblock>
    <textblock>Includes sharks, skates, rays, ratfish, morids, grenadiers and other groundfish species noted above in footnote c.</textblock>
