    <textblock>For purchased new home blood glucose monitors furnished to Medicare beneficiaries, we propose the following special payment limits:</textblock>
    <textblock>Initial Year Special Payment Limits</textblock>
    <textblock>Continental U.S</textblock>
    <textblock>$57</textblock>
    <textblock>Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands</textblock>
    <textblock>$65</textblock>
    <textblock>These proposed limits are based on pricing and manufacturers' rebates contained in the Winter 1993 edition of the Bruce Medical Supply catalog. We based the proposed limits for the continental U.S. on the median net cost, rounded to the nearest dollar, of five of the six monitors listed in the catalog. We omitted the Checkmate monitor because this monitor is relatively new to the market and has little market history. We determined the cost for each monitor to be equal to the Bruce Medical Supply list price decreased by the manufacturer's mail-in rebate (if applicable) and increased by appropriate shipping and handling charges effective December 1992. After making the adjustments for rebates and shipping and handling charges, we are proposing a limit of $57 which exceeds the final cost for four of the six monitors listed in the catalog. We permitted an additional shipping charge of $8 for monitors that are purchased in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition, our review of current pricing and rebate information shows that several brands of new home blood glucose monitors can be widely purchased at prices below the proposed limits.</textblock>
    <textblock>The information we used to calculate the proposed limits is presented below.</textblock>
    <textblock>The final median cost of the monitors listed in the Bruce catalog, excluding the Checkmate monitor, including shipping and handling, and rounded to the nearest dollar is $57. We propose that this amount be established as the special payment limit for new home blood glucose monitors furnished within the continental United States. The final median cost for these monitors, if furnished in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, or the United States Virgin Islands, including shipping and handling, and rounded to the nearest dollar is $65. We propose that this amount be established as the special payment limit for new home blood glucose monitors furnished outside the continental United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>We recognize that shipping and handling costs are unique to mail-order outlets and are not generally experienced by retail outlets; however, we have chosen to include these shipping and handling costs, without regard to the type of supplier, as a proxy for similar costs such as transportation and overhead that might be incurred by retail stores. The average shipping and handling cost per monitor in the continental U.S. is approximately $7, an amount that we believe sufficiently reflects expenses incurred by retail stores that supply home blood glucose monitors. The additional shipping allowance of $8 is intended to reflect additional costs of shipping outside the continental U.S.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Purchased Used Home Blood Glucose Monitors</textblock>
    <textblock>Historically, Medicare allowed payment amounts for the purchase of used DME have been set at approximately 75 percent of the corresponding allowed payment amounts for the purchase of new DME. Based on this ongoing policy, for purchased used home blood glucose monitors, the special payment limits would be equal to 75 percent of the special payment limits for purchased new monitors. If the special payment limit for a purchased new home blood glucose monitor is $57, the special payment limit for the purchased used monitor would be $42.75.</textblock>
