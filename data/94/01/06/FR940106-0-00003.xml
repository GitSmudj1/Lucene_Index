    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations in 7 CFR part 322 (referred to below as the regulations)</textblock>
    <textblock>govern the importation into the United States of honeybees and honeybee semen.</textblock>
    <textblock>These regulations were established pursuant to the Honeybee Act (7 U.S.C. 281</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.) The Honeybee Act was designed to prevent the movement into the</textblock>
    <textblock>Â§United States of diseases and parasites harmful to honeybees. In addition,</textblock>
    <textblock>the Honeybee Act was designed to prevent the movement into the United States</textblock>
    <textblock>of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 322.1 of the regulations contains a footnote that includes the</textblock>
    <textblock>criteria set forth in the Honeybee Act for determining which countries may be</textblock>
    <textblock>listed in the regulations as countries from which honeybees or honeybee semen</textblock>
    <textblock>may be imported into the United States. In this rule, we are amending that</textblock>
    <textblock>footnote to reflect amendments to the Honeybee Act made by section 361(d)(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 8, 1993, President Clinton signed the North American Free</textblock>
    <textblock>Trade Agreement (NAFTA), to become effective January 1, 1994. To implement</textblock>
    <textblock>this agreement, Congress passed the North American Free Trade Agreement</textblock>
    <textblock>Implementation Act (the Act) (Pub. L. 103-182). The statutory amendments</textblock>
    <textblock>included in the Act become effective coincident with NAFTA.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 361(d)(2) of the Act amended subsections (a) and (b) of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Honeybee Act by providing the following: (1) That honeybees may be imported</textblock>
    <textblock>from Canada or Mexico, subject to such terms as the Secretary of Agriculture</textblock>
    <textblock>determines appropriate, if the Secretary determines that the region of Canada</textblock>
    <textblock>or Mexico from which the honeybees originated is, and is likely to remain,</textblock>
    <textblock>free of diseases or parasites harmful to honeybees, and undesirable species or</textblock>
    <textblock>subspecies of honeybees; and (2) that honeybee semen may be imported from</textblock>
    <textblock>Canada or Mexico, if the Secretary of Agriculture determines that the region</textblock>
    <textblock>of Canada or Mexico from which the imports originate is, and is likely to</textblock>
    <textblock>remain, free of undesirable species or subspecies of honeybees. (See Pub. L.</textblock>
    <textblock>103-182; 107 Stat. 2057).</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule is being published to conform a footnote in the regulations with</textblock>
    <textblock>the Act, as amended.</textblock>
