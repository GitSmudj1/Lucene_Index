    <textblock>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA)</textblock>
    <textblock>announces that applications for fiscal year (FY) 1994 Grants for</textblock>
    <textblock>Establishment of Departments of Family Medicine are being</textblock>
    <textblock>accepted under the authority of section 747(b), (previously section 780) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act, title VII, as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408, dated October 13, 1992. Comments are invited on the proposed minimum percentage for ``High Rate'' and ``Significant Increase in the Rate'' for Implementation of the General Statutory Funding Preference, and proposed funding priority stated below.</textblock>
    <textblock>Approximately $9.4 million will be available for the Grants for Establishment of Departments of Family Medicine program in FY 1994. Total continuation support recommended is $5.7 million. It is anticipated that $3.7 million will be available to support approximately 22 competing awards averaging $170,000.</textblock>
    <textblock>Purpose</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 747(b) of the PHS Act authorizes support to schools of medicine and osteopathic medicine to meet the costs of projects to establish, maintain, or improve family medicine academic administrative units (which may be departments, divisions, or other units) to provide clinical instruction in family medicine. Funds awarded will be used to: (l) Plan and develop model educational predoctoral, faculty development and graduate medical education programs in family medicine which will meet the requirements of section 747(a), by the end of the project period of section 747(b) support; and (2) support academic and clinical activities relevant to the field of family medicine.</textblock>
    <textblock>The program may also assist schools to strengthen the administrative base and structure that is responsible for the planning, direction, organization, coordination, and evaluation of all undergraduate and graduate family medicine activities. Funds are to complement rather than duplicate programmatic activities for actual operation of family medicine training programs under section 747(a).</textblock>
    <textblock>Previous Funding Experience</textblock>
    <textblock>Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions regarding submission of an application for this program.</textblock>
    <textblock>In FY 1993, HRSA reviewed 50 competing applications for the Grants for Departments of Family Medicine program. Of those applications 82 percent were approved and 18 percent were disapproved. Twelve projects, or 24 percent of applications received, were funded.</textblock>
    <textblock>In FY 1992, HRSA reviewed 71 competing applications. Of those applications, 66 percent were approved and 34 percent were disapproved. Thirty-six projects, or about 50 percent of the applications received, were funded.</textblock>
    <textblock>Eligibility</textblock>
    <textblock>To be eligible to receive support for this grant program, the applicant must be a public, or nonprofit private, accredited school of medicine or osteopathic medicine.</textblock>
    <textblock>To receive support, programs must meet the requirements of final regulations as set forth in 42 CFR part 57, subpart R,</textblock>
    <textblock>and section 791(b) of the PHS Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>The period of Federal support will not exceed 5 years.</textblock>
    <textblock>National Health Objectives for the Year 2000</textblock>

    <textblock>Education and Service Linkage</textblock>
    <textblock>As part of its long-range planning, HRSA will be targeting its efforts to strengthening linkages between U.S. Public Health Service education programs and programs which provide comprehensive primary care services to the underserved.</textblock>

    <textblock>4. The potential of the project to continue on a self-sustaining basis.</textblock>
