    <textblock>Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities</textblock>
    <textblock>involving endangered or threatened wildlife species under certain</textblock>
    <textblock>circumstances. Regulations governing permits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and</textblock>
    <textblock>17.23. Permits for threatened species are available for scientific</textblock>
    <textblock>purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of the species, and for</textblock>
    <textblock>incidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. In some</textblock>
    <textblock>instances, permits may be issued during a specified period of time to</textblock>
    <textblock>relieve undue economic hardship that would be suffered if such relief</textblock>
    <textblock>were not available. For threatened species, permits are lawful for</textblock>
    <textblock>zoological exhibition, educational purposes, or special functions</textblock>
    <textblock>consistent with the purposes of the Act. Further information regarding</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations and requirements for permits may be obtained from the U.S.</textblock>

    <textblock>any threat (or lack thereof) to this species;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The location and status of any additional populations of this</textblock>
    <textblock>species and the reasons why any habitat should or should not be</textblock>
    <textblock>determined to be critical habitat as provided by section 4 of the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>Biological information that would be useful in determining whether to</textblock>
    <textblock>designate critical habitat includes descriptions and locations of</textblock>
    <textblock>spawning habitat and life history information on behavior and ecological</textblock>
    <textblock>needs;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and</textblock>
    <textblock>population size of this species; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their</textblock>
    <textblock>possible impacts on this species.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any final decision on this proposal will take into consideration the</textblock>
    <textblock>comments and any additional information received by the Service, and</textblock>
    <textblock>such communications may lead to final regulations that differ from this</textblock>
