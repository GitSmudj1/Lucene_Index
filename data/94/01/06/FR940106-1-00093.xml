    <textblock>Appendix II to the Preamble_Determination of Historical Conditions</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix II summarizes the methodology used in developing the historical conditions data presented in Table 1, above.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Calculating Delta Outflow Over Historical Period</textblock>
    <textblock>Net Delta outflow at Chipps Island is estimated by performing a water balance at the boundary of the Delta. The water balance involves adding the total Delta inflow and Delta precipitation runoff, then subtracting Delta channel depletions and exports.</textblock>
    <textblock>See</textblock>
    <textblock>Equation 1, below. DWR has estimated net Delta outflow for water years 1956-present with their flow accounting model, DAYFLOW. A similar model, using a smaller number of measured flows, was used to estimate Delta outflow from 1929-1962. In the years of overlap the two models yield very similar results.</textblock>
    <textblock>Equation 1</textblock>
    <textblock>: Delta outflow = river inflows + precipitation</textblock>
    <textblock>^ channel depletions_exports</textblock>
    <textblock>The four components used to calculate net Delta outflow are based on a variety of measurements. Most of the river inflows are gaged or directly measured at some point before they enter the Delta. Local precipitation is derived by multiplying the surface area of the Delta by the rainfall recorded at Stockton. Local precipitation is usually a trivial amount of flow but within-Delta uses (called channel depletions) can be substantial. Prior to construction of Shasta Dam and its regulation of Sacramento River flow, net Delta outflow was often negative during summer months because channel depletions exceeded Delta outflow. The level of channel depletions in DAYFLOW are based on average monthly crop demands for the acreage of each crop grown on Delta islands. Exports are directly measured at the point of diversion.</textblock>
    <textblock>Because of the arithmetic nature of these estimates of Delta outflow, the estimated flows cannot reflect the impacts of such factors as the spring/neap tidal cycles, wind, etc. that would affect the actual mean daily flow velocities in the western Delta.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Calculation of Historical Occurrence of 2 ppt Isohaline Position</textblock>
    <textblock>The daily estimates of net Delta outflow from October 1, 1939 to September 30, 1975 were used to calculate the frequency with which the 2 ppt isohaline was downstream of each of the specified positions in each year. Isohaline position is a function of net Delta outflow on a particular day and the isohaline position on the previous day, as specified in Eq. 2. (Kimmerer and Monismith 1993).</textblock>
    <textblock>Equation 2:</textblock>
    <textblock>Mean daily position of 2 ppt near-bottom isohaline (X2) on day t:</textblock>
    <textblock>X2</textblock>
    <textblock>(t)</textblock>
    <textblock>= 10.16 + (0.945 times X2</textblock>
    <textblock>(t-1)</textblock>
    <textblock>)</textblock>
    <textblock>^ (1.487 times log</textblock>
    <textblock>10</textblock>
    <textblock>(Delta outflow))</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Adjustment for Water Year Type</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed criteria were developed to reflect the average position of the 2 ppt isohaline in different water year types, according to the classification adopted by the State Board (SWRCB 1991). First, for each year from 1940 to 1975, the number of days on which the 2 ppt level was attained at each target location was tabulated. These totals were then averaged across each water year type. Because no critical years were available for comparison during this historical period, the average position of the 2 ppt isohaline in critical years was extrapolated from the other year types. The extrapolation was performed by fitting a curvilinear model to the averages for the other year types. These extrapolations are shown in Figures 1 and 2, above. The results of average number of days for each year type, along with the extrapolated values for critical years, are presented in Table 1, above.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Sensitivity to Starting Assumptions</textblock>
    <textblock>No estimate of the location of the 2 ppt isohaline on October 1, 1939 was available, so the starting position in October 1939 was assumed to be 75 km. However, sensitivity analysis showed that the calculated isohaline position on February 1 was largely independent of the assumed isohaline position on the preceding October 1. This sensitivity analysis was performed as follows: for each of the ten years from 1940 to 1949, the February 1 isohaline position was calculated under two assumptions: (1) that the October 1 starting position was at the Golden Gate (km 0), and (2) that the October 1 starting position was 100 km upstream of the Golden Gate. The historical delta outflow patterns and volumes differed greatly among these years and the calculated February 1 isohaline positions ranged from 49 km above the Golden Gate after wet winters to as much as 72 km above the Golden Gate during dry winters. However, by February 1 the difference in calculated positions based on the two different starting positions varied by no more than 0.1 km in any year.</textblock>
