    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) announces a 1-year finding on a petition to list the longfin smelt (</textblock>
    <textblock>Spirinchus thaleichthys</textblock>
    <textblock>) under the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The Service determines that the petitioned action is not warranted at this time. The longfin smelt occurs from the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San Joaquin River Estuary in California to Prince William Sound in Alaska. Although the southernmost populations are declining, little or no population trend data are available for estuaries in Oregon and Washington. The species may be surviving and reproducing in Puget Sound, Skagit Bay, Grays Harbor, Willapa Bay, the Columbia River, Yaquina Bay, and Coos Bay. Large numbers are found in the Gulf of Alaska 5 to 6 miles off shore. The listing of a Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary vertebrate population segment is also not warranted at this time because that population does not seem to be biologically significant to the species as a whole, and may not be sufficiently reproductively isolated.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 5, 1992, the Service received a petition from Mr. Gregory A. Thomas of the Natural Heritage Institute to add the longfin smelt to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and to designate critical habitat in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and estuary. In his letter, Mr. Thomas identified the following eight organizations as co-petitioners: American Fisheries Society, Bay Institute of San Francisco, Natural Heritage Institute, Planning and Conservation League, Save San Francisco Bay Association, Friends of the River, San Francisco Baykeeper, and the Sierra Club. On June 24, 1993, the Service issued a 90-day finding, a notice of which was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on July 6, 1993 (58 FR 36184), that the petition presented substantial information indicating that the requested action may be warranted. The Service initiated a status review and analyzed available data on this species (Meng 1993). Additional sources of information describing the human factors and projects that may affect this species include expert testimonies presented to the California State Water Resources Control Board's 1987 Water Quality/Water Rights Proceeding on the San Francisco Bay and Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta and 1992 Water Rights Phase of the Bay-Delta Estuary Proceedings.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act requires that the Service issue a finding within 1 year of the receipt of the petition on whether the petitioned action is (a) not warranted, (b) warranted, or (c) warranted but precluded from immediate proposal by other pending proposals of higher priority.</textblock>
    <textblock>In casual conversations, the petitioner indicated that he intended the petition to be a request to list the Sacramento-San Joaquin River estuary population. However, the Service did not receive this request in writing and, in any case, was required to review the status of the species on a rangewide basis prior to considering the appropriateness of listing individual population segments. The Service determines that listing of the Sacramento-San Joaquin estuary population segment of the longfin smelt is not warranted.</textblock>
    <textblock>Longfin smelt is an euryhaline species with a 2-year life cycle (Moyle 1976, Moyle and Yoshiyama 1992). Spawning occurs in fresh water over sandy-gravel substrates, rocks, or aquatic plants. Spawning may take place as early as November and extend into June, although the peak spawning period is from February to April (Wang 1986). After hatching, larvae move up into surface waters and are transported downstream into brackish-water nursery areas. Sacramento-San Joaquin River outflow into Suisun and San Pablo Bays has been positively correlated with longfin smelt recruitment (Stevens and Miller 1983) because higher outflow increases larval dispersal and the area available for rearing (Wang 1986). The main food of longfin smelt is opossum shrimp, although copepods and other crustaceans also are eaten (Moyle 1976). Longfin smelt are preyed upon by fishes, birds, and marine mammals (Monaco et al. 1991). Longfin smelt play a role in maintaining the structure and function of estuarine ecosystems because they are important as food for birds and piscivorous fishes.</textblock>
