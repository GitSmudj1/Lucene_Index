    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>One commenter recommends that HCFA not base</textblock>
    <textblock>criteria and standards on the sliding scale of available</textblock>
    <textblock>funding but on true expectations of performance and</textblock>
    <textblock>therefore delete ``changes in fiscal operations due to fiscal</textblock>
    <textblock>constraints'' as a basis for developing criteria and</textblock>
    <textblock>standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>Each year the specific standards are revised</textblock>
    <textblock>and developed in concert with the specific budget and</textblock>
    <textblock>performance requirements, because that is the fiscally</textblock>
    <textblock>responsible approach to develop uniform and fair performance</textblock>
    <textblock>standards for the Medicare contractor community. We will</textblock>
    <textblock>continue to develop standards in conjunction with budget and</textblock>
    <textblock>performance requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>One commenter notes that §§421.124 and</textblock>
    <textblock>421.203 do not include the contract's provision for an</textblock>
    <textblock>extension of the contract, subject to cost limitations.</textblock>
    <textblock>This would deprive high cost contractors of the formal</textblock>
    <textblock>opportunity to choose between accepting limits on their</textblock>
    <textblock>reimbursable costs and losing their Medicare contracts.</textblock>
    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>The contract allows us to offer a high cost</textblock>
    <textblock>contractor the option of submitting a lower budget or losing</textblock>
    <textblock>its Medicare contract. Sections 421.124 and 421.203 would</textblock>
    <textblock>give us the authority to determine the amount which is</textblock>
    <textblock>reasonable and adequate to efficiently and economically</textblock>
    <textblock>operate as an intermediary and carrier. If we determine</textblock>
    <textblock>that we cannot afford to contract with high cost</textblock>
    <textblock>intermediaries or carriers, we may consider appropriate</textblock>
    <textblock>adverse contract action.</textblock>
    <textblock>IV. Provisions of the Final Rule</textblock>
    <textblock>Based on our review of the comments submitted, we are</textblock>
    <textblock>making no substantive changes to the proposed revisions to</textblock>
    <textblock>the rules affecting criteria and standards for evaluating</textblock>
    <textblock>intermediaries and carriers as published on December 3,</textblock>
    <textblock>1992, (57 FR 233). Only minor editorial and technical</textblock>
    <textblock>revisions have been made to the proposed rules.</textblock>
