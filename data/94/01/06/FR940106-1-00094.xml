    <textblock>Appendix III to the Preamble</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix III describes the models used to create and measure the salmon smolt survival indices for the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. These indices and the underlying models represent the state-of-the-art analyses of the factors critical to maintaining habitat conditions necessary to protect cold water fish migration. Nevertheless, as further scientific work is completed and the new data is analyzed in the models, EPA anticipates that the models and indices will be further refined. EPA intends that these refinements be incorporated into the State's criteria during the triennial review process.</textblock>
    <textblock>Derivation of the Sacramento River Index</textblock>
    <textblock>The smolt survival index for fall-run outmigrating smolts in the Sacramento River Delta has been developed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, using coded-wire tagged hatchery-raised smolts released at various locations and under different conditions within the Bay/Delta, and recovered by trawl downstream. The methods are described in USFWS, 1987. Since estimates of total tagged fish in the river cross-section (based on trawl mouth size and time fished) yielded a maximum survival index of nearly 1.8, and the frequency distribution plot of survival indices indicated an approximately normal distribution with a median near 1.0, the indices were divided by 1.8 to provide biologically meaningful survival rates.</textblock>
    <textblock>In order to estimate the benefits of various measures to achieve these indices, a multiple regression smolt survival model was developed for the Sacramento River portion of the Delta. The model, based on tagged smolt releases between 1978 and 1989, is described in Kjelson et al, 1989; a more recent verification and analysis is described in USFWS, 1992a and 1992b. The Sacramento River portion of the Delta was divided into three reaches for survival analysis: (1) The Sacramento River from Sacramento to Walnut Grove, where the Cross-Delta Channel and Georgiana Slough divert water from the main-stem Sacramento River into the central Delta; (2) Walnut Grove to Chipps Island (at the confluence of the Delta river systems) via the central Delta; and (3) Walnut Grove to Chipps Island via the Sacramento River system. Survival indices were converted to mortalities by subtracting from 1.0, and were correlated with ecologically meaningful factors for each reach. Multiple regression analysis was then used to develop equations for each reach which included the significant (p&lt;.05) factors affecting mortality. The equations used to calculate mortality for each reach (as identified above) are:</textblock>
    <textblock>M</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>= ^2.45925 + (0.0420748 * Avg Water Temp,</textblock>
    <textblock>○F, at Freeport, CA), r</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>= .39</textblock>
    <textblock>M</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>= ^0.5916024 + (0.017968 * Avg Water Temp,</textblock>
    <textblock>○F, at Freeport, CA) + (0.0000434 * SWP + CVP Exports), r</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>= .69</textblock>
    <textblock>M</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>= ^1.613493 + (0.0319584 * Avg Water Temp,</textblock>
    <textblock>○F, at Freeport, CA), r</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>= .32</textblock>
    <textblock>Using these equations, USFWS calculated total mortality for the Sacramento River Delta using an adaptation of an approach developed by Ricker (1975) describing the combined effect of two independent sources of mortality occurring sequentially over two distinct time periods:</textblock>
    <textblock>M</textblock>
    <textblock>T</textblock>
    <textblock>= M</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>+ M</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>*P</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>+ M</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>*P</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>^ M</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>*M</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>*P</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>^ M</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>*M</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>*P</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>where P</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>= proportion of Sacramento River flow diverted into the central Delta at Walnut Grove through the Cross-Delta Channel and Georgiana Slough, and P</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>= proportion of Sacramento River flow remaining in the Sacramento River. If, as happens when temperatures are low, the term ``M</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>'' is negative, it will be reset to zero before the computation above is made. Total survival is then calculated as:</textblock>
    <textblock>S</textblock>
    <textblock>T</textblock>
    <textblock>= (1-M</textblock>
    <textblock>T</textblock>
    <textblock>)</textblock>
    <textblock>The USFWS is also estimating survival from recovery of tagged fish in the ocean salmon fishery. The results correlate with the (unadjusted) trawl recovery survival indices (p&lt;0.01; r=0.89; USFWS 1992b), and further increase confidence in the survival indices as a good measure of migration success and habitat conditions.</textblock>
