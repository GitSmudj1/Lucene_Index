    <textblock>42 CFR part 421 is amended as set forth below:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 421_INTERMEDIARIES AND CARRIERS</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 421 continues to read as</textblock>
    <textblock>follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>Secs. 1102, 1815, 1816, 1833, 1834(a) and (h),</textblock>
    <textblock>1842, 1861(u), 1871, 1874, and 1875 of the Social Security Act</textblock>
    <textblock>(42 U.S.C. 1302, 1395g, 1395h, 1395l, 1395m(a) and (h), 1395u,</textblock>
    <textblock>1395x(u), 1395hh, 1395kk, and 1395ll), and 42 U.S.C. 1395b-1.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 421.3 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§421.3</textblock>
    <textblock>Definitions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Intermediary</textblock>
    <textblock>means an entity that has a contract with HCFA</textblock>
    <textblock>to determine and make Medicare payments for Part A or Part B</textblock>
    <textblock>benefits payable on a cost basis (or under the Prospective</textblock>
    <textblock>Payment System for hospitals) and to perform other related</textblock>
    <textblock>functions. For purposes of designating regional or alternative</textblock>
    <textblock>regional intermediaries for home health agencies and of</textblock>
    <textblock>designating intermediaries for hospices under §421.117 as well</textblock>
    <textblock>as for applying the performance criteria in §421.120 and the</textblock>
    <textblock>performance standards in §421.122 and any adverse action</textblock>
    <textblock>resulting from such application, the term intermediary also means</textblock>
    <textblock>a Blue Cross Plan which has entered into a subcontract approved</textblock>
    <textblock>by HCFA with the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association to</textblock>
    <textblock>perform intermediary functions.</textblock>
    <textblock>§421.112</textblock>
    <textblock>[Amended]</textblock>
    <textblock>3. In §421.112(b), ``statistical standards'' is revised to</textblock>
    <textblock>read ``performance standards''.</textblock>
    <textblock>§421.118</textblock>
    <textblock>[Amended]</textblock>
    <textblock>4. In §421.118(b) ``statistical standards'' is revised to</textblock>
    <textblock>read ``performance standards''.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Section 421.122 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§421.122</textblock>
    <textblock>Performance standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>Development of standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition to the</textblock>
    <textblock>performance criteria (§421.120), HCFA develops detailed</textblock>
    <textblock>performance standards for use in evaluating intermediary</textblock>
    <textblock>performance which may be based on historical performance,</textblock>
    <textblock>application of acceptable statistical measures of variation to</textblock>
    <textblock>nationwide intermediary experience during a base period, or</textblock>
    <textblock>changing program emphases or requirements. These standards are</textblock>
    <textblock>also developed considering intermediary experience and evaluate</textblock>
    <textblock>the specific requirements of each functional responsibility or</textblock>
    <textblock>criterion.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Factors beyond intermediary's control.</textblock>
    <textblock>To identify</textblock>
    <textblock>measurable factors that significantly affect an intermediary's</textblock>
    <textblock>performance, but that are not within the intermediary's control,</textblock>
    <textblock>HCFA will_</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Study the performance of intermediaries during the base</textblock>
    <textblock>period, and</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Consider the noncontrollable factors in developing</textblock>
    <textblock>performance standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c)</textblock>
    <textblock>Publication of standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>The development and revision</textblock>
    <textblock>of standards for evaluating intermediary performance is a</textblock>
    <textblock>continuing process. Therefore, before the beginning of each</textblock>
    <textblock>evaluation period, which usually coincides with the Federal</textblock>
    <textblock>fiscal year period of October 1-September 30, HCFA publishes</textblock>
    <textblock>the performance standards as part of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>notice</textblock>
    <textblock>describing the performance criteria issued under §421.120(c).</textblock>
    <textblock>HCFA may not necessarily publish the criteria and standards every</textblock>
    <textblock>year. HCFA interprets the statutory phrase ``before the beginning</textblock>
    <textblock>of each evaluation period'' as allowing publication of the</textblock>
    <textblock>criteria and standards after the Federal fiscal year begins, as</textblock>
    <textblock>long as the evaluation period of the intermediaries for the new</textblock>
    <textblock>criteria and standards begins after the publication of the</textblock>
    <textblock>notice.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. Section 421.124 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§421.124</textblock>
    <textblock>Intermediary's failure to perform efficiently and</textblock>
    <textblock>effectively.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Failure by an intermediary to meet, or to demonstrate</textblock>
    <textblock>the capacity to meet, the criteria or standards specified in</textblock>
    <textblock>§§421.120 and 421.122 may be grounds for adverse action by the</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary or by HCFA, such as reassignment of providers, offer of</textblock>
    <textblock>a short-term agreement, termination of a contract, or non-renewal</textblock>
    <textblock>of a contract. If an intermediary meets all criteria and</textblock>
    <textblock>standards in its overall performance, but does not meet them with</textblock>
    <textblock>respect to a specific provider or class of providers, HCFA may</textblock>
    <textblock>reassign that provider or class of providers to another</textblock>
    <textblock>intermediary in accordance with §421.114.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) In addition, notwithstanding whether an intermediary</textblock>
    <textblock>meets the criteria and standards, if the cost incurred by the</textblock>
    <textblock>intermediary to meet its contractual requirements exceeds the</textblock>
    <textblock>amount which HCFA finds to be reasonable and adequate to meet the</textblock>
    <textblock>cost which must be incurred by an efficiently and economically</textblock>
    <textblock>operated intermediary, those high costs may also be grounds for</textblock>
    <textblock>adverse action.</textblock>
    <textblock>7. In subpart C a new §421.201 is added to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§421.201</textblock>
    <textblock>Performance criteria and standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>Application of performance criteria and standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>As</textblock>
    <textblock>part of the carrier evaluations mandated by section 1842(b)(2) of</textblock>
    <textblock>the Act, HCFA periodically assesses the performance of carriers</textblock>
    <textblock>in their Medicare operations using performance criteria and</textblock>
    <textblock>standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The criteria measure and evaluate carrier performance of</textblock>
    <textblock>functional responsibilities such as_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Accurate and timely payment determinations;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Responsiveness to beneficiary, physician, and supplier</textblock>
    <textblock>concerns; and</textblock>
  </text>
