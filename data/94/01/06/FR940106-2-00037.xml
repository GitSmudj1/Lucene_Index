    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with section 122(i) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act (``CERCLA''), notice is hereby given that a proposed administrative cost recovery settlement concerning the Martin Marietta site in Waterton, Colorado was signed by the EPA Regional Administrator, Region VIII, and issued by the Agency on July 2, 1993. The settlement resolves an EPA claim under section 107 of CERCLA against the Martin Marietta Corporation (``MMC''). By the terms of the proposed Agreement, MMC will pay $875,592.92 to EPA to settle its liability for remaining Past Response Costs. In return, the United States will provide MMC with a covenant not to sue limited to claims for civil liability to the United States arising out of section 107(a) of CERCLA, 42 U.S.C. 9607(a), for reimbursement of the United States' Past Response Costs. ``Past Response Costs'' are defined in the Agreement as any and all response costs, including oversight costs, incurred by the United States in responding to the release or threat of release of hazardous substances from the Site pursuant to CERCLA prior to and including the effective date of the Agreement, and any and all response costs, including oversight, incurred pursuant to Administrative Order on Consent, In the Matter of: Martin Marietta Corporation, Docket Nos. CERCLA 106 VIII-86-2 and RCRA (3008) VIII-86-01. The $875,592.92 figure represents approximately 91 percent of the total amount of Past Response Costs incurred by the United States.</textblock>
