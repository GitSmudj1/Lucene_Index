    <textblock>Three Apalachicola plants were listed as threatened species on May 8, 1992:</textblock>
    <textblock>Euphorbia telephioides</textblock>
    <textblock>(Telephus spurge),</textblock>
    <textblock>Macbridea alba</textblock>
    <textblock>(white birds-in-a-nest), and</textblock>
    <textblock>Scutellaria floridana</textblock>
    <textblock>(Florida skullcap). The fourth species,</textblock>
    <textblock>Pinguicula ionantha</textblock>
    <textblock>(Godfrey's butterwort) was listed as a threatened species on July 12, 1993. These four plants overlap in their distributions and habitats in the low-lying outer Coastal Plain near the Apalachicola River, roughly from the southwestern portion of Apalachicola National Forest west to Panama City. Telephus spurge occupies low sand ridges. White birds-in-a-nest and Florida skullcap occur in grassy pinelands and savannahs; Godfrey's butterwort occurs in savannahs, bogs, and seasonal ponds. Three of the four species occur in Apalachicola National Forest, where ongoing management, especially prescribed burning, is needed to ensure that they are secure. Telephus spurge, which does not occur on public land, and the other species outside of Apalachicola National Forest are threatened by habitat degradation due to lack of prescribed fire and by forestry practices, including planting practices. The recovery plan calls for ensuring that habitat for the three plants is appropriately managed in the National Forest and, to the extent feasible, privately-owned habitat be protected through conservation easements or purchase by public conservation agencies.</textblock>
