    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Trade Policy Staff Committee (TPSC) has initiated a review to determine if Belarus meets the designation criteria of the GSP law and should be designated as a beneficiary. The GSP is provided for in the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2461-2465). The designation criteria are listed in 19 U.S.C. 2462(a), 2462(b) and 2462(c). Interested parties are invited to submit comments regarding the eligibility of Belarus for designation as a GSP beneficiary. The designation criteria mandate determinations related to participation in commodity cartels, preferential treatment provided by beneficiaries to other developed countries, expropriation without compensation, enforcement of arbitral awards, international terrorism, and internationally recognized worker rights. Other practices taken into account include market access for goods and services, investment practices and intellectual property rights.</textblock>
    <textblock>An original and fourteen (14) copies of comments regarding Belarus' eligibility may be submitted, in English, to the Chairman of the GSP Subcommittee, Trade Policy Staff Committee, 600 17th Street, NW., room 517, Washington, DC 20506. Comments must be received no later than 5 p.m. on January 12, 1994.</textblock>
