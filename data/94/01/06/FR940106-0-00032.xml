    <textblock>The Acting Administrator of the DEA hereby certifies that the temporary placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq</textblock>
    <textblock>. This action involves the temporary control of a substance with no currently approved medical use in the United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>The temporary scheduling of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine is not a significant regulatory action for the purposes of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 of September 30, 1993. Drug scheduling matters are not subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) pursuant to the provisions of E.O. 12866, section 3(d)(1). Accordingly, this proposed emergency scheduling action is not subject to provisions of E.O. 12778 which are contingent upon review by OMB. This regulation both responds to an emergency situation posing an imminent hazard to the public safety, and is essential to a criminal law enforcement function of the United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in E.O. 12612, and it has been determined that the temporary placement of 4-bromo-2,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine into Schedule I of the CSA does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</textblock>
