    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule issues technical amendments to Medicare</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations intended to simplify and improve our system for</textblock>
    <textblock>evaluating the performance of fiscal intermediaries and</textblock>
    <textblock>carriers in the administration of the Medicare program.</textblock>
    <textblock>Currently, we evaluate intermediaries using performance</textblock>
    <textblock>criteria and standards announced in an annual notice in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. We are clarifying the methodology for</textblock>
    <textblock>establishing these criteria and standards. For consistency,</textblock>
    <textblock>we establish comparable regulation requirements for the</textblock>
    <textblock>evaluation of carrier performance.</textblock>
    <textblock>These revisions are published in accordance with</textblock>
    <textblock>sections 1816(f) and 1842(b)(2) of the Social Security Act</textblock>
    <textblock>which require us to develop standards, criteria, and</textblock>
    <textblock>procedures to evaluate an intermediary's or carrier's</textblock>
    <textblock>overall performance.</textblock>
  </summary>
  <date>
    <textblock>EFFECTIVE DATE:</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule is effective February 7, 1994.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Under section 1816(a) of the Social Security Act (the</textblock>
    <textblock>Act), public or private organizations and agencies</textblock>
    <textblock>participate in the administration of Part A (Hospital</textblock>
    <textblock>Insurance) of the Medicare program under agreements with the</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS). These</textblock>
    <textblock>agencies or organizations are known as fiscal</textblock>
    <textblock>intermediaries, and they perform bill processing and benefit</textblock>
    <textblock>payment functions for the Medicare program. Under section</textblock>
    <textblock>1842(a) of the Act, the Secretary is authorized to enter</textblock>
    <textblock>into contracts with carriers to fulfill various functions in</textblock>
    <textblock>the administration of Part B (Supplementary Medical</textblock>
    <textblock>Insurance) of the Medicare program. Beneficiaries,</textblock>
    <textblock>physicians and suppliers of the services submit claims to</textblock>
    <textblock>these carriers that, in turn, make appropriate payments.</textblock>
    <textblock>Beginning in 1980 for intermediaries and in 1981 for</textblock>
    <textblock>carriers, we have been evaluating the effectiveness and</textblock>
    <textblock>efficiency of contractor operations through a system of</textblock>
    <textblock>criteria and standards called the Contractor Performance</textblock>
    <textblock>Evaluation Program (CPEP).</textblock>
