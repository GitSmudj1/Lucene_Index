    <textblock>Available Conservation Measures</textblock>
    <textblock>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or</textblock>
    <textblock>threatened under the Endangered Species Act include recognition,</textblock>
    <textblock>recovery actions, requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions</textblock>
    <textblock>against certain activities. Recognition through listing encourages and</textblock>
    <textblock>results in conservation actions by Federal, State, and private agencies,</textblock>
    <textblock>groups, and individuals. The Endangered Species Act provides for</textblock>
    <textblock>possible land acquisition and cooperation with the States and requires</textblock>
    <textblock>that recovery actions be carried out for all listed species. Such</textblock>
    <textblock>actions are initiated by the Service following listing. The protection</textblock>
    <textblock>required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against taking and</textblock>
    <textblock>harm are discussed, in part, below.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to</textblock>
    <textblock>evaluate their actions with respect to any species that is proposed or</textblock>
    <textblock>listed as endangered or threatened and with respect to its critical</textblock>
    <textblock>habitat, if any is being designated. Regulations implementing this</textblock>
    <textblock>interagency cooperation provision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part</textblock>
    <textblock>402. Section 7(a)(4) of the Act requires Federal agencies to confer</textblock>
    <textblock>informally with the Service on any action that is likely to jeopardize</textblock>
    <textblock>the continued existence of a proposed species or result in destruction</textblock>
    <textblock>or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat. If a species is</textblock>
    <textblock>subsequently listed and its critical habitat is designated, section</textblock>
    <textblock>7(a)(2) requires Federal agencies to insure that activities they</textblock>
    <textblock>authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued</textblock>
    <textblock>existence of such a species or to destroy or adversely modify its</textblock>
    <textblock>critical habitat. If a Federal action may affect a listed species or</textblock>
    <textblock>its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agency must enter into</textblock>
    <textblock>consultation with the Service.</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal actions that may affect the splittail or its critical</textblock>
    <textblock>habitat, should any be designated, include those authorized, carried</textblock>
    <textblock>out, or funded by the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation,</textblock>
    <textblock>National Marine Fisheries Service, and EPA. The Army Corps of Engineers</textblock>
    <textblock>funds projects and issues permits for water pumping and diversion</textblock>
    <textblock>facilities, levee construction or repair, bank protection activities,</textblock>
    <textblock>deep-water navigation channel dredging and dredge spoil disposal</textblock>
    <textblock>projects, sand and gravel extraction, marina and bridge construction,</textblock>
    <textblock>diking of wetlands for conversion to farmland, and tidal gate or barrier</textblock>
    <textblock>installation. The Bureau of Reclamation and California Department of</textblock>
    <textblock>Water Resources construct, operate, and/or manage water export</textblock>
    <textblock>facilities. EPA reviews State water quality standards and promulgates</textblock>
    <textblock>replacement standards, pursuant to the Clean Water Act, if State</textblock>
    <textblock>standards are found to be inadequate. In 1991, EPA disapproved portions</textblock>
    <textblock>of the California State Water Resources Control Board's Water Quality</textblock>
    <textblock>Control Plan for Salinity for the San Francisco Bay-Sacramento-San</textblock>
    <textblock>Joaquin Delta Estuary. Accordingly, EPA has published in this same</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>separate part proposed replacement standards for those</textblock>
    <textblock>portions of the State's salinity standards that were disapproved.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under section 4 of the Act, listing the splittail will provide</textblock>
    <textblock>additional impetus for the development of a recovery plan to bring</textblock>
    <textblock>together Federal, State, and private efforts to develop conservation</textblock>
    <textblock>strategies for this species. The Service has convened the Delta Native</textblock>
    <textblock>Fishes Recovery Team to prepare a recovery plan for declining native</textblock>
    <textblock>fishes in the Estuary. The recovery plan will develop a framework for</textblock>
    <textblock>agencies to coordinate activities and cooperate with each other in</textblock>
    <textblock>conservation efforts. The plan will set recovery priorities and</textblock>
    <textblock>estimate the costs of various tasks necessary to accomplish recovery</textblock>
    <textblock>goals. Site-specific management actions necessary to achieve survival</textblock>
    <textblock>and recovery of the splittail and other fishes native to the Estuary</textblock>
    <textblock>ecosystem also will be described in this plan.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.31 set</textblock>
    <textblock>forth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all</textblock>
    <textblock>threatened wildlife not covered by a special rule. These prohibitions,</textblock>
    <textblock>in part, would make it illegal for any person subject to the</textblock>
    <textblock>jurisdiction of the United States to take (including harass, harm,</textblock>
    <textblock>pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, collect, or attempt any</textblock>
    <textblock>such conduct), import or export, transport in interstate or foreign</textblock>
    <textblock>commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale</textblock>
    <textblock>in interstate or foreign commerce any such species. It also is illegal</textblock>
    <textblock>to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife</textblock>
    <textblock>that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions apply to agents of</textblock>
    <textblock>the Service and State conservation agencies.</textblock>
