    <textblock>Conclusion</textblock>
    <textblock>This action affects only PW Model(s) PW4073 and PW4048 turbofan engines. It is not a rule of general applicability and affects only the manufacturer who applied to the FAA for approval of these new design criteria on the engine.</textblock>
    <textblock>List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 33</textblock>
    <textblock>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.</textblock>
    <textblock>The authority citation for these special conditions continues to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421, 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); 14 CFR 21.16, and 14 CFR 11.28.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Proposed Special Conditions</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) proposes the following special conditions as part of the type certification basis for the Pratt &amp; Whitney Model(s) PW4073 and PW4084 turbofan engines.</textblock>
    <textblock>In lieu of the requirements of FAR ยง33.77(a) and (b), the following tests and analyses must be conducted, unless compliance can be shown by alternate methods acceptable to the Administrator:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) It must be shown that the ingestion of a single large bird, under the conditions prescribed in Appendix A, will not cause the engine to:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) catch fire;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) release hazardous fragments through the engine casing;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) generate loads greater than those ultimate loads specified under ยง33.23(a);</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) lose the ability to be shut down; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) generate other conditions hazardous to the aircraft.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Alternatively, if compliance with the bird ingestion requirements of paragraph (a) of this special condition is not established, the applicant must demonstrate that compliance with the containment requirements of ยง33.94(a) constitutes a more severe demonstration than the requirements of paragraph (a) of this special condition. The engine type certification documentation will then be endorsed to reflect this alternative compliance method.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) It must be shown that the ingestion of medium birds, under the conditions prescribed in Appendix B, will not cause the engine to:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Sustain more than a 25 percent thrust loss;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Be shut down during the required run-on demonstration prescribed in Appendix B;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Exceed any engine operating limitations to the extent that the engine cannot comply with this section; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Generate other conditions hazardous to the aircraft.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) It must be shown that engine spinner impact by one large bird and by the single largest medium bird, under the respective conditions prescribed in Appendices A and B, will not affect the engine to the extent that it cannot comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b of this special condition.</textblock>
