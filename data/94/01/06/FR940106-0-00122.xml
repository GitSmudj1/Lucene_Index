    <textblock>In the new interpretations announced in GAL 15-90, section 1430(a) was interpreted as applying to all decisions (i.e., all determinations, redeterminations, and decisions on appeals) made on and after August 23, 1988.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department concluded, and announced in GAL 15-90, that amended section 233(a)(2) should be applied to all decisions rendered on or after August 23, 1988, regardless of whether they involved initial determinations of TRA eligibility, redeterminations, or decisions on appeal.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department also stated in GAL 15-90 that the new interpretation of section 1430(a) is supported by the analysis and construction placed on subsection (g) of section 1430, and by the general principle of law known as the law-in-effect rule. Under the law-in-effect rule, the law to be applied in making any decision is the law in effect at the time the decision is made. In GAL 15-90, this law-in-effect rule was determined to be applicable to the new interpretations and the 1988 Amendments.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subsection (g) of section 1430 provides that the amendment to section 233(a)(2) ``shall not apply with respect to any total separation of a worker *␣*␣* that occurs before the date of enactment of this Act if the application of such amendment with respect to such total separation would reduce the period for which such worker would (but for such amendment) be allowed to receive'' basic TRA. In the proposed rule and in GAL 7-88, section 1430(g) was interpreted as limiting the application of amended section 233(a)(2) to total separations which occurred on or after August 23, 1988, where the result otherwise achieved would be an earlier expiration date of the eligibility period of a worker established on the basis of the prior law and a first qualifying separation which occurred before August 23, 1988.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the new interpretations announced in GAL 15-90, section 1430(g) was interpreted literally as applying only to total separations that occurred before August 23, 1988, and the limitation in section 1430(g) thus applies only to such prior separations.</textblock>
    <textblock>A consequence of this new interpretation of section 1430(g) is that, if the application of amended section 233(a)(2) to a total separation prior to August 23, 1988, would result in extending the worker's eligibility period, the amended section 233(a)(2) shall be applied. Conversely, amended section 233(a)(2) shall be applied to total separations which occur on and after August 23, 1988, regardless of whether it would result in an earlier expiration date of the worker's eligibility period based upon a first qualifying separation which occurred before August 23, 1988.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 1430(g) is not applicable, however, to a ``first qualifying separation'' which occurs before August 23, 1988. It is on the basis of such a first qualifying separation that a worker would have a longer eligibility period ``but for'' the amendment to section 233(a)(2). To preserve a longer eligibility period, and thereby give effect to the limitation in section 1430(g), therefore, such limitation could not logically be made applicable to such a first qualifying separation.</textblock>
    <textblock>A more extensive explanation and justification for the new interpretations affecting amended section 233(a)(2) was set forth in GAL 15-90, and in Attachment A and Section F.1. of GAL 15-90. That explanation and justification was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>, at 55 FR 48774, 48778, 48782, and 48789 (November 21, 1990).</textblock>
    <textblock>The new interpretations require substantive changes in the final rule, particularly in the definitions of ``eligibility period'' and the various types of ``separation'' defined in §§617.3(m) and 617.3(t), as well as in the transition provisions in §617.67. Other conforming changes are made throughout the document, including the deletion of clause (D) in §617.11(a)(2)(iii).</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Other Applications of New Interpretations</textblock>
