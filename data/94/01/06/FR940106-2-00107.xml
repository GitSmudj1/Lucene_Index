    <textblock>Preliminary Finding</textblock>
    <textblock>Wyle Laboratories addressed all of the criteria which must be met for recognition as an NRTL in its initial application and in its further correspondence. For example, the applicant submitted a list of its test equipment and instrumentation; a roster of its personnel including resumes of those in key positions and copies of position descriptions; copies of a typical test report; a factory inspection form and an inspection summary; a summary of its listing, labeling, and follow-up services; a statement of its independence as a testing laboratory; appeals procedure; typical calibration forms; and a copy of its Quality Assurance Manual. This QA Manual includes a description of its document control; identification and control of materials, parts, and components; inspection; test control; control of measuring and test equipment; inspection, test, and operating status; quality assurance records; and audits.</textblock>
    <textblock>Nine major areas were examined in depth during the on-site laboratory evaluation: Facility; test equipment; calibration program; test and evaluation procedures; test reports; records; quality assurance program; follow-up listing program; and personnel.</textblock>
    <textblock>The discrepancies noted during the on-site evaluation were adequately responded to [Ex. 3.A.(2)] prior to the preparation of the final on-site evaluation [Ex. 3. A.(1)]. With the preparation of the final report, the survey team was satisfied that the testing facility appeared to meet the necessary criteria required by the standard, and so noted in the On-Site Review Report (Survey). (See Ex. 3.A.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Following a review of the application file and the on-site survey report of the WL facility, the NRTL Recognition Program staff concluded that the applicant appeared to have met the requirements for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory and, therefore, recommended to the Assistant Secretary that the application be preliminarily approved.</textblock>
    <textblock>Based upon a review of the completed application file and the recommendation of the staff, the Assistant Secretary has made a preliminary finding that Wyle Laboratories can meet the requirements for recognition as required by 29 CFR 1910.7.</textblock>
    <textblock>All interested members of the public are invited to supply detailed reasons and evidence supporting or challenging the sufficiency of the applicant's having met the requirements for recognition as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory, as well as Appendix A, of 29 CFR 1910.7. Submission of pertinent written documents and exhibits shall be made no later than March 7, 1994 and must be addressed to the NRTL Recognition Program, Office of Variance Determination, Room N 3653, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Third Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20210. Copies of the WL application, the laboratory survey report, and all submitted comments, as received, (Docket No. NRTL-1-93), are available for inspection and duplication at the Docket Office, room N 2634, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, at the above address.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Assistant Secretary's final decision on whether the applicant satisfies the requirements for recognition as an NRTL will be made on the basis of the entire record including the public submissions and any further proceedings that the Assistant Secretary may consider appropriate in accordance with Appendix A of ยง1910.7.</textblock>
    <textblock>Signed at Washington, DC this 30th day of December, 1993.</textblock>
