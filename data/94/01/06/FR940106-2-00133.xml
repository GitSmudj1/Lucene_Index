    <textblock>Out of a total of 226 vehicle lines, NHTSA preliminarily determined that the median theft rate for CYs 1990-1991 was 3.6436 thefts per thousand vehicles produced. Of those vehicle lines with a theft rate higher than 3.6436, 90 were passenger car lines, 17 were MPV lines, and 6 were LDT lines.</textblock>
    <textblock>In Table I of the August 1993 document, NHTSA tentatively ranked each of the 226 vehicle lines in descending order of theft rate. Public comment was sought on the accuracy of the data, especially production volumes of individual vehicle lines. Public comment was also sought on the methodology used by NHTSA in determining the ranking of the existing passenger motor vehicle lines.</textblock>
    <textblock>Based on the preliminary data, NHTSA also published a Table III that listed the previously designated high theft lines with theft rates that fell below the preliminary median theft rate of 3.6436. The agency noted that lines that are presently listed in appendix A of 49 CFR part 541 as subject to the requirements of the Theft Prevention Standard will continue to be so listed regardless of whether they fall below the median theft rate. This is because section 603(d) of the Cost Savings Act provides that, except for exemptions from parts marking due to NHTSA-approved antitheft devices, the agency may not ``render the standard inapplicable to any line which at any time has been subject to the standard.''</textblock>
    <textblock>NHTSA explained that in selecting high theft lines based on the 1990/91 median theft rate, it will follow the procedures it established in 49 CFR part 542, Procedures for Selecting Lines to be Covered by the Theft Prevention Standard. The agency indicated that it contemplated that newly designated high theft passenger cars would be required to begin to comply with parts marking requirements in MY 1995, but that compliance for high theft MPV's and LDTs might be delayed to a later model year since determination of ``major parts'' for these vehicles has not yet been made.</textblock>
    <textblock>Public Comments and Agency Response</textblock>
    <textblock>In response to the August 1993</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>document, NHTSA received nine written comments, all from vehicle manufacturers. The commenters addressed four subjects: NHTSA's methodology in calculating the 1990/91 theft rates, the specific preliminary theft data regarding the respective commenter's vehicles, the agency's intention to require that newly designated high theft care lines be marked beginning in model year 1995, and the effect of the 1990/91 theft rates on lines previously determined high theft.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. NHTSA's Methodology in Calculating Rates</textblock>
    <textblock>NHTSA received on comment on its methodology in calculating the new theft rates. Volkswagen of America, Inc. (Volkswagen) stated its belief that ACTA sought to alleviate chop-shop related vehicle thefts. It therefore recommended that only thefts relating to chop-shop activities be counted in determining theft rates.</textblock>
    <textblock>While chop-shop-related thefts may have been Congress' primary concern in enacting the Theft Act, the relevant language in that Act (which remained unaltered in the ACTA) directs NHTSA to calculate the theft rate of a passenger motor vehicle line using a fraction with `` the number of new passenger motor vehicle thefts for that line *␣*␣*'', as the numerator. (See section 603(b)(1).) The statute does not direct the agency to make theft motive distinctions such as those suggested by Volkswagen.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, NHTSA does not believe it appropriate to only use chop-shop related theft data in calculating theft rates for a particular line, or the median theft rates for a particular line, or the median theft rate of all lines. The final data published in this document calculates theft rates for each particular line, using all reported new passenger motor vehicle thefts for that line, in CY 1990 and 1991.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. NHTSA's Calculated Theft Rates of Individual Lines</textblock>
    <textblock>NHTSA received comments from the following seven manufacturers concerning the listing of certain vehicle lines and preliminary data presented in the August 1993 document: Chrysler Corporation (Chrysler), Fiat Auto R&amp;D U.S.A. (Fiat), Ford Motor Company (Ford), Mazda (North America), Inc., Nissan Research and Development, Inc. (Nissan), American Suzuki Motor Corporation (Suzuki), and Volkswagen.</textblock>
