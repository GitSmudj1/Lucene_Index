    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Background Information</textblock>
    <textblock>RCRA section 3001(b)(3) (hereafter referred to as the Bevill Exemption) exempts, among other things, cement kiln dust waste from regulation under RCRA subtitle C, pending completion of a Report to Congress and a subsequent determination of whether such regulation is warranted. In RCRA section 8002(o), Congress directed EPA to conduct a detailed and comprehensive study based on eight study factors (discussed below) and submit a Report to Congress on ``the adverse effects on human health and the environment, if any, of the disposal and utilization of cement kiln dust waste''. RCRA section 3001(b)(3)(C) then requires that EPA determine, within six months of the date of submission of the Report to Congress, either to promulgate regulations for CKD under subtitle C or determine that subtitle C regulation is unwarranted.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Bevill Exemption was added to RCRA on October 12, 1980, as part of the 1980 Solid Waste Disposal Act Amendment. In response to the 1980 RCRA amendments, EPA published an interim final amendment to its hazardous waste regulations to reflect the provisions of the Bevill Exemption (40 CFR 261.4(b)(8)). Since that time, cement kiln dust has remained exempt from subtitle C of RCRA, meaning that this material has never been subject to hazardous waste regulations under Federal law.</textblock>
    <textblock>On March 8, 1989, the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF) filed suit against EPA for failing to complete the RTC as required by RCRA. On June 19, 1991, EPA entered into a proposed consent decree with EDF. In the proposed consent decree, EPA agreed to complete the Report to Congress on Cement Kiln Dust by April 30, 1993. The proposed consent decree was later modified to extend the deadline for issuance of the Report to Congress to December 31, 1993.</textblock>
