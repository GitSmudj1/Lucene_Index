    <textblock>Sampling and examination.</textblock>
    <textblock>The first</textblock>
    <textblock>processor, as described in section 3.a.1. of</textblock>
    <textblock>this Appendix, should subject a</textblock>
    <textblock>representative sample of fish in each lot</textblock>
    <textblock>from the vessel to an external organoleptic</textblock>
    <textblock>examination for decomposition and should</textblock>
    <textblock>record the results of the examination. A</textblock>
    <textblock>representative sample should provide at least</textblock>
    <textblock>95 percent confidence that decomposition does</textblock>
    <textblock>not exist in more than 2.5 percent of the</textblock>
    <textblock>fish in the lot. If the number of fish from</textblock>
    <textblock>a vessel is small enough to permit an</textblock>
    <textblock>examination of each fish, e.g., because the</textblock>
    <textblock>weight of each fish is typically greater than</textblock>
    <textblock>10 pounds, the processor is encouraged to</textblock>
    <textblock>examine each fish.</textblock>
    <textblock>i. Any fish that exhibits decomposition</textblock>
    <textblock>should either be rejected and not used for</textblock>
    <textblock>food, or reconditioned according to the</textblock>
    <textblock>processor's established procedures.</textblock>
    <textblock>Reconditioning should include, at a minimum,</textblock>
    <textblock>removal of all parts of the fish that exhibit</textblock>
    <textblock>any decomposition, organoleptic reexamination</textblock>
    <textblock>of the remaining fish flesh, and the</textblock>
    <textblock>performance of a histamine analysis on the</textblock>
    <textblock>remaining fish flesh.</textblock>
    <textblock>ii. If no decomposition in any fish in</textblock>
    <textblock>a lot is detected through organoleptic</textblock>
    <textblock>examination, the following should apply:</textblock>
    <textblock>A. If the time/temperature log as</textblock>
    <textblock>described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix</textblock>
    <textblock>indicates that the conditions on the vessel</textblock>
    <textblock>were unlikely to cause, or significantly</textblock>
    <textblock>contribute to, the formation of histamine in</textblock>
    <textblock>the fish, all the fish from that lot may be</textblock>
    <textblock>further processed or enter commerce.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. If the time/temperature log as</textblock>
    <textblock>described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix</textblock>
    <textblock>indicates that the conditions on the vessel</textblock>
    <textblock>were likely to cause, or significantly</textblock>
    <textblock>contribute to, the formation of histamine in</textblock>
    <textblock>the fish in a lot, or if no adequate</textblock>
    <textblock>time/temperature log is available, a</textblock>
    <textblock>histamine analysis should be made on a</textblock>
    <textblock>representative sample of fish from that lot.</textblock>
    <textblock>iii. If decomposition is detected in</textblock>
    <textblock>less than 2.5 percent of the fish from a lot,</textblock>
    <textblock>the following should apply:</textblock>
    <textblock>A. If the time/temperature log as</textblock>
    <textblock>described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix</textblock>
    <textblock>indicates that the conditions on the vessel</textblock>
    <textblock>were unlikely to cause, or significantly</textblock>
    <textblock>contribute to, the formation of histamine in</textblock>
    <textblock>the fish in a particular lot, those fish from</textblock>
    <textblock>that lot found to have decomposition should</textblock>
    <textblock>be treated in accordance with section</textblock>
    <textblock>3.a.2.i. of this Appendix. Other fish from</textblock>
    <textblock>that lot may be further processed or enter</textblock>
    <textblock>commerce.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. If the time/temperature log as</textblock>
    <textblock>described in section 3.a.1. of this Appendix</textblock>
    <textblock>indicates that the conditions on the vessel</textblock>
    <textblock>were likely to cause, or significantly</textblock>
    <textblock>contribute to, the formation of histamine in</textblock>
    <textblock>the fish in a particular lot, or if no</textblock>
    <textblock>adequate time/temperature log is available,</textblock>
    <textblock>the processor should perform a histamine</textblock>
    <textblock>analysis on a representative sample of</textblock>
    <textblock>organoleptically acceptable fish from that</textblock>
    <textblock>lot. (However, if the processor elects to</textblock>
    <textblock>perform a histamine analysis on a</textblock>
    <textblock>representative sample of each lot of fish</textblock>
    <textblock>from the vessel before conducting an</textblock>
    <textblock>organoleptic analysis for decomposition</textblock>
    <textblock>because, for example, the processor received</textblock>
    <textblock>the fish in a frozen state, the histamine</textblock>
    <textblock>analysis does not have to be repeated based</textblock>
    <textblock>on results of subsequent organoleptic</textblock>
    <textblock>analysis.)</textblock>
    <textblock>iv. If decomposition is detected in</textblock>
    <textblock>more than 2.5 percent of the fish from a</textblock>
    <textblock>particular lot, the processor should perform</textblock>
    <textblock>a histamine analysis on a representative</textblock>
    <textblock>sample of organoleptically acceptable fish</textblock>
    <textblock>from that lot.</textblock>
    <textblock>3.</textblock>
    <textblock>Histamine Findings.</textblock>
    <textblock>i. If any fish from a particular lot is</textblock>
    <textblock>found to have histamine above a defect action</textblock>
    <textblock>level or other regulatory level or limit for</textblock>
    <textblock>histamine established by FDA, the fish in</textblock>
    <textblock>that lot may not be used for food.</textblock>
    <textblock>ii. If any fish from a particular lot</textblock>
    <textblock>is found to have histamine below the defect</textblock>
    <textblock>action level or other regulatory level or</textblock>
    <textblock>limit for histamine established by FDA but</textblock>
    <textblock>above levels expected of fresh fish, the fish</textblock>
    <textblock>from that lot should enter commerce only if</textblock>
    <textblock>first immediately cooked to prevent histamine</textblock>
    <textblock>from increasing to unacceptable levels.</textblock>
    <textblock>b. Subsequent Processors</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Processor evaluations</textblock>
    <textblock>. All</textblock>
    <textblock>subsequent processors who take ownership of</textblock>
    <textblock>fish and fish products of scombroid toxin</textblock>
    <textblock>forming species and who engage in processing</textblock>
    <textblock>other than, or in addition to, storage,</textblock>
    <textblock>should subject a representative sample each</textblock>
    <textblock>lot of such fish and fishery products to</textblock>
    <textblock>organoleptic evaluation for decomposition to</textblock>
    <textblock>determine whether decomposition occurred</textblock>
    <textblock>during transfer from the previous processor.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any fish that exhibits decomposition should</textblock>
    <textblock>be treated in accordance with section</textblock>
    <textblock>3.a.2.i. of this Appendix.</textblock>
