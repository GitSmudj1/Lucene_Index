    <textblock>B. Preparing for HACCP</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA recognizes that this proposal involves a significant</textblock>
    <textblock>departure from current practices for most processors and</textblock>
    <textblock>importers and intends to work cooperatively with the industry in</textblock>
    <textblock>the establishment of this proposed system. The agency's</textblock>
    <textblock>experiences under both its HACCP-based low acid canned food</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations and the HACCP-based pilot programs for seafood that</textblock>
    <textblock>it conducted with NOAA in 1991 demonstrate the need for</textblock>
    <textblock>cooperation and technical support between the agency and the</textblock>
    <textblock>industry in order to establish HACCP and to make it work.</textblock>
    <textblock>The FDA/NOAA joint pilot programs involved the development</textblock>
    <textblock>and implementation of HACCP-based systems by seafood processors</textblock>
    <textblock>and HACCP-based inspections by the two agencies. Even though the</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA/NOAA pilots involved highly motivated seafood firms that</textblock>
    <textblock>volunteered to adopt HACCP, the firms found it difficult</textblock>
    <textblock>initially to identify hazards and critical control points</textblock>
    <textblock>associated with their own products and processes (Ref. 40). As</textblock>
    <textblock>both the agencies and the firms discovered, HACCP involved new</textblock>
    <textblock>ways of thinking and behaving that were not readily understood or</textblock>
    <textblock>implemented. A considerable amount of consultation and</textblock>
    <textblock>assistance between the firms and the Government proved to be</textblock>
    <textblock>extremely helpful.</textblock>
    <textblock>This experience reinforces the view that regulations that</textblock>
    <textblock>impose a HACCP-based system are needed for the seafood industry</textblock>
    <textblock>and thus represents a third factor supporting the appropriateness</textblock>
    <textblock>of this proposal. The systematic kind of preventive thinking</textblock>
    <textblock>that HACCP requires is not universal, but it can be adopted.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulations will ensure that processors and importers do so.</textblock>
    <textblock>Significantly, once participants in the pilot programs made the</textblock>
    <textblock>transition to HACCP, they were able to identify benefits from</textblock>
    <textblock>using HACCP to themselves and to consumers in terms of product</textblock>
    <textblock>safety and quality, as well as plant sanitation and organization</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 40).</textblock>
    <textblock>VI. International Trade</textblock>
    <textblock>Although not a public health issue, international trade is</textblock>
    <textblock>also a major consideration in determining the advisability and</textblock>
    <textblock>benefits of a new system of seafood regulation and therefore will</textblock>
    <textblock>be addressed here. It is estimated that close to 40 percent of</textblock>
    <textblock>the fish and shellfish harvested from the world's oceans, lakes,</textblock>
    <textblock>and other bodies of water entered international trade in 1991</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 41). This movement reflects the need to match supplies</textblock>
    <textblock>with demand. Nations often have species in their waters for</textblock>
    <textblock>which there is little or no demand among their consumers, while</textblock>
    <textblock>consumers in other countries may prefer these species. In</textblock>
    <textblock>addition, sometimes foreign markets are willing to pay higher</textblock>
    <textblock>prices than domestic markets.</textblock>
    <textblock>Participation in the international trade in seafood is</textblock>
    <textblock>critical to U.S. consumers and industry. Approximately 55</textblock>
    <textblock>percent of the U.S. supply of edible seafood is imported. In</textblock>
    <textblock>1991, 3,014,819,000 pounds were imported, worth $5,617,887,000,</textblock>
    <textblock>making the United States the world's second largest seafood</textblock>
    <textblock>importing nation (Ref. 42).</textblock>
