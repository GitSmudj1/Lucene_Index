    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On May 28, 1993, the USTR initiated an investigation of deficiencies in the acts, policies and practices of the Government of Brazil (Brazil) related to the denial of adequate and effective protection of intellectual property rights in Brazil. See 58 FR 31788 (June 4, 1993). Since that time, four rounds of bilateral discussions have been held to resolve these issues.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the context of these discussions, the Government of Brazil indicated that it has undertaken and will undertake as part of its domestic reform efforts a number of actions to improve the protection of intellectual property in Brazil, and to provide greater market access for products relying on the protection of intellectual property. These include progress in the areas of protection for trademarks, semiconductor mask works (layout designs), and computer programs; market access for computer programs; and improvements in the enforcement of intellectual property rights, including efforts regarding the importation of pirated and counterfeit goods and the penalties of infringement of intellectual property rights.</textblock>
