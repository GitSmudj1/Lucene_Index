    <textblock>4. Special Considerations.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the cooking of blue crab</textblock>
    <textblock>(Callinectes sapidus</textblock>
    <textblock>), dungeness crab (</textblock>
    <textblock>Cancer</textblock>
    <textblock>magister</textblock>
    <textblock>), or king crab (</textblock>
    <textblock>Paralithodes</textblock>
    <textblock>camtschatica</textblock>
    <textblock>), the known lethality of the</textblock>
    <textblock>cooking process necessary to make the product</textblock>
    <textblock>generally acceptable for human consumption,</textblock>
    <textblock>or to enable further processing, is</textblock>
    <textblock>sufficient so that the adequacy of the</textblock>
    <textblock>process and the equipment can normally be</textblock>
    <textblock>assumed.</textblock>
    <textblock>b. Pasteurization</textblock>
    <textblock>1.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Pasteurization Process.</textblock>
    <textblock>The</textblock>
    <textblock>processor must be able to demonstrate to</textblock>
    <textblock>itself and to FDA that its pasteurization</textblock>
    <textblock>process ensures the adequate reduction of</textblock>
    <textblock>numbers of viable spores of microorganisms of</textblock>
    <textblock>public health concern. One way to accomplish</textblock>
    <textblock>this is to have a pasteurization process that</textblock>
    <textblock>is equivalent to a process established by a</textblock>
    <textblock>process authority. To demonstrate</textblock>
    <textblock>equivalence, a processor should have on file</textblock>
    <textblock>in its HACCP records a document that:</textblock>
    <textblock>i. Describes the results of a</textblock>
    <textblock>scientific evaluation conducted by a process</textblock>
    <textblock>authority of the adequacy of the</textblock>
    <textblock>pasteurization process; and that</textblock>
    <textblock>ii. Identifies and establishes values</textblock>
    <textblock>for those key aspects of the process, or of</textblock>
    <textblock>the product, that may affect the adequate</textblock>
    <textblock>reduction in numbers of microorganisms of</textblock>
    <textblock>public health concern. At a minimum, these</textblock>
    <textblock>values should include pasteurization times</textblock>
    <textblock>and temperatures.</textblock>
    <textblock>Such document may consist of, but should</textblock>
    <textblock>not be limited to, a letter from a process</textblock>
    <textblock>authority, articles in scientific journals,</textblock>
    <textblock>or Federal, State or local government</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations or advisories. Failure to have</textblock>
    <textblock>documentation that the pasteurization process</textblock>
    <textblock>will achieve its goal will violate 21 CFR</textblock>
    <textblock>123.8 and will mean that the product produced</textblock>
    <textblock>by the processor will be produced under</textblock>
    <textblock>insanitary conditions whereby it may be</textblock>
    <textblock>rendered injurious to health.</textblock>
    <textblock>2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pasteurization Equipment Design.</textblock>
    <textblock>i. The processor must be able to</textblock>
    <textblock>demonstrate to itself and to FDA that its</textblock>
    <textblock>pasteurization equipment can deliver the</textblock>
    <textblock>pasteurization process that ensures the</textblock>
    <textblock>adequate reduction of viable spores of</textblock>
    <textblock>microorganisms of public health concern. One</textblock>
    <textblock>way to accomplish this is to have on file a</textblock>
    <textblock>document that describes the results of a</textblock>
    <textblock>scientific evaluation conducted by a process</textblock>
    <textblock>authority, of the design and operation of the</textblock>
    <textblock>type of equipment used by the processor. The</textblock>
    <textblock>engineering specifications for the equipment</textblock>
    <textblock>used by the processor (e.g., pipe sizes, flow</textblock>
    <textblock>rates, loading configuration) should meet or</textblock>
    <textblock>exceed those for the equipment evaluated by</textblock>
    <textblock>the process authority. Failure to have</textblock>
    <textblock>documentation that the pasteurization</textblock>
    <textblock>equipment will achieve its goals will violate</textblock>
    <textblock>21 CFR 123.8 and will mean that the product</textblock>
    <textblock>produced by the processor will be produced</textblock>
    <textblock>under insanitary conditions whereby it may be</textblock>
    <textblock>rendered injurious to health.</textblock>
    <textblock>ii. Pasteurization equipment should be</textblock>
    <textblock>equipped with both a temperature-indicating</textblock>
    <textblock>device and temperature-recording device. The</textblock>
    <textblock>temperature-indicating device should be the</textblock>
    <textblock>reference instrument for determining</textblock>
    <textblock>conformance to the established process</textblock>
    <textblock>temperatures.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Records.</textblock>
    <textblock>Monitoring records made by the processor should record the actual values</textblock>
    <textblock>that are occurring for those key aspect of</textblock>
    <textblock>the process identified by the process</textblock>
    <textblock>authority in section 4.b.1.ii of this</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Container Integrity Critical Controls Points</textblock>
    <textblock>a. Finished Product Container Sealing</textblock>
    <textblock>Finished product containers must be</textblock>
    <textblock>inspected, and the results recorded, for</textblock>
    <textblock>container integrity to assure a consistently</textblock>
    <textblock>reliable hermetic seal. FDA recommends that:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Visual seam inspection of one</textblock>
    <textblock>container from each seaming head occur every</textblock>
    <textblock>30 minutes; and</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Testing by qualified personnel of</textblock>
    <textblock>one container from each seaming head occur at</textblock>
    <textblock>least every 4 hours. As applicable, these</textblock>
    <textblock>tests should be performed in accordance with</textblock>
    <textblock>21 CFR 113.60(a)(1) and (a)(2).</textblock>
    <textblock>b. Post-pasteurization Cooling</textblock>
    <textblock>Container cooling water must contain a</textblock>
    <textblock>measurable residual of chlorine or other</textblock>
    <textblock>sanitizer. Tests to determine the presence</textblock>
    <textblock>of a measurable residual of chlorine or other</textblock>
    <textblock>sanitizer in the container cooling water</textblock>
    <textblock>should be made, and the results recorded, at</textblock>
    <textblock>sufficient frequency to ensure control.</textblock>
