    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Organization, Mission and Goals of the Family and Youth Services Bureau</textblock>
    <textblock>The Family and Youth Services Bureau (FYSB) is a component of the Administration on Children, Youth and Families (ACYF) in the Administration for Children and Families (ACF). The Bureau administers five Federal programs dealing with children, youth and families:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The Runaway and Homeless Youth (Basic Center) Program (RHYP),</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth (TLP),</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) The Drug Abuse Prevention Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth (DAPP),</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) The Youth Gang Drug Prevention Program (YGDPP), and</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) The Family Resource and Support Program (FRSP).</textblock>
    <textblock>The mission of FYSB is to provide national leadership on youth issues and to empower individuals and organizations to provide effective, comprehensive services for at-risk youth and their families, ensuring the safety and maximizing the stability and long-term self-sufficiency of the youth.</textblock>
    <textblock>Two of the FYSB programs listed above, the Runaway and Homeless Youth (Basic Center) Program and the Transitional Living Program for Homeless Youth, are authorized under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (Title III of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974, as amended, hereinafter cited as ``the Act'') and are the subject of the priorities proposed in this notice.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Act specifically authorizes the Secretary to make grants to entities that establish and operate local runaway and homeless youth centers (Basic Centers) to address the immediate needs of at-risk youth. Currently, 348 such projects are being funded. The Act also authorizes activities that support the local centers, and that increase knowledge about the conditions of runaway and homeless youth and their families.</textblock>
