    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of this notice is to announce the proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell and Utilities, which adopts Draft International Standard ISO/IEC 9945-2:1992, Information Technology_Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX)_Part 2: Shell and Utilities as a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS). ISO/IEC 9945-2:1992, which defines a command language interpreter (shell) and a set of utility programs, is expected to be approved as an International Standard (IS) in 1994. The FIPS will adopt the final IS after it is approved.</textblock>
    <textblock>Prior to the submission of the proposed FIPS to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval, it is essential to assure that consideration is given to the needs and views of manufacturers, the public, and State and local governments. The purpose of this notice is to solicit such views.</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed FIPS contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with the technical requirements of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications (ISO/IEC 9945-2) from the IEEE Service Center, 445 Hoes Lane, P.O. Box 1331, Piscataway, NJ 08855-1331, telephone 1-800-678-4333.</textblock>
