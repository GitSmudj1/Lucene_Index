    <textblock>5. Policy.</textblock>
    <textblock>No fees will be charged for entrance to any Corps operated area. Fees will be charged for the use of developed day use recreation facilities provided by the Corps, as prescribed below and shown in Appendix C.</textblock>
    <textblock>a.</textblock>
    <textblock>General.</textblock>
    <textblock>Day user fees will be charged for the use of Corps operated day use facilities which meet the requirements described below.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Fees will be charged for the use of certain boat launching ramps and designated, developed swimming beaches in Corps operated day use recreation areas. Fees will not be charged for drinking water, wayside exhibits, roads, scenic drives, overlook sites, picnic tables, toilet facilities, surface water areas, undeveloped or lightly developed shoreland, or general visitor information. Day user fees will not be charged for the use of visitor centers.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Day user fees will be charged only where there is reasonable expectation that revenues will significantly exceed costs of collection, to include implementation costs. Estimates of annual revenue from a fee facility must exceed annual estimated cost to collect, including the cost of implementation amortized over the design life of the improvements, by 10% or $3,000, whichever is greater. The estimate should be reviewed periodically by Division Commanders to determine the justification for modifying the project fee collection program.</textblock>
    <textblock>b.</textblock>
    <textblock>Boat Launch User Fee.</textblock>
    <textblock>A day user fee of $2.00 will be charged to launch a boat at a ramp in a Corps operated day use recreation area, provided that the net revenue test in paragraph 5.a.(2) is met.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The fee will be charged at recreation areas having a boat ramp and one or more of the following facilities: restrooms, security lighting, picnicking facilities, swimming facilities, or other developed recreation facilities. The boat launch fee will not be charged at boat ramps located in recreation areas which are exclusively campgrounds and reserved exclusively for the use of campers, or in recreation areas which provide only a boat ramp and courtesy dock.</textblock>
