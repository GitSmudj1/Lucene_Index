    <textblock>The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Martinka Coal Company</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. M-94-01-C]</textblock>
    <textblock>Martinka Coal Company, 750 Levels Road, Fairmont, West Virginia 26554, has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(2) (weekly examination) to its Tygart River Mine (I.D. No. 46-03805) located in Marion County, West Virginia. Due to hazardous roof conditions, certain areas of the mine cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to establish evaluation points to monitor for methane and quantity of air in the affected areas. Petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. T &amp; T Energy, Inc.</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. M-94-02-C]</textblock>
    <textblock>T &amp; T Energy, Inc., P.O. Box 206, Bruceton Mills, West Virginia 26525, has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.380(d)(3) and (4) (escapeways; bituminous and lignite mines) to its Mine No. 1 (I.D. No. 46-01822) located in Preston County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to leave the affected area undisturbed, stating that the area has been used for ten years without a problem and that compliance with the standard would result in a diminution of safety. Petitioner asserts that the miners are guaranteed no less than the same measure of protection as would be provided by the mandatory standard.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Peabody Coal Company</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. M-94-03-C]</textblock>
    <textblock>Peabody Coal Company, 1951 Barrett Court, P.O. Box 1990, Henderson, Kentucky 42420-1990, has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(4) (weekly examination) to its Camp No. 1 Mine (I.D. No. 15-02709) located in Union County, Kentucky. Due to hazardous roof conditions, certain areas of the mine cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to monitor for methane and quantity of air in the affected areas and asserts that this proposed alternative would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Consolidation Coal Company</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. M-94-04-C]</textblock>
    <textblock>Consolidation Coal Company, Consol Plaza, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241-1421, has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(c)(2) (weekly examination) to its Osage No. 3 Mine (I.D. No. 46-01455) located in Monogalia County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorated conditions, certain areas of the mine cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to establish evaluation points to monitor for methane and quantity of air in the affected areas. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Trent Coal, Inc.</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. M-94-05-C)</textblock>
    <textblock>Trent Coal, Inc., 600 Grant Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15219, has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.380(f) (escapeways; bituminous and lignite mines) to its Rice No. 2 Mine (I.D. No. 36-03636) located in Cambria County, Pennsylvania. Due to the size of the electric golf carts used in the primary escapeway and the relative size of fire suppression systems, these golf carts would not be able to operate satisfactorily with such a system. The petitioner proposes to construct the golf carts of fire-resistant material, protect the battery/motor circuit by a fuse, perform all battery charging on the surface, and provide all golf carts with a multipurpose dry chemical fire extinguisher. Petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. Eldorado Chemical Co.</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. M-94-01-M]</textblock>
    <textblock>Eldorado Chemical Company, P.O. Box 419082, St. Louis, Missouri 63141-1782, has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 56.6309 (fuel oil requirements for ANFO) to its Martiki Mine (I.D. No. 15-07295) located in Marion County, Kentucky. The petitioner proposes to implement a ``recycled used oil/ANFO mixture operation'' at the mine site and states that the product would parallel that of a conventional Ammonium Nitrate/No. 2 diesel fuel conventional ANFO blasting agent product.</textblock>
