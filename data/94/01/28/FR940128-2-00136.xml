    <textblock>In sentence four cases, the filing period begins after the final judgment (``affirming, modifying, or reversing'') is entered by the court and the appeal period has run, so that the judgment is no longer appealable *␣*␣*. In sentence six cases, the filing period does not begin until after the postremand proceedings are completed, the Secretary returns to court, the court enters a final judgment, and the appeal period runs. 501 U.S. at</textblock>
    <textblock>XXX</textblock>
    <textblock>, 111 S.Ct., at 2165.</textblock>
    <textblock>Schaefer raises two arguments that merit further discussion. The first is based on our decision in</textblock>
    <textblock>Sullivan</textblock>
    <textblock>v.</textblock>
    <textblock>Hudson,</textblock>
    <textblock>490 U.S. 877, 892, 109 S.Ct. 2248, 2257, 104 L.Ed.2d 941, (1989), which held that fees incurred during administrative proceedings held pursuant to a district court's remand order could be recovered under EAJA. In order ``to effectuate</textblock>
    <textblock>Hudson,</textblock>
    <textblock>'' Schaefer contends, a district court entering a sentence-four remand order may properly hold its judgment in abeyance (and thereby delay the start of EAJA's 30-day clock) until postremand administrative proceedings are complete; otherwise, as far as fees incurred during the yet-to-be-held administrative proceedings are concerned, the claimant would be unable to comply with the requirement of section 2412(d)(1)(B) that the fee application include ``the amount sought'' and ``an itemized statement *␣*␣* [of] the actual time expended'' by attorneys and experts. In response, the Secretary argues that</textblock>
    <textblock>Hudson</textblock>
    <textblock>applies only to cases remanded pursuant to sentence six of section 405(g), where there is no final judgment and the clock does not begin to run. The difficulty with that, Schaefer contends, is that</textblock>
    <textblock>Hudson itself</textblock>
    <textblock>clearly involved a sentence-four remand.</textblock>
    <textblock>On the last point, Schaefer is right. Given the facts recited by the Court in</textblock>
    <textblock>Hudson</textblock>
    <textblock>, the remand order there could have been authorized only under sentence four. See 490 U.S., at 880-881, 109 S.Ct.,at 2252; cf. n. 2,</textblock>
    <textblock>supra.</textblock>
    <textblock>However, the facts in</textblock>
    <textblock>Hudson</textblock>
    <textblock>also show that the District Court had not terminated the case, but had retained jurisdiction during the remand. And that was a central element in our decision, as the penultimate sentence of the opinion shows:</textblock>
    <textblock>We conclude that where a court orders a remand to the Secretary in a benefits litigation</textblock>
    <textblock>and retains continuing jurisdiction over the case pending a decision from the Secretary which will determine the claimant's entitlement to benefits,</textblock>
    <textblock>the proceedings on remand are an integral part of the ``civil action'' for judicial review, and thus attorney's fees for representation on remand are available subject to the other limitations in the EAJA. 490 U.S., at 892, 109 S.Ct., at 2258 (emphasis added).</textblock>
