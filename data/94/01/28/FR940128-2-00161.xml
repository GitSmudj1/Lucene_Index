    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of the land exchange is to allow BLM to acquire riparian land which is in good condition and identified as prime bald eagle habitat. The public land selected by the proponent would enhance his livestock operation and is currently difficult for BLM to manage because of the land pattern. The exchange is consistent with the Bureau of Land Management land use plans, and the public interest will be well served by making this exchange. The exchange will include surface and mineral estates.</textblock>
    <textblock>The federal and non-federal lands were appraised at equal fair market value.</textblock>
    <textblock>The exchange will be subject to:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. All valid existing rights, including any right-of-way easement, permit or lease of record.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. A reservation to the United States of a right-of-way for ditches and canals constructed by the authority of the United States under the Act of August 30, 1890 (43 U.S.C. 945).</textblock>
    <textblock>For a period of 45 days from the date of publication of this notice in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>, interested parties may submit comments to the District Manager at the above address. Objections will be reviewed by the State Director who may sustain, vacate, or modify this realty action. In the absence of any objections, this realty action will become final determination of the Department of the Interior.</textblock>
