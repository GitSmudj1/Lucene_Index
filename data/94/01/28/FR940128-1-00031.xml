    <textblock>In addition, seafood trade associations, university Sea</textblock>
    <textblock>Grant extension offices, and others have already developed work</textblock>
    <textblock>sheets and other aids to facilitate HACCP planning for seafood.</textblock>
    <textblock>Industry members are encouraged to contact their trade</textblock>
    <textblock>associations and state universities or Sea Grant extension</textblock>
    <textblock>offices on such matters.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Effective Date</textblock>
    <textblock>Even with these forms of assistance, however, FDA recognizes</textblock>
    <textblock>that HACCP plans cannot be written and implemented overnight. As</textblock>
    <textblock>has already been discussed, the HACCP system of controls can</textblock>
    <textblock>involve new ways of thinking and performing on a routine basis.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consequently, FDA is proposing that these regulations will become</textblock>
    <textblock>effective 1 year after issuance of the final rule in this</textblock>
    <textblock>proceeding. The agency has tentatively concluded that this</textblock>
    <textblock>period of time is sufficient to permit the development and</textblock>
    <textblock>implementation of HACCP plans by the industry. FDA specifically</textblock>
    <textblock>invites comment on whether 1 year will be adequate. The agency's</textblock>
    <textblock>objective is to provide enough time to permit processors and</textblock>
    <textblock>importers to understand HACCP, analyze the relevant hazards, and</textblock>
    <textblock>develop an appropriate HACCP plan, but also to avoid unnecessary</textblock>
    <textblock>delay.</textblock>
    <textblock>After the proposed effective date, inspection of HACCP plans</textblock>
    <textblock>will occur as part of routine, mandatory plant inspections and</textblock>
    <textblock>import examinations. FDA is not proposing to require that HACCP</textblock>
    <textblock>plans be submitted to FDA in advance, or that preapproval by FDA</textblock>
    <textblock>be a condition of their adoption or implementation. FDA is not</textblock>
    <textblock>requiring preapproval for two reasons. First, HACCP plans can</textblock>
    <textblock>only properly be judged in the context of the facility itself.</textblock>
    <textblock>Thus, while FDA investigators will consider the adequacy of the</textblock>
    <textblock>plan during their inspections, preapproval does not seem</textblock>
    <textblock>warranted. Second, the agency simply does not have the resources</textblock>
    <textblock>to make preapproval a requirement. Given the protections that</textblock>
    <textblock>are built into the HACCP approach, FDA tentatively finds that</textblock>
    <textblock>preapproval is not necessary to ensure that fish and fishery</textblock>
    <textblock>products are not produced under conditions whereby they may be</textblock>
    <textblock>adulterated under section 402(a)(4) of the act.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Location and Product Type</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing in ยง123.6(a) to require that every</textblock>
    <textblock>processor and importer have and implement an HACCP plan that is</textblock>
    <textblock>specific both to each location where that processor engages in</textblock>
    <textblock>processing and to each kind of fish and fishery product being</textblock>
    <textblock>processed. A plan should be specific to each location because</textblock>
    <textblock>the likely hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and</textblock>
    <textblock>monitoring procedures can vary from one facility to the next</textblock>
    <textblock>depending on such factors as type of equipment, conditions and</textblock>
    <textblock>procedures, and location. A plan also should be specific to each</textblock>
    <textblock>type of fish and fishery product for the same kinds of reasons.</textblock>
    <textblock>Hazards can vary depending on species, location of catch, and</textblock>
    <textblock>other factors.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA does not intend, however, to require a processor or</textblock>
    <textblock>importer to write a separate plan, or separate part of a plan,</textblock>
    <textblock>for each fish and fishery product it handles if the likely</textblock>
    <textblock>hazards, critical control points, critical limits, and monitoring</textblock>
    <textblock>procedures are identical for each of them. For example, the</textblock>
    <textblock>preventive controls necessary to ensure safety for most deep</textblock>
    <textblock>water species of finfish from the north Atlantic may be virtually</textblock>
    <textblock>identical. The agency has tentatively concluded that, in such</textblock>
    <textblock>cases, a processor or importer may group the fish or fish</textblock>
    <textblock>products together in an HACCP plan.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Safety Hazards Only</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing to require at ยง123.6(b)(1) that HACCP</textblock>
    <textblock>plans identify the human food safety hazards that must be</textblock>
    <textblock>controlled for each fish and fishery product being processed by a</textblock>
    <textblock>processor or importer. There exists a range of opinion on</textblock>
    <textblock>whether HACCP should apply solely to safety hazards, as this</textblock>
    <textblock>provision proposes to require, or whether HACCP should apply to</textblock>
    <textblock>other types of hazards, such as decomposition not normally</textblock>
    <textblock>associated with illness in humans. One school of thought holds</textblock>
    <textblock>that HACCP should apply to safety hazards only in order to keep</textblock>
    <textblock>it focused and to not overwhelm operators with an unnecessarily</textblock>
    <textblock>large number of critical control points that have no bearing on</textblock>
    <textblock>the primary concern of safety. Another view holds that, for</textblock>
    <textblock>seafood at least, HACCP-type controls can be applied to various</textblock>
    <textblock>consumer risks without generating an excessive number of critical</textblock>
    <textblock>control points. The Codex Committee on Food Hygiene came to the</textblock>
    <textblock>latter conclusion (Ref. 46), as did NOAA as a result of its</textblock>
    <textblock>experiences during the MSSP (Ref. 35, p. 70). Partly for that</textblock>
    <textblock>reason, the FDA/NOAA HACCP pilot programs involved HACCP controls</textblock>
    <textblock>for safety and HACCP-type controls for other hazards as well.</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of these proposed regulations, however, FDA's</textblock>
    <textblock>application of HACCP is intended for the efficient enforcement of</textblock>
    <textblock>section 402(a)(1) and 402(a)(4) of the act, which applies to</textblock>
    <textblock>products that contain substances that may render the product</textblock>
    <textblock>injurious to health and to processing conditions that are</textblock>
    <textblock>insanitary and that could render a product injurious to health.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consequently, FDA is proposing to require that HACCP plans</textblock>
    <textblock>include identification of hazards that could affect human food</textblock>
    <textblock>safety only. To facilitate the production of such plans, FDA has</textblock>
    <textblock>listed in proposed ยง123.6(b)(1) the types of hazards that have</textblock>
    <textblock>been associated with seafood (see section II.C. of this document</textblock>
    <textblock>for a discussion of these hazards). All of these hazards are</textblock>
    <textblock>identified and discussed in the NAS report on seafood safety</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 7).</textblock>
