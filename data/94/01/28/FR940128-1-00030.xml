  <text>
    <textblock>All of these requirements reflect the HACCP principles</textblock>
    <textblock>developed by NACMCF.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is not proposing to require that the HACCP plan be</textblock>
    <textblock>signed by any official of a company, but invites comment on the</textblock>
    <textblock>merits of such a requirement in the final regulations as a means</textblock>
    <textblock>of both ensuring and demonstrating formal adoption of the plan by</textblock>
    <textblock>that company. FDA also invites comment on who in the firm would</textblock>
    <textblock>be the appropriate individual to sign the plan.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Guidelines and Other Assistance</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA recognizes that HACCP plans will vary in complexity,</textblock>
    <textblock>from those having many critical control points, such as plans for</textblock>
    <textblock>multicomponent, ready-to-eat products, to those having only a few</textblock>
    <textblock>critical control points, such as a plan for a fish filleting</textblock>
    <textblock>plant. Plan development can be facilitated by technical</textblock>
    <textblock>assistance from many sources and by the detailed advice provided</textblock>
    <textblock>in the literature. NACMCF, for example, has recommended that, to</textblock>
    <textblock>facilitate the development of HACCP plans, processors should</textblock>
    <textblock>create an HACCP team, identify the intended use and likely</textblock>
    <textblock>consumers of the food, and prepare a flow diagram of the entire</textblock>
    <textblock>manufacturing process to help identify critical control points.</textblock>
    <textblock>The agency favors simplicity and the rapid development of</textblock>
    <textblock>HACCP plans without undue expense. The appendices at the end of</textblock>
    <textblock>the proposed regulations are intended to facilitate plan</textblock>
    <textblock>development by setting forth certain critical control points,</textblock>
    <textblock>critical limits, controls, and records that, if incorporated into</textblock>
    <textblock>or prepared under a HACCP plan, would be acceptable to the agency</textblock>
    <textblock>for the types of products mentioned. To further facilitate the</textblock>
    <textblock>development of HACCP plans, FDA intends to issue separate HACCP</textblock>
    <textblock>guidance for seafood that will provide information on hazards and</textblock>
    <textblock>appropriate controls by species and by product type.</textblock>
    <textblock>The guidance will provide a broad spectrum of information</textblock>
    <textblock>from which firms will be able to identify likely hazards and</textblock>
    <textblock>critical control points that apply to them. The agency believes</textblock>
    <textblock>that the number of critical control points will range, roughly,</textblock>
    <textblock>between 2 and 12 per product.</textblock>
    <textblock>The guidance will also contain a fill-in-the-blank type of</textblock>
    <textblock>HACCP plan with instructions on how to complete the plan based on</textblock>
    <textblock>information in the guidance. The agency has tentatively</textblock>
    <textblock>concluded that a plan that follows this model is likely to be</textblock>
    <textblock>acceptable to FDA. The agency is including samples of the</textblock>
    <textblock>guidance it is developing in Appendix 1 to this document. FDA</textblock>
    <textblock>intends to issue a separate draft guidance document for public</textblock>
    <textblock>comment and to make the completed guidance available to the</textblock>
    <textblock>public at the time that the regulations are finalized.</textblock>
