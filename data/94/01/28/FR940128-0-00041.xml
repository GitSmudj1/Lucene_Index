    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule identifies communities participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). These communities have applied to the program and have agreed to enact certain floodplain management measures. The communities' participation in the program authorizes the sale of flood insurance to owners of property located in the communities listed.</textblock>

  </date>
  <address>
    <textblock>ADDRESSES:</textblock>
    <textblock>Flood insurance policies for property located in the communities listed can be obtained from any licensed property insurance agent or broker serving the eligible community, or from the NFIP at: Post Office Box 457, Lanham, MD 20706, (800) 638-7418.</textblock>

    <textblock>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</textblock>
    <textblock>Robert F. Shea, Division Director, Program Implementation Division, Mitigation Directorate, 500 C Street, SW., room 417, Washington, DC 20472, (202) 646-3619.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The NFIP enables property owners to purchase flood insurance which is generally not otherwise available. In return, communities agree to adopt and administer local floodplain management aimed at protecting lives and new construction from future flooding. Since the communities on the attached list have recently entered the NFIP, subsidized flood insurance is now available for property in the community.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency has identified the special flood hazard areas in some of these communities by publishing a Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM) or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The date of the flood map, if one has been published, is indicated in the fourth column of the table. In the communities listed where a flood map has been published, Section 102 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, 42 U.S.C. 4012(a), requires the purchase of flood insurance as a condition of Federal or federally related financial assistance for acquisition or construction of buildings in the special flood hazard areas shown on the map.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Director finds that the delayed effective dates would be contrary to the public interest. The Director also finds that notice and public procedure under 5 U.S.C. 553(b) are impracticable and unnecessary.</textblock>
    <textblock>National Environmental Policy Act</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule is categorically excluded from the requirements of 44 CFR Part 10, Environmental Considerations. No environmental impact assessment has been prepared.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The Deputy Associate Director certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities in accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U. S. C. 601</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>, because the rule creates no additional burden, but lists those communities eligible for the sale of flood insurance.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory Impact Analysis</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule is not a major rule under Executive Order 11291, Federal Regulation, February 17, 1981, 3 CFR, 1981 Comp., p. 127. No regulatory impact analysis has been prepared.</textblock>
    <textblock>Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule does not involve any collection of information for purposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12612, Federalism</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule involves no policies that have federalism implications under Executive Order 12612, Federalism, October 26, 1987, 3 CFR, 1987 Comp., p. 252.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule meets the applicable standards of section 2(b)(2) of Executive Order 12778, October 25, 1991, 56 FR 55195, 3 CFR, 1991 Comp., p. 309.</textblock>
