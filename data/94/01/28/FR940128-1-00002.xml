    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule would change the boundaries of five of the seven districts established under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) to apportion membership on the National Watermelon Promotion Board (Board). This action is necessary to reflect shifts in production since the original districts were established. The Plan requires the periodic realignment of the districts based on shifts in production to ensure equitable representation of producers and handlers on the Board.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule is issued under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Plan (Plan) (7 CFR part 1210). The Plan is authorized under the Watermelon Research and Promotion Act (7 U.S.C. 4901-4916), hereinafter referred to as the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. It is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 1650 of the Act, a person subject to the Plan may file a petition with the Secretary stating that the Plan or any provision of the Plan, or any obligation imposed in connection with the Plan, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the Plan or an exemption from the Plan. The petitioner is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After such hearing, the Secretary will make a ruling on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the United States in any district in which a person who is a petitioner resides or carries on business are vested with jurisdiction to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, if a complaint for that purpose is filed within 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened.</textblock>
    <textblock>There are approximately 750 watermelon handlers and</textblock>
    <textblock>5,000 watermelon producers in the contiguous 48 States of the United States who are subject to the Plan. Small agricultural service firms are defined by the Small Business Administration [13 CFR 121.601] as those having annual receipts of less than $3,500,000 and small agricultural producers are defined as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000. The majority of watermelon handlers and producers may be classified as small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Administrator of AMS has determined that this action would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</textblock>
