    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to</textblock>
    <textblock>adopt regulations to ensure the safe processing and importing of</textblock>
    <textblock>fish and fishery products (hereinafter referred to as seafood).</textblock>
    <textblock>These procedures include the monitoring of selected processes in</textblock>
    <textblock>accordance with Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP)</textblock>
    <textblock>principles. HACCP is a preventive system of hazard control that</textblock>
    <textblock>can be used by food processors and importers. FDA is proposing</textblock>
    <textblock>these regulations because a system of preventive controls is the</textblock>
    <textblock>most effective and efficient way to ensure that these products</textblock>
    <textblock>are safe.</textblock>
