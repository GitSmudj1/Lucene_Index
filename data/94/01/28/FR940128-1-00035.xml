    <textblock>D. Corrective Actions</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing in §123.7 to require that deviations from</textblock>
    <textblock>critical limits trigger a prescribed series of actions by a</textblock>
    <textblock>processor or importer, including determining the significance of</textblock>
    <textblock>the deviation, taking appropriate remedial action, and</textblock>
    <textblock>documenting the actions taken. This proposed provision is</textblock>
    <textblock>consistent with the HACCP principles enunciated by NACMCF (Ref.</textblock>
    <textblock>34). First, under proposed §123.7(a)(1), any critical limit</textblock>
    <textblock>deviation will require the segregation and holding of the</textblock>
    <textblock>affected product until the significance of the deviation can be</textblock>
    <textblock>determined. This step is necessary to ensure that products that</textblock>
    <textblock>may be injurious to health do not enter commerce until the impact</textblock>
    <textblock>of the deviation on safety has been determined, and the safety of</textblock>
    <textblock>the product assured. Second, under proposed §123.7(a)(2), the</textblock>
    <textblock>processor or importer must actually determine the effect of the</textblock>
    <textblock>deviation on safety, and third, under proposed §123.7(a)(3), it</textblock>
    <textblock>must take whatever corrective actions are necessary with respect</textblock>
    <textblock>to both the affected product and the critical control point at</textblock>
    <textblock>which the deviation occurred, based on that determination.</textblock>
    <textblock>Some deviations, especially if they are caught quickly, will</textblock>
    <textblock>not adversely affect safety. For example, if a refrigeration</textblock>
    <textblock>unit fails, but product being stored there is moved to a</textblock>
    <textblock>functioning unit before any appreciable warming of the product</textblock>
    <textblock>can occur, safety will not have been affected.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing to require in §123.7(a)(2) that the safety</textblock>
    <textblock>determination be made by an individual who has successfully</textblock>
    <textblock>completed training in HACCP principles (see proposed §123.9).</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA has tentatively concluded that this requirement is necessary</textblock>
    <textblock>to ensure that the person who is reviewing the significance of</textblock>
    <textblock>the deviation understands the possible consequences of a</textblock>
    <textblock>processing deviation and knows how to take appropriate measures</textblock>
    <textblock>in response to a deviation. FDA does not expect that a processor</textblock>
    <textblock>or importer will be able, without assistance, to determine the</textblock>
    <textblock>public health consequences of every possible deviation. The</textblock>
    <textblock>required training will, however, provide the processor or</textblock>
    <textblock>importer with information about when and how to obtain the</textblock>
    <textblock>assistance of an analytical laboratory, outside expert, State</textblock>
    <textblock>regulatory authority, or FDA district office in determining the</textblock>
    <textblock>proper course of action.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing to require in §123.7(a)(4) and (a)(5) that</textblock>
    <textblock>the processor or importer review the process and the HACCP plan</textblock>
    <textblock>to determine whether the deviation reveals the need to modify the</textblock>
    <textblock>process or the plan, or both, and to make such modifications as</textblock>
    <textblock>may be needed. It is critically important that a processor or</textblock>
    <textblock>importer learn as much as possible from the occurrence of a</textblock>
    <textblock>deviation and take steps to ensure that it will not be repeated.</textblock>
    <textblock>The plan should be a living document that the processor or</textblock>
    <textblock>importer should modify and update as circumstances warrant.</textblock>
    <textblock>These proposed requirements will ensure that the processor and</textblock>
    <textblock>importer connect day-to-day processing and other operations to</textblock>
    <textblock>the plan. Each modification is required to be noted, dated, and</textblock>
    <textblock>maintained as part of their HACCP records.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing to require in §123.7(b) that when a</textblock>
    <textblock>processor or importer receives a consumer complaint that may be</textblock>
    <textblock>related to the performance of a critical control point or that</textblock>
    <textblock>may reflect a critical limit deviation, it take appropriate steps</textblock>
    <textblock>to determine whether a deviation or other system failure has</textblock>
    <textblock>occurred that warrants remedial action and take such remedial</textblock>
    <textblock>action that appears to be warranted under §123.7(a). The</textblock>
    <textblock>importance of consumer complaints has been discussed above.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA recognizes that segregation and holding of the affected</textblock>
    <textblock>product will not always be feasible or warranted in response to a</textblock>
    <textblock>consumer complaint. In many cases, there will be no product to</textblock>
    <textblock>hold because all of the product in question will already be in</textblock>
    <textblock>commerce. In other cases, a processor or importer may be able to</textblock>
    <textblock>determine very quickly whether a deviation has actually occurred.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing in §123.7(c) to require that processors</textblock>
    <textblock>and importers clearly document all of the steps that they take in</textblock>
    <textblock>response to a critical limit deviation or a consumer complaint</textblock>
    <textblock>and include that documentation as part of their HACCP</textblock>
    <textblock>records. FDA has tentatively concluded that the processor, the</textblock>
    <textblock>importer, and FDA will benefit from this requirement.</textblock>
    <textblock>Documentation helps processors and importers to think the whole</textblock>
    <textblock>process through in a thorough and methodical way and to establish</textblock>
    <textblock>to their own satisfaction that they have taken proper steps.</textblock>
    <textblock>Documentation enables the regulatory agency to determine whether</textblock>
    <textblock>the processor or importer is able to regain control once a</textblock>
    <textblock>deviation occurs and to ensure that potentially unsafe products</textblock>
    <textblock>are being prevented from entering commerce or at least quickly</textblock>
    <textblock>removed from commerce.</textblock>
    <textblock>The documentation that FDA is proposing to require of the</textblock>
    <textblock>processor's or importer's response to the consumer complaints</textblock>
    <textblock>covered by §123.7(b) will enable the processor, the importer,</textblock>
    <textblock>and FDA reviewers to determine whether those consumer complaints</textblock>
    <textblock>are receiving appropriate attention in a timely manner. The</textblock>
    <textblock>documentation should be clear enough to allow a determination of</textblock>
    <textblock>the nature of the complaint and of the time it took from the</textblock>
    <textblock>receipt of the complaint for processor or importer to review it</textblock>
    <textblock>and to take any necessary corrective actions. FDA may choose on</textblock>
    <textblock>occasion to review a limited number of consumer complaints to</textblock>
    <textblock>match against the documentation maintained by the processor or</textblock>
    <textblock>the importer.</textblock>
