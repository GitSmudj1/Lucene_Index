    <textblock>Take notice that on January 13, 1994, Great Lakes Gas Transmission Limited Partnership (Great Lakes) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the following revised tariff sheet, proposed to become effective as of January 1, 1994:</textblock>
    <textblock>Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 7</textblock>
    <textblock>Great Lakes states that the proposed tariff sheet was filed to reflect Great Lakes' compliance with the Commission's decision in Docket No. TM94-2-51-000 issued on December 30, 1993 (Order).</textblock>
    <textblock>Great Lakes states that the Commission's Order clarified that historical throughput is to be used for determining the GRI surcharge for both historical and new shippers and that the revised tariff sheet was filed to comply with that clarification. In addition, Great Lakes states that in compliance with the Commission's Order, the revised tariff sheet included a note indicating that the minimum GRI charge shall be $0.000 per Mcf.</textblock>
    <textblock>Great Lakes requested that the above tariff sheet become effective as of January 1, 1994, to coincide with the effective date of the GRI funding unit rates approved in the above-described commission Order.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before January 31, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the Commission's public reference room.</textblock>
