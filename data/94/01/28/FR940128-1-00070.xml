    <textblock>A recent survey of smoked fish and smoked fish products in</textblock>
    <textblock>Iceland has shown that 29 percent of samples tested were</textblock>
    <textblock>contaminated with</textblock>
    <textblock>Listeria</textblock>
    <textblock>species, including</textblock>
    <textblock>L. monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 141). Another survey revealed that 8.9 percent and 13.6</textblock>
    <textblock>percent of hot- and cold-smoked fish, respectively, were</textblock>
    <textblock>contaminated with</textblock>
    <textblock>L. monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 142). Cold-smoked fish</textblock>
    <textblock>may pose a significant health risk, particularly when stored for</textblock>
    <textblock>extended periods. When raw salmon was inoculated with known</textblock>
    <textblock>populations of</textblock>
    <textblock>L. monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>and smoked at 78.8 to 86</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (26</textblock>
    <textblock>to 30</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) for 6 hours, and the finished product stored at 39.2</textblock>
    <textblock>and 50</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (4 and 10</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) for up to 30 days, investigators observed</textblock>
    <textblock>substantial increases in</textblock>
    <textblock>L. monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>populations at both</textblock>
    <textblock>incubation temperatures (Ref. 143). No known cases of listeriosis have been linked to smoked seafood consumption in the</textblock>
    <textblock>United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>In contrast, studies have shown that properly controlled</textblock>
    <textblock>hot-smoking processes effectively eliminate</textblock>
    <textblock>L. monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>contamination (Ref. 144). In raw trout inoculated with high doses of</textblock>
    <textblock>L. monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>, stored for 12 hours in a marinade</textblock>
    <textblock>containing 10 percent NaCl, and then subjected to a hot-smoke</textblock>
    <textblock>process (dried for 30 minutes at 140</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (60</textblock>
    <textblock>○C), cooked at 230</textblock>
    <textblock>○F</textblock>
    <textblock>(110</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) until an internal temperature of 149</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (65</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) was</textblock>
    <textblock>maintained for 20 minutes, and finally smoked for 45 minutes at</textblock>
    <textblock>140</textblock>
    <textblock>○F),</textblock>
    <textblock>L. monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>did not survive the smoking process.</textblock>
    <textblock>However, when fish were inoculated after smoking and stored at</textblock>
    <textblock>46.4 to 50</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (8 to 10</textblock>
    <textblock>○C), a significant increase in</textblock>
    <textblock>L.</textblock>
    <textblock>monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>populations was observed after up to 20 days of</textblock>
    <textblock>storage. These findings further emphasize the importance of</textblock>
    <textblock>preventing the contamination of processed fish.</textblock>
    <textblock>Studies have also shown the importance of controlling the</textblock>
    <textblock>salt concentration in smoked fish. Although</textblock>
    <textblock>L. monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>can</textblock>
    <textblock>survive in environments containing up to 20 percent NaCl (Ref.</textblock>
    <textblock>145), it has been demonstrated that the organism becomes</textblock>
    <textblock>increasingly more sensitive to NaCl when it is exposed to heat</textblock>
    <textblock>processing (Ref. 146).</textblock>
    <textblock>Because of the prevalence of</textblock>
    <textblock>L. monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>in the</textblock>
    <textblock>environment, it may be impossible to completely eliminate the</textblock>
    <textblock>organism from all foods. However, use of the sanitary practices</textblock>
    <textblock>and processing practices proposed in this document should prevent</textblock>
    <textblock>cross-contamination and growth of the organism in smoked and</textblock>
    <textblock>smoke-flavored seafoods.</textblock>
    <textblock>Smoking fish is a delicate process, involving a number of</textblock>
    <textblock>interrelated variables including times, temperatures, and</textblock>
    <textblock>exposure to smoke, salt, and sodium nitrite, when used. However,</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA believes that, by its very nature, this process involves</textblock>
    <textblock>certain inherent risks, risks that, if not attended to, can have</textblock>
    <textblock>very significant consequences.</textblock>
    <textblock>For example, the times/temperatures involved in the ``hot</textblock>
    <textblock>process'' can injure but not kill</textblock>
    <textblock>C. botulinum</textblock>
    <textblock>spores while</textblock>
    <textblock>killing spoilage microorganisms. Thus, during the period when</textblock>
    <textblock>the spoilage microorganisms are becoming reestablished, surviving</textblock>
    <textblock>C. botulinum</textblock>
    <textblock>spores would be presented with an optimum growth</textblock>
    <textblock>environment because of the lack of competition. Yet, because of</textblock>
    <textblock>the absence of spoilage microorganisms, spoilage odors that would</textblock>
    <textblock>warn consumers away from potentially dangerous products would not</textblock>
    <textblock>be present. Botulism toxin alone is not detectable by sensory</textblock>
    <textblock>examination.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, because of the number and types of steps</textblock>
    <textblock>involved, the processing of smoked fish involves an unusual</textblock>
    <textblock>amount of handling of the product relative to other seafood</textblock>
    <textblock>processing procedures. Increased handling presents increased</textblock>
    <textblock>opportunities for contamination during the process than would</textblock>
    <textblock>otherwise be the case.</textblock>
