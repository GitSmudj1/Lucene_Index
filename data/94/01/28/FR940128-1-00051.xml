    <textblock>If assurances do not exist, as described in §123.12(a),</textblock>
    <textblock>that the product has been produced under an HACCP plan and under</textblock>
    <textblock>sanitation controls that are equivalent to those required of</textblock>
    <textblock>domestic processors, the agency will deny entry to the products</textblock>
    <textblock>as provided in proposed §123.12(b) because the product will</textblock>
    <textblock>appear to be adulterated (see section 801(a) of the act).</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Raw Molluscan Shellfish</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing to require in part 123, subpart C that</textblock>
    <textblock>processors of raw molluscan shellfish include in their HACCP</textblock>
    <textblock>plans how they control the origin of the molluscan shellfish that</textblock>
    <textblock>they process. Proposed §123.28 requires that these controls</textblock>
    <textblock>include obtaining raw shellfish only from approved growing waters</textblock>
    <textblock>through harvesters or processors licensed by a shellfish control</textblock>
    <textblock>authority. FDA is proposing to require that processors maintain</textblock>
    <textblock>records to document that each lot of raw molluscan shellfish</textblock>
    <textblock>meets these requirements. Under this proposal, these records</textblock>
    <textblock>will constitute HACCP records subject to the requirements of</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed §123.8.</textblock>
    <textblock>The agency is also proposing to establish a system of</textblock>
    <textblock>tagging or other labeling that provides information about the</textblock>
    <textblock>origin of all shellstock and shucked molluscan shellfish received</textblock>
    <textblock>by a processor. FDA is proposing to amend §1240.60 (21 CFR</textblock>
    <textblock>1240.60) to provide for such a tagging system.</textblock>
    <textblock>Raw molluscan shellfish are molluscan shellfish that have</textblock>
    <textblock>not been subject to a treatment sufficient to kill pathogens of</textblock>
    <textblock>public health significance. Shellfish that have been subjected</textblock>
    <textblock>to any form of treatment, such as steam, hot water, or dry heat,</textblock>
    <textblock>for a short period of time before shucking to facilitate removal</textblock>
    <textblock>of the meat from the shell are still considered to be raw.</textblock>
    <textblock>Molluscan shellfish consumed raw or partially cooked pose</textblock>
    <textblock>unique public health risks. They probably cause the majority of</textblock>
    <textblock>all seafood-related illnesses in the United States (Refs. 6; and</textblock>
    <textblock>7, p. 330). The safety of raw molluscan shellfish directly</textblock>
    <textblock>reflects the cleanliness of its aquatic environment. Of all</textblock>
    <textblock>edible species of fish, molluscan shellfish are unique in that</textblock>
    <textblock>they are nonmotile, filter feeding organisms. They pump large</textblock>
    <textblock>quantities of water through their bodies during the normal</textblock>
    <textblock>feeding process (Refs. 7, p. 331; and 90, p. c-4). The positive</textblock>
    <textblock>relationship between harvesting areas contaminated by sewage</textblock>
    <textblock>pollution and shellfish-borne enteric disease has been</textblock>
    <textblock>demonstrated many times (Refs. 7, p. 76; 91 and 92). During</textblock>
    <textblock>feeding, the shellfish may concentrate pathogenic microorganisms,</textblock>
    <textblock>deadly toxins associated with naturally occurring marine plankton</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 93), or forms of agricultural and industrial pollution</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 94). Among the pathogenic microorganisms is the Norwalk</textblock>
    <textblock>virus, probably the most common cause of seafood-borne illness.</textblock>
    <textblock>This virus commonly occurs in waters contaminated by sewage</textblock>
    <textblock>effluent (Refs. 7, p. 76; 91, 92, and 95).</textblock>
    <textblock>Before the adoption of the current public health controls in</textblock>
    <textblock>the United States, shellfish commonly transmitted many serious</textblock>
    <textblock>communicable diseases. Consumption of raw or undercooked seafood</textblock>
    <textblock>from polluted waters can be a mode of transmission for typhoid</textblock>
    <textblock>fever, infectious hepatitis, and cholera (Ref. 67). These</textblock>
    <textblock>diseases are still commonly associated with raw shellfish</textblock>
    <textblock>consumption in lesser developed countries (Ref. 7, p. 73).</textblock>
    <textblock>However, the incidence of these diseases in the United States has</textblock>
    <textblock>been largely controlled under section 361 of the PHS Act (42</textblock>
    <textblock>U.S.C. 264). This statute was enacted to prevent the</textblock>
    <textblock>introduction, transmission, and spread of communicable disease.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under provisions of the PHS Act, FDA is empowered to accept</textblock>
    <textblock>assistance from the States to protect public health.</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, FDA participates in a Federal/State cooperative</textblock>
    <textblock>program called NSSP.</textblock>
    <textblock>Established in 1925, the NSSP provides water quality</textblock>
    <textblock>criteria for assessing the safety of shellfish growing areas.</textblock>
    <textblock>These criteria are applied by the States under the authority of</textblock>
    <textblock>their own laws. The NSSP ``Manual of Operations'' provides the</textblock>
    <textblock>basis (Refs. 90 and 96) for State regulation in 23 shellfish-producing States and 6 nations. Each participating State or</textblock>
    <textblock>nation classifies and monitors its shellfish growing waters,</textblock>
    <textblock>controls harvesting, inspects shellfish packing and shucking</textblock>
    <textblock>facilities, and issues certificates to individual shellfish</textblock>
    <textblock>processors that meet the State or foreign government's shellfish</textblock>
    <textblock>control criteria.</textblock>
