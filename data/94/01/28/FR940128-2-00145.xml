    <textblock>_Link comprehensive systems of care with HIV/AIDS</textblock>
    <textblock>clinical research trials resulting in increased access for</textblock>
    <textblock>currently under represented populations of children, youth, women,</textblock>
    <textblock>and their families.</textblock>
    <textblock>Funding Categories</textblock>
    <textblock>Two categories of projects will be funded in FY 1994. Applications</textblock>
    <textblock>which do not fall within these program categories will not be</textblock>
    <textblock>considered.</textblock>
    <textblock>The first category of grants, the HIV Demonstration Projects for</textblock>
    <textblock>Children, Adolescents, and Families, continues development of</textblock>
    <textblock>comprehensive care demonstrations, including efforts to develop</textblock>
    <textblock>innovative models that foster collaboration between clinical</textblock>
    <textblock>research institutions and family-centered primary/community-based</textblock>
    <textblock>medical and social service programs for children, youth, women and</textblock>
    <textblock>their families. Projects will focus on local capacity-building,</textblock>
    <textblock>making maximum use of all available public and private resources</textblock>
    <textblock>for reaching and providing health care and supportive services to</textblock>
    <textblock>the target population. Projects should strengthen the</textblock>
    <textblock>infrastructure for the comprehensive system of care by broadening</textblock>
    <textblock>the coalition of agencies, providers, community organizations and</textblock>
    <textblock>families participating in services planning, coordination, and</textblock>
    <textblock>financing. These include other appropriate Federal, State, and</textblock>
    <textblock>local programs serving children with special health care needs</textblock>
    <textblock>under Title V Maternal and Child Health programs, hemophilia</textblock>
    <textblock>treatment centers, Ryan White Title I, II and III programs,</textblock>
    <textblock>providers funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services</textblock>
    <textblock>Administration (SAMSHA) and Centers for Disease Control and</textblock>
    <textblock>Prevention (CDC), and other programs serving the target population</textblock>
    <textblock>(e.g., Medicaid, developmental disabilities, special education) and</textblock>
    <textblock>providers, payers, organizations, and support groups in the private</textblock>
    <textblock>sector with a similar focus.</textblock>
    <textblock>Preference for funding in this category will be given to the</textblock>
    <textblock>competing renewal of currently funded Pediatric/Family AIDS</textblock>
    <textblock>Demonstration projects serving children, youth, women, and families</textblock>
    <textblock>infected with or affected by the HIV infection which demonstrate an</textblock>
    <textblock>established model of a comprehensive and coordinated system of care</textblock>
    <textblock>that is culturally-competent, family-centered, and community-based.</textblock>
    <textblock>This means that these projects will be funded ahead of new groups</textblock>
    <textblock>of applications in this category.</textblock>
    <textblock>The second category of funding will be used to initiate the</textblock>
    <textblock>development of comprehensive care systems for HIV affected</textblock>
    <textblock>children, adolescents and families in cities or states where there</textblock>
    <textblock>is no currently funded pediatric health care demonstration project</textblock>
    <textblock>nor well organized care system for the target population and where</textblock>
    <textblock>there are barriers to access to care and clinical research trials.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicants for funding in this category will be supported for</textblock>
    <textblock>initial planning activities to develop their infrastructure for</textblock>
    <textblock>comprehensive care with the ultimate goal of a mature demonstration of family-centered, community-based coordinated care described in</textblock>
    <textblock>Category (1).</textblock>
    <textblock>Availability of Funds</textblock>
    <textblock>Approximately $22.0 million is available for the HIV Demonstration</textblock>
    <textblock>Program for Children, Adolescents, and Families, of which</textblock>
    <textblock>approximately $10.3 million will be available for competing</textblock>
    <textblock>renewals and new competitive grants. The following is an</textblock>
    <textblock>approximation of funds available and the number of grants</textblock>
    <textblock>anticipated to be awarded in each category:</textblock>
    <textblock>_Category (1)_$10.0 million, up to 20 grants.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Category (2)_$.3 million, up to 4 grants. Individual</textblock>
    <textblock>grants are not expected to exceed $75,000 per year.</textblock>
    <textblock>For Category (1), project periods are three years. For Category</textblock>
    <textblock>(2), project periods are from one to two years, depending upon the</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed scope of work.</textblock>
    <textblock>Special Concerns</textblock>
    <textblock>HIV Demonstration Program for Children, Adolescents, and Families</textblock>
    <textblock>grantees supported by HRSA should coordinate their projects with</textblock>
    <textblock>other Federal, State, and local programs concerned with AIDS and/or</textblock>
    <textblock>serving the target population of children, youth, women and</textblock>
    <textblock>families affected by or at risk for HIV/AIDS, particularly Title V</textblock>
    <textblock>Maternal and Child Health programs and other Ryan White programs.</textblock>
