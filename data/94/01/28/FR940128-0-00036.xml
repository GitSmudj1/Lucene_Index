    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>On March 24, 1993, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) proposed to approve a January 4, 1989 revision to the Illinois sulfur dioxide (SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>

    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>emission limits for the Shell Oil Complex in Roxana, Wood River Township, Illinois. This action also clarifies USEPA's approval of related Illinois SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>rules which were included in Illinois' January 4, 1989 submittal but were subsequently revised and resubmitted. The USEPA's approval of these rules satisfies the September 28, 1984 notice of SIP deficiency for Wood River Township.</textblock>
    <textblock>The USEPA's action is based upon a revision request which was submitted by the State to satisfy the requirements of the Clean Air Act.</textblock>

    <textblock>I. Summary of State Submittal</textblock>
    <textblock>On September 28, 1984, USEPA informed the Governor of Illinois that the Illinois SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>SIP was inadequate to protect the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in Alton and Wood River Townships of Madison County, Illinois, and requested that the State submit revisions to the SIP to address the inadequacy. The determination that the SIP needed to be revised was based on modeling performed by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA) for a regional study which included Madison County. Modeled violations of the NAAQS in Wood River Township were attributed primarily to the Shell Oil refinery complex in Roxana, Illinois. IEPA was able to demonstrate NAAQS attainment in the Wood River area through significant emission reductions at the Shell Oil complex. The Shell Oil emission limits are set forth at 35 Illinois Administrative Code (35 IAC) 214.382, and were submitted to USEPA as a revision to the Illinois SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>SIP on January 4, 1989.</textblock>
    <textblock>On March 24, 1993 (58 FR 15824), USEPA stated that the January 4, 1989 submittal could be approved if Illinois placed a set of recordkeeping and reporting requirements for enforcement purposes into a federally enforceable State operating permit for the Shell Oil Company. Operating permits issued under Illinois' federally enforceable operating permit program, which was approved and incorporated into the Illinois SIP by USEPA on December 17, 1992 (57 FR 59928) at 40 CFR 52.737, are federally enforceable parts of the SIP upon issuance by the State, unless USEPA deems them not federally enforceable. The USEPA transmitted a list of the necessary permit conditions for Shell Oil in a June 12, 1992 letter to the State. On November 10, 1992, the Shell Oil Company applied for an operating permit which would include the recordkeeping and reporting requirements identified by USEPA. On September 1, 1993, a public hearing was held in Wood River, Illinois, to receive comments on the Shell Oil permit. Shell Oil's operating permit (I.D. Number 199090AAA) was issued on November 2, 1993, in accordance with the requirements of Illinois' federally approved SIP. On December 27, 1993, USEPA determined that permit number 199090AAA meets the requirements for Federal enforceability. Permit number 199090AAA adequately addresses the enforceability deficiencies in 35 IAC 214.382 by incorporating the recordkeeping and reporting requirements included in the June 12, 1992 letter. Because it is federally enforceable, this operating permit supplements Illinois' January 4, 1989 SIP submittal and renders the January 4, 1989 submittal fully approvable.</textblock>
