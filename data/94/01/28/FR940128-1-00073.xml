    <textblock>The need for some type of agency guidance on smoked fish is</textblock>
    <textblock>also evidenced by several other factors. First, the 1970 final</textblock>
    <textblock>rule, which covered only hot-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish and the processing parameters that they required, is still</textblock>
    <textblock>being used as a guideline by some States. These earlier</textblock>
    <textblock>parameters could result in commercially undesirable products.</textblock>
    <textblock>These parameters ought to be updated with the current</textblock>
    <textblock>technological understanding and processing flexibility for both</textblock>
    <textblock>hot and cold smoked products. The guidance in this document can</textblock>
    <textblock>provide the basis on which such updating can occur.</textblock>
    <textblock>Second, the manufacture or sale of cold-processed fish</textblock>
    <textblock>products is not permitted in at least two States because there</textblock>
    <textblock>are no regulations or regulatory guidelines for these products</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 170). There is some pressure, however, to permit the sale</textblock>
    <textblock>of these products. The Canadian Government, for example, has</textblock>
    <textblock>urged these States, Minnesota and Michigan, to permit the sale of</textblock>
    <textblock>these products so that Canadian products may be exported to the</textblock>
    <textblock>United States (Ref. 170). Some type of guidance that helps to</textblock>
    <textblock>define the processing parameters and techniques that reduce human</textblock>
    <textblock>health risks from cold-process smoked and smoke-flavored fish</textblock>
    <textblock>products would provide State, as well as federal, public health</textblock>
    <textblock>officials with the tools necessary to evaluate the safety of cold</textblock>
    <textblock>processed products manufactured in the United States, as well as</textblock>
    <textblock>those imported into the United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>Third, in 1988 FDA conducted a survey of processing</textblock>
    <textblock>parameters used by fish smoking plants in the United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>Seventy five percent of the firms surveyed did not do final</textblock>
    <textblock>product testing to ascertain whether their products met commonly recognized (Ref. 182) parameters for their products (Ref. 24).</textblock>
    <textblock>The information collected in this survey augmented information</textblock>
    <textblock>obtained from the New York State Department of Agriculture and</textblock>
    <textblock>Marketing (Ref. 24), which had conducted a similar survey of fish</textblock>
    <textblock>smoking establishments in that State at approximately the same</textblock>
    <textblock>time. A total of 64 establishments were surveyed by FDA and New</textblock>
    <textblock>York State, representing over 90 percent of the smoked fish</textblock>
    <textblock>manufacturers in the United States. Among the species of fish</textblock>
    <textblock>included in the survey were chubs, bluefish, trout, carp, salmon,</textblock>
    <textblock>whitefish, and herring. Processing information was collected</textblock>
    <textblock>from manufacturers, and samples were collected for laboratory</textblock>
    <textblock>analysis.</textblock>
