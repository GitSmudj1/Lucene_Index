    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports promotes and encourages the development of physical fitness and sports programs for all Americans. In 1990, as part of its agenda, the PCPFS initiated the first Great American Workout as a major event to focus on exercise. A second and third workout were held in 1991 and 1992 respectively. The south lawn of the White House served as the backdrop for this fitness event for the Nation. The Great American Workout for this year is scheduled to take place on May 2, 1994, pending approval from the White House.</textblock>
    <textblock>Requirements of Participation</textblock>
    <textblock>The PCPFS is seeking to hold this year's Great American Workout with an events planning organization which has demonstrated the ability and experience to coordinate this type of national event. Under the guidance of the PCPFS, the organization selected as events planner will be responsible for the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Develop a publicity campaign for the event, including the printing of official brochures, invitations and tickets, submitted for PCPFS' concurrence.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Manage hotel and transportation arrangements for special invitees.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Assist in the planning and logistical efforts needed for the workout stations for the activity demonstrations.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Plan and organize the overall activities as directed by the PCPFS.</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Plan and organize any reception and breakfast arrangements agreed upon by the PCPFS.</textblock>
    <textblock>(6) Provide insurance and first aid stations.</textblock>
    <textblock>(7) Assist with obtaining corporate sponsors of the event.</textblock>
    <textblock>(8) Under the direction of the White House, the Department of Health and Human Services and the PCPFS, work with various vendors to ensure provision of high quality services for the event, within the agreed-upon time frames.</textblock>
    <textblock>Availability of Funds</textblock>
    <textblock>There are no Federal Funds available for the Great American Workout. It will be the function of the events planning organization to assist with the raising of necessary funds for the event.</textblock>
    <textblock>Eligibility for Participation</textblock>
    <textblock>To be eligible, an entity should be: (1) A private, events planning organization; and (2) and organization that by virtue of its nature and purpose has a legitimate interest in physical fitness and sports.</textblock>
    <textblock>Content of Request for Participation</textblock>
    <textblock>Each request for participation as the events planning organization should contain: (1) a description of the organization and its capabilities; (2) a summary of the manner in which it would carry out its duties; and (3) its plan for assisting with the arranging for the funding of the event.</textblock>
    <textblock>Evaluation Criteria</textblock>
    <textblock>The events planning organization will be selected by the PCPFS, following a review of the proposals, based on the following review criteria:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Organization's qualifications and capabilities to perform duties that are required for events of this nature; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Adequacy of current staff to perform all required duties.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) The ability of the organization to arrange for the funding of the event.</textblock>
    <textblock>Other Information</textblock>
    <textblock>Prior to the selection of the events planning organization, the PCPFS staff will meet separately with those organizations whose written submissions best meet the evaluation criteria. Since it is anticipated that the Great American Workout will involve events held on the grounds of the White House, certain restrictions apply to the commercial use of an events planning organization's source or sources of funding. The successful organization will be required to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the Department of Health and Human Services setting forth the details of the event. In addition, agreements with other interested parties may be required. Participation by any organization or source of funding may in no way be construed as an endorsement of any commercial product by the PCPFS.</textblock>
