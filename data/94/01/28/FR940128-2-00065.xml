    <textblock>Each scoping session will begin with a welcome and introduction of DOE officials, followed by short presentations by DOE officials on the EIS process, the Hanford TWRS program and the proposed interim actions. Individuals and organization spokespersons will then have an opportunity to present oral comments to DOE representatives. The agenda will be repeated twice a day at each location, in afternoon and evening sessions. The hours for the sessions are: 1 pm to 4:30 pm and 6:30 pm to 10 pm.</textblock>
    <textblock>Requests to speak at these meetings may be made by calling the toll-free telephone number, 1-800-500-1660, by 3 p.m. the day before the meeting or by writing to Donald Alexander (see</textblock>
    <textblock>ADDRESSES</textblock>
    <textblock>, below).</textblock>
    <textblock>The meetings will be chaired by a presiding officer but will not be conducted as evidentiary hearings; speakers will not be cross-examined although the presiding officer and DOE representatives present may ask clarifying questions. Individuals requesting to speak on behalf of an organization must identify the organization. A 5-minute limit will be imposed on each individual speaker except that a speaker representing an organization (one per organization) will be given a 10-minute limit. These limits are to ensure that all who wish to speak have an opportunity to do so. Comments will be recorded by a court reporter and will become part of the scoping meeting record.</textblock>
    <textblock>Persons who have not submitted a request to speak in advance of the scoping meetings may register at the meetings and will be called on to speak on a first-come first-served basis as time permits. Written comments will also be accepted at the meetings, and speakers are encouraged to provide written versions of their oral comments for the record.</textblock>
    <textblock>DOE will review scoping comments to determine their applicability to the two proposed EISs. Records of, and responses to, the scoping comments will be provided as appropriate in either the Implementation Plan (IP) for the TWRS EIS or the IP for the new tanks EIS. The IPs will provide guidance for preparation of the TWRS and new tanks EISs and establish their scopes and content (10 CFR 1021.312). The IPs will be issued prior to the release of the draft EISs and copies will be available for inspection in public reading room locations to be announced.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The Federal government created the Hanford Site, near Richland, Washington, in 1943, as part of the Manhattan Project, to produce plutonium for national defense. Metallic uranium fuel was irradiated in nuclear reactors and then the fuel was chemically processed to recover plutonium. Plutonium production at the Hanford Site stopped in 1988.</textblock>
