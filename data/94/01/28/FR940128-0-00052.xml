    <textblock>1. The BSAI Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) is allocated annually among gear types as follows: 2 percent to vessels using jig gear; 44 percent to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear; and 54 percent to vessels using trawl gear. In monitoring the use of these gear allocations, all cod catch and cod bycatch by each of the three gear groups will be counted against its allocation;</textblock>
    <textblock>2. The Secretary, after consultation with the Council, is authorized to seasonally apportion the amount of the Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear. Seasonal apportionments will be divided among three seasons of 4 months duration each, and will be established through the annual September-December specifications process (§675.20(a)). Any seasonal apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear must be based on the following information: (A) Seasonal distribution of prohibited species; (B) seasonal distribution of Pacific cod relative to prohibited species distribution; (C) expected variations in Pacific halibut bycatch rates throughout the fishing year; and (D) economic effects of any seasonal apportionment of Pacific cod on the hook-and-line and pot gear fisheries.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The Director, Alaska Region, NMFS (Regional Director) is authorized to reallocate Pacific cod from vessels using trawl gear to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear, and vice versa, anytime during the year the Regional Director determines that one gear group or the other will not be able to harvest its allocation of Pacific cod. That portion of the jig gear allocation that is expected to go unharvested may be transferred to vessels using trawl and hook-and-line or pot gear at the beginning of the third 4-month season.</textblock>
    <textblock>The intent of the measures implemented under Amendment 24 is to provide stability in the trawl gear and fixed gear (jig, hook-and-line and pot) fisheries by establishing designated allocations of the Pacific cod TAC among vessels using these different gear types. Further explanation of, and reasons for, these measures are contained in the preamble to the proposed rule (58 FR 57803, October 27, 1993).</textblock>
    <textblock>1994 Specifications of the Pacific cod TAC</textblock>
    <textblock>The Council recommended proposed 1994 gear allocations and seasonal apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear at its September 1993 meeting. The proposed specifications for the 1994 Pacific cod fishery were published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>for public review and comment as part of the proposed rule implementing Amendment 24 (58 FR 57803, October 27, 1993). At its December 1993 meeting, the Council reaffirmed its September recommendations. NMFS concurs with the Council's recommendations and has included the final specifications for the 1994 Pacific cod fisheries in this action implementing Amendment 24 (Tables 1 and 2).</textblock>
    <textblock>Consistent with regulations authorizing seasonal apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear (§675.20(a)(2)(v)), a discussion of the seasonal apportionments relative to the seasonal distribution of Pacific cod and prohibited species, prohibited species bycatch rates, and economic effects on the hook-and-line and pot gear fisheries is presented in the preamble to the proposed rule implementing Amendment 24 (58 FR 57803, October 27, 1993). In 1994, 1995, and 1996, the proposed and final specifications for Pacific cod will be established through the annual TAC specification process undertaken by NMFS and the Council during the September and December Council meetings each year (§§675.20(a)(2) and 675.21(b)(3)).</textblock>
