    <textblock>Take notice that as required by the Commission's Order December 30, 1993 Order in Docket Nos. RP94-66-000,</textblock>
    <textblock>et al.</textblock>
    <textblock>(December 30 Order), Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern) on January 14, 1994, submitted for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1, the tariff sheets listed on Appendix A of the filing.</textblock>
    <textblock>Texas Eastern states that the December 30 Order accepted tariff sheets filed on December 1, 1993 (December 1 Filing) by Texas Eastern to recover gas supply realignment costs (GSR Costs). The December 1 Filing was Texas Eastern's third quarterly filing to recover such costs and was filed pursuant to section 15.2(C) of the General Terms and Conditions of Texas Eastern's FERC Gas Tariff, Sixth Revised Volume No. 1. Ordering Paragraph (A) of the December 30 Order required certain tariff sheets be ``refiled within fifteen days of this order to conform to the conditions set forth in the body of this order, and the ordering paragraphs below.'' Texas Eastern states that the tariff sheets listed in Appendix A are submitted to satisfy the requirements of the December 30 Order.</textblock>
    <textblock>Texas Eastern states that section 15.2(C) of the General Terms and Conditions has been revised in compliance with the December 30 Order as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Section 15.2(C)(2)(a) has been revised to extend the amortization and recovery period to two (2) years for buyout costs which are incurred after January 1, 1994 and which, in the aggregate, exceed fifteen (15) million dollars for a quarterly filing;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Section 15.2(C)(2)(a)(i) has been revised to reflect that applicable customers under Rate Schedules CDS, FT-1, LLFT and VKFT will be billed each month for a GSR Demand Surcharge Amount calculated by multiplying their current MDQ for a month times the GSR Demand Surcharge rate;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Section 15.2(C)(2)(a)(ii) has been revised to reflect that with the exception of the GSR Demand Surcharge component already designed to be paid over twenty-four (24) months, each customer shall have the option of paying its GSR Demand Surcharge obligation for any quarter in twenty-four (24) monthly installments.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Section 15.2(C)(2)(a)(iv) has been revised to clarify that the payment obligation for the GSR Demand Surcharge Amounts, together with applicable carrying charges, accrues in full as of the close of the month in which service was provided.</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Section 15.2(C)(5) has been added to reflect an annual true-up, as of any twelve (12) month period ending June 30, of the recovery of GSR costs allocated to be recovered from customers under Rate Schedules CDS, FT-1, LLFT and VKFT.</textblock>
    <textblock>Texas Eastern states that pursuant to section 15.2(C) of the General Terms and Conditions, ninety percent (90%) of GSR Costs are allocated to customers under Texas Eastern's Rate Schedules CDS, FT-1, LLFT, and VKFT in the form of a CSR Demand Surcharge calculated using customer MDQs. Texas Eastern's December 1 Filing allocated $12,701,656 of GSR Costs, inclusive of prior period adjustments and carrying charges, to its customers under Rate Schedules CDS, FT-1, LLFT and VKFT. However, Texas Eastern states that total customer MDQs under Rate Schedules CDS, FT-1, LLFT and VKFT have changed slightly since the December 1 Filing. Attachment A details the calculation of the new GSR Demand Surcharge unit rate based upon MDQs effective January 1, 1994. As a result, Texas Eastern submits Sub Sixth Revised Sheet No. 25, Sub Sixth Revised Sheet No. 30, Sub Third Revised Sheet No. 34A, Sub Third Revised Sheet No. 34B, Sub Third Revised Sheet No. 42A, and Sub Second Revised Sheet No. 42B to reflect this slight change in total firm customer MDQs. Texas Eastern states that the rates for Rate Schedules IT-1, PTI, LLIT and VKIT are not impacted by the slight change in total firm customer MDQs.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed effective date of the tariff sheets is January 1, 1994, consistent with the December 30 Order or the effective date of the tariff sheets they replace.</textblock>
    <textblock>Texas Eastern states that copies of the filing were served on firm customers of Texas Eastern and interested state commission. Copies were also served on all parties to Docket No. RP94-66-000.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capital Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before January 31, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.</textblock>
