    <textblock>DOC Position:</textblock>
    <textblock>We agree with petitioners. As stated in our preliminary determination, it is the Department's practice to calculate credit expenses using the period between shipment of the merchandise from the factory and payment. (See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Ferrosilicon From Venezuela, 58 FR 27522 (May 10, 1993) and Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Certain Hot-Rolled Lead and Bismuth Carbon Steel Products From the United Kingdom, 58 FR 6207 (January 27, 1993).) Moreover, we note that using the date of shipment from the factory does not overstate KT's U.S. credit expense because, contrary to KT's assertion, KT's factory shipment date generally follows the date of invoicing.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment 15:</textblock>
    <textblock>Petitioners argue that the Department should not make a difference in merchandise (difmer) adjustment in any instance where such an adjustment would lower KT's FMV. Petitioners base their argument on the fact that the difmer adjustments are based on KT's cost data which petitioners claim is unreliable.</textblock>
    <textblock>Respondent maintains that the Department should make difmer adjustments in cases where sales of non-identical merchandise are compared.</textblock>
    <textblock>DOC Position:</textblock>
    <textblock>We agree with respondent. Because the Department has relied on KT's COP data, we have used this data to make our difmer adjustments.</textblock>
    <textblock>Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation</textblock>
    <textblock>We are directing the Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidation of all entries of WSSP that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after September 7, 1993, the date of publication of our affirmative preliminary determination in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. The Customs Service shall require a cash deposit or the posting of a bond equal to the estimated amount by which the FMV of the merchandise subject to this investigation exceeds the USP as shown below. This suspension of liquidation will remain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average dumping margins are as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>ITC Notification</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with section 735(d) of the Act, we have notified the International Trade Commission (ITC) of our determination. As our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will determine whether these imports are materially injuring, or threaten material injury to, the U.S. industry within 45 days.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notification to Interested Parties</textblock>
    <textblock>This notice also serves as the only reminder to parties subject to administrative protective order (APO) of their responsibility concerning the return or destruction of proprietary information disclosed under APO in accordance with 19 CFR 353.34(d). Failure to comply is a violation of the APO.</textblock>
    <textblock>This determination is published pursuant to section 735(d) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.20(a)(4).</textblock>
    <textblock>Dated: January 21, 1994.</textblock>
