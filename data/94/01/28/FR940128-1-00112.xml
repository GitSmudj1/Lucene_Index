    <textblock>Decomposition</textblock>
    <textblock>. A finding of any</textblock>
    <textblock>organoleptically detectable decomposition</textblock>
    <textblock>should result in the organoleptic examination</textblock>
    <textblock>of the entire lot. If decomposition is</textblock>
    <textblock>detected in more than 2.5 percent of the fish</textblock>
    <textblock>in the lot, the processor should perform a</textblock>
    <textblock>histamine analysis on a representative sample</textblock>
    <textblock>of fish from the lot. The results should be</textblock>
    <textblock>treated in accordance with section 3.a.3. of</textblock>
    <textblock>this Appendix.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Processing Critical Control Point.</textblock>
    <textblock>Products that are undergoing processing</textblock>
    <textblock>should not be exposed to ambient temperatures</textblock>
    <textblock>of 40</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (4.4</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) or higher for more than a</textblock>
    <textblock>cumulative total of 4 hours. Processors</textblock>
    <textblock>should ensure that this requirement is met by</textblock>
    <textblock>monitoring and recording, at least every 2</textblock>
    <textblock>hours, the length of time that the product is</textblock>
    <textblock>exposed to temperatures of 40</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (4.4</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) or</textblock>
    <textblock>higher.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Additional Critical Control Points.</textblock>
    <textblock>The guidelines relating to cooked ready</textblock>
    <textblock>to eat fish and fishery products specified by</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix A, sections 6 and 7 should also be</textblock>
    <textblock>applied to scombroid toxin forming species,</textblock>
    <textblock>where applicable.</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix C to Part 123_[Reserved]</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix D to Part 123_Product Integrity</textblock>
    <textblock>1. General guidelines for product integrity.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Product integrity critical control</textblock>
    <textblock>points.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. General Guidelines for Product Integrity</textblock>
    <textblock>This Appendix provides guidance on how a</textblock>
    <textblock>processor can use an HACCP-based approach to</textblock>
    <textblock>ensure that all fish and fishery products are</textblock>
    <textblock>in compliance with the economic adulteration</textblock>
    <textblock>and misbranding provisions of the Federal</textblock>
    <textblock>Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (sections 402(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>and 403, respectively). This guidance</textblock>
    <textblock>applies to controlling economic factors</textblock>
    <textblock>including the identity of species, weight,</textblock>
    <textblock>count and size, and the percentage of</textblock>
    <textblock>valuable constituents. These factors must be</textblock>
    <textblock>accurately represented on the label and</textblock>
    <textblock>labeling of a food.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Product Integrity Critical Control Points</textblock>
    <textblock>Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point</textblock>
    <textblock>(HACCP) plans prepared in accordance with</textblock>
    <textblock>subpart A of 21 CFR part 123 will typically include the following critical control</textblock>
    <textblock>points, as appropriate, that can be used to</textblock>
    <textblock>ensure the economic integrity of the product:</textblock>
    <textblock>a. Receipt of Raw Material</textblock>
    <textblock>A processor must ensure that the fish</textblock>
    <textblock>and fishery products that it receives are</textblock>
    <textblock>correctly identified as to species at the</textblock>
    <textblock>point of receipt into its processing</textblock>
    <textblock>facility. Methods used for identification</textblock>
    <textblock>upon receipt may include, but are not limited</textblock>
    <textblock>to:</textblock>
    <textblock>1.</textblock>
    <textblock>Exams.</textblock>
    <textblock>Physical examination of the</textblock>
    <textblock>seafood species by qualified personnel;</textblock>
    <textblock>2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Evaluations.</textblock>
    <textblock>Laboratory evaluation</textblock>
    <textblock>(e.g., protein chromatography); and</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Acceptance of species identity as</textblock>
    <textblock>certified by a supplier under either a</textblock>
    <textblock>Limited or a General and Continuing Guaranty,</textblock>
    <textblock>as provided for by section 303(c)(2) of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 CFR</textblock>
    <textblock>7.12 and 7.13).</textblock>
    <textblock>b. Labeling-Economic Value</textblock>
    <textblock>A processor must ensure that the</textblock>
    <textblock>finished product labels, labeling, and</textblock>
    <textblock>invoices accurately represent the weight,</textblock>
    <textblock>count, and size of the product, as well as the presence and amount of any valuable constituents. An example would be the</textblock>
    <textblock>handling of shrimp and breading material to</textblock>
    <textblock>make breaded shrimp. The processor must</textblock>
    <textblock>ensure that the shrimp has not been</textblock>
    <textblock>adulterated by the addition of water, and</textblock>
    <textblock>that the valuable constituents are present at</textblock>
    <textblock>levels that are consistent with FDA standards</textblock>
    <textblock>of identity (21 CFR part 161) and compliance</textblock>
    <textblock>policy guides. The processor thus should</textblock>
    <textblock>provide for monitoring of the level of the</textblock>
    <textblock>valuable constituents throughout receipt,</textblock>
    <textblock>processing, and distribution to ensure that:</textblock>
    <textblock>1.</textblock>
    <textblock>Identification.</textblock>
    <textblock>The species is</textblock>
    <textblock>correctly identified by its common or usual</textblock>
    <textblock>name and is so represented on the label and</textblock>
    <textblock>labeling. Guidance in selecting the correct</textblock>
    <textblock>common or usual name of a species is provided</textblock>
    <textblock>by the FDA Fish List. Specific requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>are given in 21 CFR 101.18 and 21 CFR part</textblock>
    <textblock>161.</textblock>
    <textblock>2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Valuable constituents.</textblock>
    <textblock>The valuable</textblock>
    <textblock>constituents of the product are not omitted</textblock>
    <textblock>or abstracted from the product (e.g., breaded</textblock>
    <textblock>shrimp contains the required weight ratio of</textblock>
    <textblock>shrimp to breading and, if appropriate, shrimp of the size and weight specified on</textblock>
    <textblock>the label or labeling).</textblock>
    <textblock>3.</textblock>
    <textblock>Substitution.</textblock>
    <textblock>No substance is</textblock>
    <textblock>substituted wholly or in part for the</textblock>
    <textblock>valuable constituent (e.g., through added</textblock>
    <textblock>water or glazing, or substitution of crab</textblock>
    <textblock>flavored surimi for crab meat in a product</textblock>
    <textblock>labeled as crab cake).</textblock>
    <textblock>4.</textblock>
    <textblock>Damage or inferiority.</textblock>
    <textblock>Damage or</textblock>
    <textblock>inferiority is not concealed in any manner</textblock>
    <textblock>(e.g., through bleaching or coloring of</textblock>
    <textblock>product to conceal its true nature or</textblock>
    <textblock>condition of wholesomeness).</textblock>
    <textblock>5.</textblock>
    <textblock>Product adulteration.</textblock>
    <textblock>No substance</textblock>
    <textblock>is added to, or mixed with, the product to</textblock>
    <textblock>increase its bulk or weight or to reduce its</textblock>
    <textblock>quality, or make it appear of better or</textblock>
    <textblock>greater value than it is (e.g., through</textblock>
    <textblock>adding water to a product by chemical or</textblock>
    <textblock>other means).</textblock>
