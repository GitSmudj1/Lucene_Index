    <textblock>According to petitioners, the problems that the Department discovered during verification are significant and pervasive. (See,</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment 2</textblock>
    <textblock>through</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment 8</textblock>
    <textblock>for the specific issues raised by petitioners.) Petitioners contend that, because of the serious nature of the deficiencies in KT's cost data, the Department cannot, and should not, develop an alternative basis for constructing KT's production costs. Rather, petitioners argue that the Department should resort to total BIA. In selecting the BIA rate, petitioners assert that the Department should use the highest rate possible, which is the highest margin contained in the petition.</textblock>
    <textblock>KT argues that the Department is authorized to use BIA if a party ``refuses or is unable to produce information requested in a timely manner and in the form required,'' or if a party ``significantly impedes an investigation.'' KT asserts that, in order for these conditions to be satisfied, the Department must have requested the information and the respondent must have either failed to supply the information or have been unable to comply with the request. Furthermore, KT argues that, even where the Department has requested information, it is not authorized to use BIA unless it has provided respondent with a warning and an opportunity to correct any deficiencies. KT asserts that, since it (1) provided all of the information requested by the Department, (2) in no way impeded this investigation, and (3) did not have an opportunity to correct perceived deficiencies, there is no basis for the Department to resort to any form of BIA.</textblock>
    <textblock>KT claims that if the Department determines that it is appropriate to use BIA for purposes of the final determination, it should use a non-punitive, partial BIA, to reallocate KT's fabrication costs. (See,</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment 3,</textblock>
    <textblock>below.) According to KT, since KT has fully cooperated with the Department throughout this investigation, there is no reason for the Department to completely disregard KT's entire cost submission.</textblock>
    <textblock>DOC Position:</textblock>
    <textblock>We agree with KT. The Department has determined that KT reported the majority of its production cost with no material problems. (</textblock>
    <textblock>See</textblock>
    <textblock>, cost verification report, dated December 9, 1993.) Because we have determined the KT's cost submission is reliable, there is no reason to completely disregard KT's entire cost submission. (</textblock>
    <textblock>See</textblock>
    <textblock>, comments below for a discussion regarding specific issues of validity.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment 2:</textblock>
    <textblock>KT contends that the Department should accept the material costs reported in its September 13, 1993, response. KT argues that the Department verified that KT accurately reported in this response its actual production quantities and actual material costs incurred during the POI. According to KT, since the submitted product-specific material costs are the result of actual material expenses divided by actual production quantities, there is no basis for suspecting that the reported per unit material costs are incorrect. KT also maintains that its calculation of steel coil costs on a grade-by-grade basis is appropriate because the cost of the coil did not vary based on gauge.</textblock>
    <textblock>Additionally, KT maintains that, contrary to petitioners' assertions, product-specific material costs reported in its September 13 submission are different from product-specific material costs reported in its October 25 submission for a legitimate reason_because the methodologies used in each submission were different.</textblock>
    <textblock>Finally, KT notes that although the weighted-average material expenses decreased slightly between the September and October responses, the percentage of the five most frequently sold home-market products that were sold at prices below the cost of production remained exactly the same, regardless of which response's material costs are used. Thus, KT maintains that the difference between the two submissions in material expenses does not materially affect the margin calculation.</textblock>
    <textblock>According to petitioners, since KT did not submit actual costs on a product-specific basis, acceptance of its cost data would be improper and inconsistent with the Department's normal practice. Thus, petitioners contend that KT's cost submission should be rejected.</textblock>
