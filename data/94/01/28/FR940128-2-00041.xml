    <textblock>Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended; section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854).</textblock>
    <textblock>In a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated December 23, 1993 between the Governments of the United States and Costa Rica, agreement was reached to amend and extend their current bilateral textile agreement through December 31, 1995.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the letter published below, the Chairman of CITA directs the Commissioner of Customs to amend the current restraint period for Category 447 to begin on March 1, 1993 and extend through December 31, 1993 at an increased level. As a result, the limit for Category 447, which is currently filled, will re-open. In addition, limits are being established for Categories 340/640, 342/642, 347/348, 443 and 447 for the period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994. Guaranteed access levels (GALs) are being established for Categories 340/640, 342/642 347/348 and 443 the period January 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994; and Category 447 for the period February 1, 1994 through December 31, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Textile products in Category 447, produced or manufactured in Costa Rica and exported from Costa Rica on and after February 1, 1994 shall require a visa.</textblock>
    <textblock>Beginning on February 1, 1994, the U.S. Customs Service will start signing the first section of the form ITA-370P for shipments of U.S. formed and cut parts in Category 447 that are destined for Costa Rica and subject to the GAL established for Category 447 for the period beginning on February 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994. These products are governed by Harmonized Tariff item number 9802.00.8015 and chapter 61 Statistical Note 5 and chapter 62 Statistical Note 3 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Interested parties should be aware that shipments of cut parts in Category 447 must be accompanied by a form ITA-370P, signed by a U.S. Customs officer, prior to export from the United States for assembly in Costa Rica in order to qualify for entry under the Special Access Program.</textblock>

    <textblock>Commissioner of Customs,</textblock>
    <textblock>Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dear Commissioner: This directive amends, but does not cancel the directive issued to you on June 24, 1993 by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements. This directive concerns imports of wool textile products in Category 447, produced or manufactured in Costa Rica and exported during the period beginning on February 25, 1993 and extending through February 24, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Effective on February 1, 1994, you are directed to amend the restraint period for Category 447 to begin on March 1, 1993 and extend through December 31, 1993 at a level of 10,000 dozen</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on December 9, 1993; pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated December 23, 1993, between the Governments of the United States and Costa Rica; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on February 1, 1994, entry into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton, wool and man-made fiber textile products in the following categories, produced or manufactured in Costa Rica and exported during the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994, in excess of the following restraint limits:</textblock>
    <textblock>Imports charged to these category limits for the periods January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993 and March 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993 (Category 447) shall be charged against those levels of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balances. In the event the limits established for those periods have been exhausted by previous entries, such goods shall be subject to the levels set forth in this directive.</textblock>
    <textblock>The limits set forth above are subject to adjustment in the future pursuant to the provisions of the MOU dated December 23, 1993 between the Governments of the United States and Costa Rica.</textblock>
    <textblock>Also effective on February 1, 1994, you are directed to amend further the directive dated May 15, 1990 to require a visa for textile products in Category 447, produced or manufactured in Costa Rica and exported from Costa Rica on and after February 1, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Additionally, pursuant to the December 23, 1993 MOU; and under the terms of the Special Access Program, as set forth in 51 FR 21208 (June 11, 1986), 52 FR 26057 (July 10, 1987) and 54 FR 50425 (December 6, 1989), effective on February 1, 1994, guaranteed access levels have been established for properly certified cotton, wool and man-made fiber textile products in the following categories which are assembled in Costa Rica from fabric formed and cut in the United States and re-exported to the United States from Costa Rica during the periods beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994:</textblock>
    <textblock>Effective on February 1, 1994, a guaranteed access level of 4,000 dozen is being established for Category 447 for the period beginning on February 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994. Beginning on February 1, 1994, the U.S. Customs Service is directed to start signing the first section of form ITA-370P for shipments of U.S. formed and cut parts in Category 447 that are destined for Costa Rica and re-exported to the United States on and after February 1, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any shipment for entry under the Special Access Program which is not accompanied by a valid and correct certification and Export Declaration in accordance with the provisions of the certification requirements established in the directive of May 15, 1990, shall be denied entry unless the Government of Costa Rica authorizes the entry and any charges to the appropriate specific limit. Any shipment which is declared for entry under the Special Access Program but found not to qualify shall be denied entry into the United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).</textblock>
