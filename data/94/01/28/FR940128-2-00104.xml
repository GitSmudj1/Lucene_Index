    <textblock>Immplentation of Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act, GN Docket No. 93-252, First Report and Order.</textblock>

    <textblock>The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, Public Law 103-66, Title VI, Section 6002(b), 107 Stat 312, 395 (1993), amended Sections 3(n) and 332 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 153(n) and 332, to create a comprehensive regulatory framework for all mobile radio services. Under the amended statute, certain private land mobile radio licensees will be reclassified as ``commercial mobile radio service'' licensees will be treated as common carriers subject to the foreign ownership and control restrictions of Section 310(b) of the Communications Act. A ``grandfathering'' provision, however, permits the Commission to grant waivers of Section 310(b) to private land mobile licensees that petition the Commission by February 10, 1994. This present action clarifies the filing procedures for such petitions and reminds all potentially affected private radio licensees of the February 10, 1994 filing deadline.</textblock>
