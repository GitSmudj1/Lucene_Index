    <textblock>Continuous monitoring ensures that temperature fluctuations</textblock>
    <textblock>above 40</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (4.4</textblock>
    <textblock>○C), if any, as a result of circumstances such</textblock>
    <textblock>as heavy cooler loading, frequent cooler entry, or power</textblock>
    <textblock>failures, are quickly detected. The guideline for cooked, ready-to-eat</textblock>
    <textblock>products, in Appendix A, section 6, describes alternative ways to continuously monitor the temperature. A temperature-recording device can show both the high temperature and the length of time that refrigeration unit was operating at that temperature. Maximum-indicating thermometers and high</textblock>
    <textblock>temperature alarms also show that the critical limit has been</textblock>
    <textblock>exceeded but cannot show the duration of the deviation.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consequently, when a maximum-indicating thermometer or high</textblock>
    <textblock>temperature alarm reveals a deviation, the processor will need to</textblock>
    <textblock>assume loss of control since the last time that the measurements</textblock>
    <textblock>displayed by the instruments were checked, unless reasonable</textblock>
    <textblock>evidence exists to the contrary. The more frequent such checks</textblock>
    <textblock>are made, the lower the risk to which the processor is exposed.</textblock>
    <textblock>During periods when the refrigeration unit is not frequently</textblock>
    <textblock>entered and the load is constant, such as overnight, it is</textblock>
    <textblock>reasonable to reduce the frequency. However, during periods of</textblock>
    <textblock>heavy use and frequent entry, the frequency should be increased.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing to require in §123.10(a)(15) that the</textblock>
    <textblock>processor ensure that persons with sores or illnesses that</textblock>
    <textblock>present an increased risk for product contamination are excluded</textblock>
    <textblock>from those areas of processing where such contamination is</textblock>
    <textblock>likely. Employees can serve as a reservoir of foodborne</textblock>
    <textblock>diseases, such as salmonellosis, shigellosis, and hepatitis, that</textblock>
    <textblock>can be passed on to the consumer through the fecal-oral route.</textblock>
    <textblock>Additionally, open sores, boils, or infected wounds present the</textblock>
    <textblock>potential for contamination of the food with such pathogenic</textblock>
    <textblock>microorganisms as</textblock>
    <textblock>Staphylococcus aureus.</textblock>
    <textblock>Employees with</textblock>
    <textblock>suspicious illnesses or sores can be effectively screened upon</textblock>
    <textblock>arrival at the processing facility with minimal personal</textblock>
    <textblock>intrusion (Refs. 22, 74, and 84).</textblock>
    <textblock>In §123.10(c), the agency is proposing to require that such</textblock>
    <textblock>screening, and documentation of the screening, take place daily.</textblock>
    <textblock>This frequency will ensure that changing health conditions of the</textblock>
    <textblock>employees are not missed.</textblock>
    <textblock>In §123.10(a)(16), the agency is proposing to require that</textblock>
    <textblock>the processor ensure that toilet facilities are available and</textblock>
    <textblock>maintained in a sanitary condition and in good repair, and that</textblock>
    <textblock>these facilities provide for proper disposal of the sewage.</textblock>
    <textblock>Toilet facilities eliminate from the processing environment</textblock>
    <textblock>pathogenic microorganisms shed in fecal material. Where fecal</textblock>
    <textblock>material is not properly conveyed from the processing plant to an</textblock>
    <textblock>acceptable treatment facility, restroom floors and grounds around</textblock>
    <textblock>the processing facility can become contaminated with pathogens.</textblock>
    <textblock>Foot traffic over the affected areas can introduce pathogens to</textblock>
    <textblock>the processing room and cause product contamination. Insanitary</textblock>
    <textblock>toilet facilities can also increase the potential for</textblock>
    <textblock>contamination of employees' hands and, ultimately, the product</textblock>
    <textblock>(Refs. 64 and 74).</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing to require at §123.10(c) that the toilet</textblock>
    <textblock>facilities be inspected, and the inspection be documented, to</textblock>
    <textblock>ensure that they function properly and are in a sanitary</textblock>
    <textblock>condition at least every day. Ordinarily this inspection should</textblock>
    <textblock>be performed before each day's operation to ensure that the</textblock>
    <textblock>facility is ready at the beginning of the day.</textblock>
    <textblock>In §123.10(a)(17), the agency is proposing to require that</textblock>
    <textblock>the processor ensure that no pests are present in the processing</textblock>
    <textblock>area. Pests, such as rodents, birds, and insects carry a variety</textblock>
    <textblock>of human disease agents, which they can introduce to the</textblock>
    <textblock>processing environment (Refs. 63, 64, 73, and 84). Additionally,</textblock>
    <textblock>their feces constitutes filth which can contaminate the food. A</textblock>
    <textblock>daily inspection of the processing facility, as proposed in</textblock>
    <textblock>§123.10(c), serves to assess the effectiveness of the</textblock>
    <textblock>processor's pest control activities and redirect them where</textblock>
    <textblock>necessary.</textblock>
    <textblock>In §123.10(a)(18), the agency is proposing to require that</textblock>
    <textblock>the processor ensure that the plant is designed to minimize risk</textblock>
    <textblock>of contamination of the food. Proper construction is essential</textblock>
    <textblock>if the other sanitary measures that FDA is proposing to require</textblock>
    <textblock>are to be successful. It includes the isolation of incompatible</textblock>
    <textblock>operations, such as the handling of raw materials and the</textblock>
    <textblock>processing of cooked products (Refs. 71, 74, 87, and 88). A</textblock>
    <textblock>periodic inspection of the facility for structural defects,</textblock>
    <textblock>product flow, and general building condition is necessary to</textblock>
    <textblock>ensure that these attributes do not pose an increased potential</textblock>
    <textblock>for product contamination. In §123.10(c)(3), the agency is</textblock>
    <textblock>proposing to require that such controls be performed and</textblock>
    <textblock>documented with sufficient frequency to ensure control.</textblock>
