    <textblock>In its final determination, the Department found that critical circumstances exist with respect to exports of SSWR from Brazil by Acos Finos Piratini S.A. and Acos Villares S.A. However, on January 21, 1994, the International Trade Commission (ITC) notified the Department that retroactive assessment of antidumping duties is not necessary to prevent recurrence of material injury from massive imports over a short period. As a result of the ITC's determination, pursuant to section 735(c)(3) of the Act, we shall order Customs to terminate the retroactive suspension of liquidation of entries of subject merchandise exported from Brazil by Piratini and Villares, and to release any bond or other security and refund any cash deposit required under section 733(e)(2) with respect to all entries of SSWR exported from Brazil by Piratini and Villares, and entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption prior to August 5, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>This notice constitutes the antidumping duty order with respect to certain stainless steel wire rods from Brazil, pursuant to section 736(a) of the Act. Interested parties may contact the Central Records Unit, room B-099 of the Main Commerce Building, for copies of an updated list of antidumping duty orders currently in effect.</textblock>
    <textblock>This order is published in accordance with section 736(a) of the Act and 19 CFR 353.21.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dated: January 25, 1994.</textblock>
