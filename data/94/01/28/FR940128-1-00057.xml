    <textblock>3. Time and Temperature</textblock>
    <textblock>The guidelines advise, in proposed Appendix A, section 3. e., f., g., and h., that HACCP plans prepared in accordance with</textblock>
    <textblock>subpart A of part 123 will normally identify cooling after</textblock>
    <textblock>cooking, processing after cooking, final product cooling, and</textblock>
    <textblock>refrigerated storage, as critical control points. The potential</textblock>
    <textblock>exists for some pathogenic microorganisms to survive the cooking</textblock>
    <textblock>process, regardless of the controls that are in place at that</textblock>
    <textblock>step. Likewise, despite a processor's efforts to minimize</textblock>
    <textblock>recontamination of the cooked product with pathogens, the</textblock>
    <textblock>potential exists for some pathogens to be reintroduced. For</textblock>
    <textblock>these reasons, it is imperative that exposure of the product</textblock>
    <textblock>after the cooking process to temperatures that permit the growth</textblock>
    <textblock>of pathogens be kept to a minimum, since larger numbers are</textblock>
    <textblock>frequently associated with a greater potential for disease.</textblock>
    <textblock>To control hazards as required by part 123, subpart A, the</textblock>
    <textblock>process must take steps to restrict time/temperature abuse of the</textblock>
    <textblock>cooked product to the point that pathogens such as</textblock>
    <textblock>Salmonella</textblock>
    <textblock>spp.</textblock>
    <textblock>do not enter the rapid (logarithmic) phase of growth. By</textblock>
    <textblock>restricting pathogen growth to the slow (lag) phase, pathogen</textblock>
    <textblock>numbers should remain constant or increase only slightly.</textblock>
    <textblock>Proposed Appendix A, section 6.a. provides a way to control</textblock>
    <textblock>the growth of pathogens immediately after cooking. It advises</textblock>
    <textblock>that, after cooking, the product should be cooled from 140</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (60</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) to 70</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (21.1</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) within two hours. This time/temperature</textblock>
    <textblock>combination is based on the upper limit for growth (i.e., 140</textblock>
    <textblock>○F)</textblock>
    <textblock>and the lower limit for rapid growth (i.e., 70</textblock>
    <textblock>○F) of such</textblock>
    <textblock>mesophilic pathogens as</textblock>
    <textblock>Salmonella spp.</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>S. aureus</textblock>
    <textblock>, and the</textblock>
    <textblock>typical length of the lag phase for the former microorganism</textblock>
    <textblock>(Refs. 23, 85, and 115). However, 70</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (21.1</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) will not fully</textblock>
    <textblock>control the growth of psychrotrophic pathogens. Consequently,</textblock>
    <textblock>further cooling from 70</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (21.1</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) to 40</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (4.4</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) within 4</textblock>
    <textblock>additional hours is advisable, based on the minimum growth</textblock>
    <textblock>temperatures of such psychrotropic pathogens as</textblock>
    <textblock>L. monocytogenes,</textblock>
    <textblock>Salmonella spp.</textblock>
    <textblock>, and</textblock>
    <textblock>S. aureus</textblock>
    <textblock>, and the lag time of</textblock>
    <textblock>Salmonella</textblock>
    <textblock>spp.</textblock>
    <textblock>(Refs. 23, 78, and 79).</textblock>
    <textblock>These cooling recommendations are generally consistent with</textblock>
    <textblock>those of the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of USDA</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 115) and the National Food Processors Association (NFPA)</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 78). FDA invites comments on the specifics in App. A,</textblock>
    <textblock>section 6.a. In those instances where further processing takes place</textblock>
    <textblock>before the achievement of the 70</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (21.1</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) or the 40</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (4.4</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) temperatures, further reduction in temperature need not take</textblock>
    <textblock>place. There is no need for production delays when in-process</textblock>
    <textblock>storage times are normally less than the 2 or 6 hours needed to</textblock>
    <textblock>achieve each of these temperatures.</textblock>
    <textblock>The time/temperature parameters employed to control the</textblock>
    <textblock>microbiological hazards associated with cooling after cooking can</textblock>
    <textblock>be confirmed by a program of routine time and temperature</textblock>
    <textblock>monitoring (Appendix A, section 6.a.1.). Real time documentation</textblock>
    <textblock>of this monitoring should be done to facilitate management and</textblock>
    <textblock>regulatory review.</textblock>
    <textblock>Alternately, the ability of the firm's processing procedures</textblock>
    <textblock>to consistently achieve the appropriate time/temperature</textblock>
    <textblock>parameters can be confirmed through scientifically conducted</textblock>
    <textblock>time/temperature studies that take into consideration the range</textblock>
    <textblock>of processing variations encountered at the firm. Examples of</textblock>
    <textblock>processing variations include product size, e.g., the range of</textblock>
    <textblock>shrimp sizes that the firm typically processes; the temperature</textblock>
    <textblock>of the cooling medium, e.g., the highest temperature normally</textblock>
    <textblock>experienced in the firm's cooling unit; and the amount of product</textblock>
    <textblock>normally placed in the cooling unit.</textblock>
    <textblock>In some instances in-process time/temperature monitoring may</textblock>
    <textblock>be impractical or needlessly redundant, particularly in</textblock>
    <textblock>continuous processing systems. A scientifically conducted study</textblock>
    <textblock>is especially appropriate for such situations, where it can be</textblock>
    <textblock>assured that in all plausible situations the time/temperature</textblock>
    <textblock>parameters will be met. Documentation and retention of the</textblock>
    <textblock>conduct and results of this study is required by §123.8.</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix A, section 6.b. advises how processors can ensure</textblock>
    <textblock>that microbiological hazards associated with postcooking</textblock>
    <textblock>processing can be controlled. It advises that products not be</textblock>
    <textblock>exposed to ambient temperatures of 40</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (4.4</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) or higher for</textblock>
    <textblock>more than 4 hours during postcooking processing, again based on</textblock>
    <textblock>the minimum growth temperature of such psychrotropic pathogens as</textblock>
    <textblock>L. monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>and on the normal lag phase of such mesophilic</textblock>
    <textblock>pathogens as</textblock>
    <textblock>Salmonella spp.</textblock>
    <textblock>The agency recognizes that, for</textblock>
    <textblock>many products, manipulation of the product after cooking, while</textblock>
    <textblock>undesirable from the standpoint of microbiological</textblock>
    <textblock>recontamination, is necessary for many cooked, ready-to-eat</textblock>
    <textblock>products. It is often impractical to perform this manipulation</textblock>
    <textblock>under refrigerated conditions. Consequently, the product will be</textblock>
    <textblock>exposed to some combination of time and temperature that may</textblock>
    <textblock>allow for microbiological growth. The recommended conditions</textblock>
    <textblock>will minimize the growth of pathogenic microorganisms and the</textblock>
    <textblock>production of heat stable toxins (e.g., staphylococcal</textblock>
    <textblock>enterotoxin).</textblock>
    <textblock>The ability of the firm's processing procedures to</textblock>
    <textblock>consistently achieve its time/temperature parameters can be</textblock>
    <textblock>confirmed by monitoring the length of time that the product is</textblock>
    <textblock>exposed to such ambient temperatures. Documentation of</textblock>
    <textblock>time/temperature monitoring must be in accordance with §123.8.</textblock>
    <textblock>to facilitate management and regulatory review.</textblock>
