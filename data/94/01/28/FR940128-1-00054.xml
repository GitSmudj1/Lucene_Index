    <textblock>Under proposed §123.28(b)(2) and (b)(3), the shellstock tag</textblock>
    <textblock>from a licensed harvester or certified processor, or the bill of</textblock>
    <textblock>lading accompanying bulk shipments, will contain the information</textblock>
    <textblock>required under proposed §1240.60(b) and thus document whether</textblock>
    <textblock>the shellfish are from an acceptable source.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed requirement §123.28(b) that only shellfish</textblock>
    <textblock>drawn from such acceptable sources can be processed will place a</textblock>
    <textblock>premium on properly tagged products from shellfish dealers that</textblock>
    <textblock>States or nations that participate in NSSP have certified.</textblock>
    <textblock>The agency is further proposing to require in §123.28(c)</textblock>
    <textblock>that shucked products be subject to the same requirements that</textblock>
    <textblock>apply to shellstock. FDA is doing so because the safety of</textblock>
    <textblock>shucked shellfish products, like shellstock, depends on the</textblock>
    <textblock>quality of the water where they are grown. Therefore, the same</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements are needed.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is further proposing to require in §123.28(d) that the</textblock>
    <textblock>processor maintain records that document that each lot of</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish meets the tagging or labeling requirements in</textblock>
    <textblock>§123.28 (b) or (c) (see Refs. 104 and 108). The information that</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing to require to be maintained in records simply</textblock>
    <textblock>reflects these requirements. Permanent records are needed to</textblock>
    <textblock>demonstrate that processors are controlling the origin of the</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish they process. In addition, permanent records will</textblock>
    <textblock>facilitate epidemiological investigations by allowing complete</textblock>
    <textblock>product traceability to the source of origin.</textblock>
    <textblock>The protection of shellfish consumers also requires that</textblock>
    <textblock>domestic and imported products be treated equally. While</textblock>
    <textblock>imported raw molluscan shellfish are subject to the same</textblock>
    <textblock>standards as domestic shellfish with regard to adulteration and</textblock>
    <textblock>misbranding, Federal law does not require that imported shellfish</textblock>
    <textblock>come from waters that were classified by a public health</textblock>
    <textblock>authority. This double standard is unfair to domestic</textblock>
    <textblock>processors, and both ISSC and industry representatives have urged</textblock>
    <textblock>the Federal Government to address this problem (Refs. 111 and</textblock>
    <textblock>112). While virtually all States have chosen to reject imported</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish that are not tagged as coming from classified waters</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 113), it is known that such shellfish nonetheless enter</textblock>
    <textblock>interstate commerce (Ref. 107). Untagged imports originating</textblock>
    <textblock>from uncertified producers compromise the effectiveness of</textblock>
    <textblock>seafood safety programs (Ref. 7, p. 73) and product traceability.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, FDA is proposing that all raw shellfish products</textblock>
    <textblock>either from domestic or foreign origin must comply with the</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements in part 123 and §1240.60.</textblock>
    <textblock>Thus, if §123.28(b), for example, is adopted, it will mean</textblock>
    <textblock>that only those molluscan shellfish that are harvested in a</textblock>
    <textblock>foreign country that has a program that incorporates the type of</textblock>
    <textblock>measures set out in the NSSP for approving growing waters will be</textblock>
    <textblock>appropriate for processing. Such a program will need to include</textblock>
    <textblock>measures that provide for water classification, monitoring, and</textblock>
    <textblock>other related activities if it is to ensure that the growing</textblock>
    <textblock>waters that it approves are safe, and thus that the shellfish</textblock>
    <textblock>that are drawn from such waters are not adulterated. FDA has</textblock>
    <textblock>found that the best way to establish that a foreign country's</textblock>
    <textblock>program meets this standard is through the development of an MOU</textblock>
    <textblock>between the agency and that country. Currently, such agreements</textblock>
    <textblock>exist with Australia, Canada, Chile, England, Iceland, Japan,</textblock>
    <textblock>Republic of Korea, Mexico, and New Zealand.</textblock>
    <textblock>In summary, FDA anticipates that these proposed requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>will improve the safety of raw molluscan shellfish by</textblock>
    <textblock>establishing uniform requirements for domestic and imported</textblock>
    <textblock>products and prohibiting interstate movement of shellfish that is</textblock>
    <textblock>not properly tagged to demonstrate that it came from an</textblock>
    <textblock>appropriate harvesting area.</textblock>
    <textblock>The effectiveness of State shellfish sanitation programs and</textblock>
    <textblock>the NSSP will be strengthened by the proposed mandatory tagging,</textblock>
    <textblock>labeling, and recordkeeping requirements, which will allow</textblock>
    <textblock>complete product traceability to its source of origin. Should</textblock>
    <textblock>illnesses occur, product traceability will facilitate a rapid</textblock>
    <textblock>determination of when a problem occurred and allow immediate</textblock>
    <textblock>remedial actions to restore public health controls. Also,</textblock>
    <textblock>requiring proper tagging or labeling will place a premium on</textblock>
    <textblock>State and foreign shellfish sanitation and processor</textblock>
    <textblock>certification programs.</textblock>
