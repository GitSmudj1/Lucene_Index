    <textblock>Persons wishing to be observers representing United States national non-governmental organizations must receive prior approval of the Fish and Wildlife Service. After granting of that approval, a national non-governmental organization is eligible to register with the CITES Secretariat to participate in the COP as an observer. Requests for such approval should include evidence of technical qualification in protection, conservation or management of wild fauna and flora, on the part of both the organization and the individual representative. Organizations previously approved by the Service shall submit a request but do not need to provide as detailed information concerning their qualifications as those seeking approval for the first time. Organizations seeking approval for the first time should detail their experience in the protection, conservation, or management of wild fauna and/or flora, as well as their purposes for wishing to participate in the COP as an observer. Such requests should be sent to the Office of Management Authority (OMA; see</textblock>

    <textblock>notices and other information pertaining to COP9. A list of organizations approved for COP9 observer status will be available from OMA just prior to COP9.</textblock>
