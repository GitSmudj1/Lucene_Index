    <textblock>Oven temperatures for hot processing ranged from 90 to 240</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (32 to 116</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) and from 38 to 125</textblock>
    <textblock>○F (4.4 to 52</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) for cold</textblock>
    <textblock>processing. Water-phase salt content in hot-process products</textblock>
    <textblock>ranged from 0.88 to 27.5 percent and in cold-process products</textblock>
    <textblock>from 1.33 to 18.1 percent. Twenty-eight firms (43.7 percent)</textblock>
    <textblock>vacuum packed cold-process products, but 60.7 percent of those</textblock>
    <textblock>firms did not test final products for water-phase salt content or</textblock>
    <textblock>for residual sodium nitrite. Twenty-five firms (39.1 percent)</textblock>
    <textblock>vacuum packed hot-process products, but 68 percent of those firms</textblock>
    <textblock>did not test final products for water-phase salt content or for</textblock>
    <textblock>residual sodium nitrite. Seventy-five percent of the firms</textblock>
    <textblock>surveyed did not test final products for water-phase salt content</textblock>
    <textblock>or for residual sodium nitrite, where used. Since this survey</textblock>
    <textblock>was conducted, the frequency of FDA inspections of smoked fish</textblock>
    <textblock>establishments has been increased over 50 percent each year.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, FDA is providing guidance on the appropriate</textblock>
    <textblock>parameters for processing smoked fishery products in Appendix 1</textblock>
    <textblock>to this document.</textblock>
    <textblock>The guidance addresses critical control points that apply to</textblock>
    <textblock>these products as a class and that will typically be identified</textblock>
    <textblock>in the HACCP plans of most processors of smoke and smoke-flavored</textblock>
    <textblock>products. The guidance also addresses ways of controlling</textblock>
    <textblock>hazards at these critical control points.</textblock>
    <textblock>The key processing parameters that must be controlled to</textblock>
    <textblock>ensure the safety of these products involve time, temperature,</textblock>
    <textblock>and salinity. While a range of time-temperature-salinity (TTS)</textblock>
    <textblock>values will provide a safe product, there are now known safety</textblock>
    <textblock>minimums for these values that have been developed through years</textblock>
    <textblock>of research. Processors whose TTS values fall below these</textblock>
    <textblock>minimums do not produce a safe product and shift much of the</textblock>
    <textblock>burden of preventing botulism toxin outgrowth to those who take</textblock>
    <textblock>possession of these products after they leave the processing</textblock>
    <textblock>plant, including the ultimate consumer. This burden includes,</textblock>
    <textblock>among other things, maintaining strict temperature control at</textblock>
    <textblock>40</textblock>
    <textblock>○F or lower even though it is known that many commercial and</textblock>
    <textblock>home refrigerators are unable to maintain this temperature (Ref.</textblock>
    <textblock>201).</textblock>
    <textblock>These TTS minimums are known to produce a marketable</textblock>
    <textblock>product, because there are processors that operate in conformance</textblock>
    <textblock>with them. Moreover, because they are minimums, these values</textblock>
    <textblock>allow for the production of a variety of products, such as</textblock>
    <textblock>different types of lox with varying amounts of saltiness, to suit</textblock>
    <textblock>different tastes.</textblock>
    <textblock>These minimum TTS values provide the only scientifically</textblock>
    <textblock>valid way developed to date of ensuring that no botulism toxin</textblock>
    <textblock>will be produced over the shelf life of the product under proper</textblock>
    <textblock>refrigeration conditions or under conditions of moderate</textblock>
    <textblock>temperature abuse. The minimum values, coupled with the</textblock>
    <textblock>sanitation practices proposed in this document, should also</textblock>
    <textblock>ensure against the presence of detectable</textblock>
    <textblock>L. monocytogenes.</textblock>
    <textblock>These minimum TTS values are being issued at this time as</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed guidance to ensure maximum flexibility. If these values</textblock>
    <textblock>are reflected in the HACCP plans that are required by proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>subpart A of 21 CFR part 123, and are being effectively</textblock>
    <textblock>implemented by the processor, the agency is likely to find that</textblock>
    <textblock>the plan and its implementation are adequate with regard to those</textblock>
    <textblock>critical limits and critical control points. The same holds true</textblock>
    <textblock>for the other types of controls recommended in the guidance.</textblock>
    <textblock>The agency is requesting comment on this approach, and on</textblock>
    <textblock>the following alternatives:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Issue all or part of the materials relating to smoked</textblock>
    <textblock>and smoke-flavored fishery products in Appendix 1 as regulations,</textblock>
    <textblock>rather than guidance. Given the public health concerns</textblock>
    <textblock>associated with these products and the scientific basis for the</textblock>
    <textblock>TTS minimums, it may well be appropriate to issue them as</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations. Such regulations would take into account advances</textblock>
    <textblock>in knowledge and technology by allowing processors to use</textblock>
    <textblock>alternative processing parameters so long as these alternatives were scientifically demonstrated to produce an equivalent level</textblock>
    <textblock>of safety. (Section 11 of the guidance relating to smoked and</textblock>
    <textblock>smoke-flavored fishery products in Appendix 1 contains such a</textblock>
    <textblock>feature.)</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Issue a performance standard as a regulation, while</textblock>
    <textblock>leaving the materials in Appendix 1 as guidelines on how</textblock>
    <textblock>processors could meet the performance standard. The likely</textblock>
    <textblock>performance standard would be, as suggested above (and included</textblock>
    <textblock>in section 11 of the guidance relating to smoked and smoke-</textblock>
    <textblock>flavored fishery products in Appendix 1): (a) for botulism, zero</textblock>
    <textblock>toxin production in the product during a time period through_and</textblock>
    <textblock>slightly beyond_the shelf life of the product, demonstrated</textblock>
    <textblock>through inoculated pack studies under normal and moderate abuse</textblock>
    <textblock>conditions; and (b) no detectable L. monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>in the final</textblock>
    <textblock>product.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Maintain the guidance relating to smoked and smoke-flavored fishery products in the FDA Fish and Fishery Products</textblock>
    <textblock>Hazards and Controls Guide and control safety through the HACCP</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements for all seafood in proposed subpart A.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA requests comment on which of these alternatives is most</textblock>
    <textblock>likely to ensure that smoked fish will be safe and is most</textblock>
    <textblock>consistent with the agency's obligations under the act. In the</textblock>
    <textblock>absence of a regulation or guideline, how can the agency best</textblock>
    <textblock>ensure that the results of the research that it has conducted</textblock>
    <textblock>will be available for use by the industry? FDA solicits comments</textblock>
    <textblock>on these and the matters raised above.</textblock>
    <textblock>N. Verification Issues</textblock>
    <textblock>As described in section IV.A. of this document, one of the</textblock>
    <textblock>NACMCF's seven HACCP principles involves verification that the</textblock>
    <textblock>HACCP system is working. NACMCF recommends that HACCP plans</textblock>
    <textblock>include procedures for verification of the HACCP system (Ref. 34,</textblock>
    <textblock>p. 200). FDA advises processors to consider adopting this</textblock>
    <textblock>recommendation, but has not proposed to require it because the</textblock>
    <textblock>agency expects verification to occur through: (1) A firm's</textblock>
    <textblock>consistency with the controls and limits to be provided by FDA in</textblock>
    <textblock>the HACCP guidance described in section VII.C. and M. of this</textblock>
    <textblock>document; (2) third-party technical assistance provided through</textblock>
    <textblock>trade associations, universities and government agencies; and (3)</textblock>
    <textblock>review of all HACCP monitoring records by trained individuals</textblock>
    <textblock>before distribution of product (see proposed §123.8(b)); the</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed corrective action requirements (see proposed §123.7),</textblock>
    <textblock>especially the provision for assessment of HACCP plans as a</textblock>
    <textblock>consequence of deviations (§123.7(a)(4)); the recommended use of</textblock>
    <textblock>process authorities for cooked, ready-to-eat products (see</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix A); the proposed general training requirements (see</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed §123.9); and inspector review during routine agency</textblock>
    <textblock>inspections. FDA invites comment on whether this approach is</textblock>
    <textblock>adequate to ensure that the NACMCF verification principle is</textblock>
    <textblock>being properly addressed, both for individual firms and for the</textblock>
    <textblock>overall HACCP program.</textblock>
    <textblock>For individual firms, NACMCF specifically discourages the sole reliance on end-product sampling for verification purposes</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 34, p. 201). FDA also has questions concerning the</textblock>
    <textblock>efficacy of end-product sampling as the only way to measure the</textblock>
    <textblock>success of HACCP. These caveats notwithstanding, FDA invites</textblock>
    <textblock>comment on what tests should be used to measure success, both in</textblock>
    <textblock>terms of individual firms and the program as a whole, and how</textblock>
    <textblock>frequently such tests should be administered.</textblock>
    <textblock>VIII. Other Approaches to HACCP</textblock>
    <textblock>This preamble has described in great detail the HACCP system</textblock>
    <textblock>that is being proposed and the reasoning behind each proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>provision. While the agency is inviting comment on the merits of</textblock>
    <textblock>each provision, FDA also invites comment on the overall system,</textblock>
    <textblock>including whether some other approach to HACCP or some variation</textblock>
    <textblock>of the proposed approach might be preferable. Variations on the</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed approach include, but are not limited to: (1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Requiring HACCP only for higher risk seafood products; (2)</textblock>
    <textblock>exempting small firms from HACCP requirements; (3) staggering the</textblock>
    <textblock>effective date for implementation based on size of firm or risk;</textblock>
    <textblock>and (4) deleting or altering some of the requirements in this</textblock>
    <textblock>proposal in order to facilitate implementation and lower costs.</textblock>
    <textblock>A brief discussion of each of these variations follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Higher Risk Only</textblock>
    <textblock>An alternative to requiring HACCP for all commercial seafood</textblock>
    <textblock>products would be to require it for products or processes that</textblock>
    <textblock>have been linked to significant numbers reported seafood-borne</textblock>
    <textblock>illnesses. As section II.B. of this document explains in detail,</textblock>
    <textblock>many of the reported illnesses from seafood involve raw molluscan</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish and certain species of finfish that can accumulate</textblock>
    <textblock>scombrotoxin and ciguatoxin. Other seafood products cause</textblock>
    <textblock>illness but are not as commonly reported. FDA invites comment on</textblock>
    <textblock>whether this proposed regulation should apply only to molluscan</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish and the species responsible for scombrotoxin and</textblock>
    <textblock>ciguatoxin poisonings.</textblock>
    <textblock>A variation on this approach would be to have the proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>regulation apply to those species and processes with a higher</textblock>
    <textblock>potential for harm, even if actual illnesses from them cannot be</textblock>
    <textblock>documented from the foodborne illness reporting system. As</textblock>
    <textblock>described earlier in the preamble, the fact that the system is</textblock>
    <textblock>not recording illnesses from a particular food does not mean that</textblock>
    <textblock>illnesses are not occurring. Also, potential for harm need not</textblock>
    <textblock>always be measured in terms of the number of illnesses that are</textblock>
    <textblock>actually occurring. For example, some problems, like botulism,</textblock>
    <textblock>may occur infrequently, but when they do, the consequences can be</textblock>
    <textblock>devastating. Based on the potential for harm, other candidates</textblock>
    <textblock>for inclusion would be: (1) Hot-process smoked and hot-process</textblock>
    <textblock>smoke-flavored fish, cold-process smoked and cold-process smoke-</textblock>
    <textblock>flavored fish, because of the hazards of botulism and listeria;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) cooked, ready-to-eat products, because of the</textblock>
    <textblock>microbiological hazards associated with products that are not</textblock>
    <textblock>intended to be cooked by the consumer; (3) low acid canned</textblock>
    <textblock>foods, because of the hazard of botulism and general complexity</textblock>
    <textblock>of the processing operation; (4) raw, ready-to-eat products,</textblock>
    <textblock>because of the risk of parasites; and (5) species that require a</textblock>
    <textblock>judgment as to appropriate location of harvest to avoid unsafe</textblock>
    <textblock>pesticide or industrial contaminant levels.</textblock>
