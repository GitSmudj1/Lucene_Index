    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, TIAS 8249, hereinafter referred to as CITES, is an international treaty designed to control and regulate international trade in certain animal and plant species which are or may become threatened with extinction, and are listed in Appendices to the Convention (and are available from the Office of Management Authority at the address, above). Currently, 120 countries, including the United States, are CITES Parties. CITES calls for biennial meetings of the Conference of the Parties (COP) which review its implementation, make provisions enabling the CITES Secretariat in Switzerland to carry out its functions, consider amendments to the list of species in Appendices I and II, consider reports presented by the Secretariat, and make recommendations for the improved effectiveness of the Convention.</textblock>
