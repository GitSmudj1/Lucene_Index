    <textblock>(2) Developing generic plans by FDA that list critical</textblock>
    <textblock>control points and contain other information for various industry</textblock>
    <textblock>segments.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Deleting some or all of the proposed specific</textblock>
    <textblock>sanitation requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Requiring HACCP only for the domestic industry. The</textblock>
    <textblock>HACCP requirements would become the basis for negotiating</textblock>
    <textblock>agreements with other countries relating to the equivalency of</textblock>
    <textblock>regulatory programs.</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Deleting or modifying the proposed training</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>(6) Requiring HACCP for processing hazards only. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Canadian HACCP system does not involve species-related safety</textblock>
    <textblock>hazards.</textblock>
    <textblock>(7) Exempting warehouses.</textblock>
    <textblock>(8) Although only in guidelines (Appendix B, Scombroid</textblock>
    <textblock>Toxin-Forming Species), sanctioning the receipt by a processor</textblock>
    <textblock>from a harvester of an assurance of good handling practices,</textblock>
    <textblock>rather than detailed time/temperature records. Such an</textblock>
    <textblock>assurance, without further verification, would be acceptable only</textblock>
    <textblock>from harvesters with histories of delivering acceptable products.</textblock>
    <textblock>These four alternative approaches to implementing these</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Comments are</textblock>
    <textblock>invited on them in combination as well as on them individually.</textblock>
    <textblock>E. Information and Consumer Awareness</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition to requesting comment on alternative approaches</textblock>
    <textblock>to HACCP, FDA is taking the opportunity to invite comment on the</textblock>
    <textblock>general subject of complementary risk reduction activities,</textblock>
    <textblock>primarily directed toward postprocessing handling. Elsewhere in</textblock>
    <textblock>this document, FDA invited comment on the advisability of</textblock>
    <textblock>applying HACCP or alternative regulatory approaches to commercial</textblock>
    <textblock>entities that are not directly subject to these proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations, i.e., harvesting vessels, common carriers, and</textblock>
    <textblock>retail establishments (although not necessarily doing so as part</textblock>
    <textblock>of this rulemaking). In addition, FDA seeks comment on</textblock>
    <textblock>appropriate education and information that should be directed</textblock>
    <textblock>toward consumers and recreational fishermen. The commercial</textblock>
    <textblock>application of HACCP principles can mitigate somewhat the effects</textblock>
    <textblock>of poor consumer handling practices by helping to ensure that a</textblock>
    <textblock>safe product reaches the home, but no such program can prevent</textblock>
    <textblock>illnesses caused by improper home handling. Similarly, HACCP</textblock>
    <textblock>practiced by processors can have no effect on recreational</textblock>
    <textblock>fishermen who consume their own catch.</textblock>
    <textblock>Education has always been an important part of FDA's</textblock>
    <textblock>comprehensive seafood safety program, but the agency believes</textblock>
    <textblock>that more can be done. Recent FDA education projects include the</textblock>
    <textblock>initiation of a seafood hotline, which has been consulted by over</textblock>
    <textblock>26,000 individuals on a wide range of seafood safety issues since</textblock>
    <textblock>it began in October 1992. (The hotline can be reached by calling</textblock>
    <textblock>toll-free, 1-800-FDA-4010.) FDA also recently developed</textblock>
    <textblock>brochures aimed at advising certain medically compromised</textblock>
    <textblock>populations that they should not eat molluscan shellfish without</textblock>
    <textblock>adequate cooking. FDA invites comment on other types of</textblock>
    <textblock>education and information activities that might be useful,</textblock>
    <textblock>including more information that might be made available through</textblock>
    <textblock>grocery stores, pharmacies, and other establishments, through the</textblock>
    <textblock>media, and through other means, including labeling. FDA is</textblock>
    <textblock>considering the merits of labeling information for consumers of</textblock>
    <textblock>molluscan shellfish, and will address this issue in proceedings</textblock>
    <textblock>separate from these regulations. FDA notes that several states</textblock>
    <textblock>have already mandated, or are in the process of mandating, point-</textblock>
    <textblock>of-purchase information for raw molluscan shellfish.</textblock>
    <textblock>The agency also invites comment on whether FDA should</textblock>
    <textblock>consider proposing to require handling instructions for consumers</textblock>
    <textblock>on the labeling of seafood. The Department of Agriculture has</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed such requirements for meat and poultry (58 FR 58922,</textblock>
    <textblock>November 4, 1993).</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA has a longstanding program to control the levels of</textblock>
    <textblock>microorganisms of public health concern in seafood. This program</textblock>
    <textblock>includes compliance policies on such levels, including zero</textblock>
    <textblock>levels (i.e., none detectable based upon official methods) for</textblock>
    <textblock>such pathogens as</textblock>
    <textblock>Listeria monocytogenes</textblock>
    <textblock>in cooked, ready-to-eat</textblock>
    <textblock>products and</textblock>
    <textblock>Salmonella</textblock>
    <textblock>in all foods. These proposed regulations</textblock>
    <textblock>require control of microbial pathogens through HACCP principles,</textblock>
    <textblock>including specific sanitation controls. Even so, FDA recognizes</textblock>
    <textblock>that no system can reduce all risks to zero. Because all foods</textblock>
    <textblock>in the home, including seafood, are subject to mishandling and</textblock>
    <textblock>cross contamination from other sources, FDA invites comment on</textblock>
    <textblock>the general subject of handling instructions. Should FDA decide</textblock>
    <textblock>to propose handling instructions, it would do so as a regulatory</textblock>
    <textblock>proposal separate from the proposed HACCP requirements for</textblock>
    <textblock>seafood.</textblock>
    <textblock>IX. Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule contains requirements for information</textblock>
    <textblock>collections which are subject to review by the Office of</textblock>
    <textblock>Management and Budget (OMB) under the Paperwork Reduction Act of</textblock>
    <textblock>1980. The title, description, and respondent description of the</textblock>
    <textblock>information collection are shown below with an estimate of the</textblock>
    <textblock>annual reporting and recordkeeping burden. Included in the</textblock>
    <textblock>estimate is the time for reviewing instructions, searching</textblock>
    <textblock>existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,</textblock>
    <textblock>and completing and reviewing the collection of information.</textblock>

    <textblock>Procedures for the Safe Processing and Importing of</textblock>
    <textblock>Fish and Fishery Products.</textblock>
