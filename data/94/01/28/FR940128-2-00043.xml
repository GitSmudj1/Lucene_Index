    <textblock>This notice is published pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 47(a)(2) and 41 CFR 51-2-3. Its purpose is to provide interested persons an opportunity to submit comments on the possible impact of the</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed actions.</textblock>

    <textblock>nonprofit agencies employing persons who are blind or have other</textblock>

    <textblock>I certify that the following action will not have a significant</textblock>
    <textblock>impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major</textblock>
    <textblock>factors considered for this certification were:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The action will not result in any additional reporting,</textblock>
    <textblock>recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities</textblock>
    <textblock>other than the small organizations that will furnish the</textblock>
    <textblock>commodity and services to the Government.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on</textblock>
    <textblock>the current contractors for the commodity and services.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to</textblock>
    <textblock>furnish the commodity and services to the Government.</textblock>

    <textblock>proposed for addition to the Procurement List.</textblock>
