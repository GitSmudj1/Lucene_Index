    <textblock>C. The Principal Hazards</textblock>
    <textblock>The most notable seafood-related hazards involve the</textblock>
    <textblock>following:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Bacteria</textblock>
    <textblock>Because bacteria either naturally live in, or can survive</textblock>
    <textblock>in, aquatic habitats, there are a large number of pathogenic</textblock>
    <textblock>bacteria that can be found in seafood, particularly molluscan</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish. Many of these bacteria are far more harmful to</textblock>
    <textblock>specific human subpopulations, such as the elderly,</textblock>
    <textblock>immunocompromised, or persons with specific underlying diseases,</textblock>
    <textblock>than to the population as a whole. The size of these</textblock>
    <textblock>subpopulations is increasing, however. Therefore, concerns about</textblock>
    <textblock>bacterial contamination of seafood, particularly molluscan</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish, are increasing.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the United States, 4.4 percent of botulism outbreaks have</textblock>
    <textblock>been attributed to seafood. The predominant type of botulism</textblock>
    <textblock>organism in aquatic environments is the kind most readily</textblock>
    <textblock>destroyed by heat. Thus, many types of processing, if done</textblock>
    <textblock>properly, can negate the risk of botulism from seafood.</textblock>
    <textblock>Nonetheless, with the trend toward greater use of modified</textblock>
    <textblock>atmosphere and vacuum packaging (i.e., packaging that excludes</textblock>
    <textblock>oxygen) to enhance the shelf life and the desirability of</textblock>
    <textblock>refrigerated foods, traditional controls need to be enhanced</textblock>
    <textblock>because</textblock>
    <textblock>Clostridium botulinum</textblock>
    <textblock>can grow in the absence of oxygen.</textblock>
    <textblock>Other bacteria of concern include</textblock>
    <textblock>Listeria monocytogenes,</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>hazardous foodborne microorganism that is ubiquitous in nature</textblock>
    <textblock>and is commonly found in food processing environments;</textblock>
    <textblock>Salmonella,</textblock>
    <textblock>which is not a marine organism but can contaminate</textblock>
    <textblock>seafood through improper handling and sanitation practices; and</textblock>
    <textblock>Staphylococcus aureus,</textblock>
    <textblock>another pathogen associated with</textblock>
    <textblock>sanitation and handling (Ref. 8, pp. 14 and 15).</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Viruses</textblock>
    <textblock>Several viruses that are infectious to humans enter aquatic</textblock>
    <textblock>habitats through sewage. These viruses can concentrate in</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish and be present and infective even when bacterial</textblock>
    <textblock>indicators of fecal pollution are absent. Viruses probably cause</textblock>
    <textblock>the bulk of seafood-associated disease, particularly the Norwalk</textblock>
    <textblock>and Norwalk-like agents, which are linked to the consumption of</textblock>
    <textblock>contaminated raw or undercooked molluscan shellfish (Ref. 7, p.</textblock>
    <textblock>30).</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Natural Toxins</textblock>
    <textblock>Problems associated with naturally occurring toxins in fish</textblock>
    <textblock>have been recognized for centuries. Ciguatera poisoning is</textblock>
    <textblock>perhaps the most significant problem associated with a natural</textblock>
    <textblock>toxin. The toxin is produced by microscopic organisms and can be</textblock>
    <textblock>transmitted to humans through the consumption of finfish that</textblock>
    <textblock>have eaten these organisms through the food chain (Ref. 7, p.</textblock>
    <textblock>89). The larger, more predacious fish (groupers, snappers,</textblock>
    <textblock>barracuda, amberjack) and reef fish belonging to the crevally or</textblock>
    <textblock>ulua (Carangidae) family are generally more likely to contain</textblock>
    <textblock>ciguatoxin than other types of fish (Ref. 7, p. 89). Because the</textblock>
    <textblock>toxin is heat stable, cooking does not make the fish safe to eat</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 9, p. 1).</textblock>
    <textblock>On average, 70 cases of ciguatera poisoning are reported</textblock>
    <textblock>annually in the United States and its possessions and territories</textblock>
    <textblock>(Ref. 7, p. 89). Deaths are rare, and the acute symptoms of the</textblock>
    <textblock>disease are usually of short duration; however, neurological</textblock>
    <textblock>symptoms can persist for extended periods. Ciguatera is</textblock>
    <textblock>geographically localized, with the majority of illnesses reported</textblock>
    <textblock>from tropical or subtropical areas.</textblock>
    <textblock>Other toxins of public health concern include domoic acid,</textblock>
    <textblock>which was detected in seafood from the U.S. Pacific coast for the</textblock>
    <textblock>first time in the fall and winter of 1991-1992 (Ref. 10,</textblock>
    <textblock>p. 1,113); and saxitoxin, or paralytic shellfish poison, which</textblock>
    <textblock>has periodically made molluscan bivalves toxic and has recently</textblock>
    <textblock>affected Pacific Northwest crab harvests (Ref. 11).</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Parasites</textblock>
    <textblock>Parasites, such as anasakid nematodes (round worms),</textblock>
    <textblock>naturally infect certain fish and ocean mammals (Ref. 12, p.</textblock>
    <textblock>724). Human parasitic infections almost always occur from the</textblock>
    <textblock>consumption of raw (sushi, sashimi) or undercooked fish.</textblock>
    <textblock>Historically, probably no more than five cases are reported on</textblock>
    <textblock>average in the United States each year and the likelihood of</textblock>
    <textblock>occurrence is estimated to be very low (Ref. 5, p. 25). Problems</textblock>
    <textblock>with parasites are avoidable through commercial freezing of the</textblock>
    <textblock>raw fish before consumption.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Chemical Contaminants</textblock>
    <textblock>The presence of toxic chemicals in the aquatic environment</textblock>
    <textblock>creates the potential for contamination of seafood products.</textblock>
    <textblock>These chemicals include pesticides; other industrial chemicals,</textblock>
    <textblock>such as polychlorinated biphenyls; heavy metals, such as lead,</textblock>
    <textblock>cadmium, and mercury; and petroleum hydrocarbons.</textblock>
