    <textblock>4. Thermal Processing Critical Control Points</textblock>
    <textblock>a. Cooking</textblock>
    <textblock>1.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Cooking Process.</textblock>
    <textblock>The processor</textblock>
    <textblock>must be able to demonstrate to itself and to</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA that its cooking process ensures the</textblock>
    <textblock>destruction of vegetative cells of</textblock>
    <textblock>microorganisms of public health concern.</textblock>
    <textblock>This may be accomplished by having a cooking</textblock>
    <textblock>process that is at least equivalent to a</textblock>
    <textblock>process established by a process authority.</textblock>
    <textblock>To demonstrate equivalence, a processor</textblock>
    <textblock>should have on file in its Hazard Analysis</textblock>
    <textblock>Critical Control Point (HACCP) records a</textblock>
    <textblock>document that:</textblock>
    <textblock>i. Describes the results of a</textblock>
    <textblock>scientific evaluation, conducted by a process</textblock>
    <textblock>authority, of the adequacy of the cooking</textblock>
    <textblock>process; and</textblock>
    <textblock>ii. Identifies and establishes values</textblock>
    <textblock>for key aspects of the process or of the</textblock>
    <textblock>product that may affect the adequate</textblock>
    <textblock>destruction of microorganisms of public</textblock>
    <textblock>health concern. At a minimum, these values</textblock>
    <textblock>should include cooking times and</textblock>
    <textblock>temperatures.</textblock>
    <textblock>Such a document may consist of, but</textblock>
    <textblock>should not be limited to, a letter from a</textblock>
    <textblock>process authority, articles in scientific</textblock>
    <textblock>journals, or Federal, State, or local</textblock>
    <textblock>government regulations or advisories.</textblock>
    <textblock>Failure to have documentation that the</textblock>
    <textblock>cooking process will achieve its goal will</textblock>
    <textblock>violate 21 CFR 123.8 and will mean that the</textblock>
    <textblock>product produced by the processor will be</textblock>
    <textblock>produced under insanitary conditions whereby</textblock>
    <textblock>it may be rendered injurious to health.</textblock>
    <textblock>2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Cooking Equipment Design.</textblock>
    <textblock>i. The processor must be able to</textblock>
    <textblock>demonstrate to itself and to FDA that its</textblock>
    <textblock>cooking equipment can deliver the cooking</textblock>
    <textblock>process that ensures the destruction of</textblock>
    <textblock>vegetative cells of microorganisms of public</textblock>
    <textblock>health concern. One way to accomplish this</textblock>
    <textblock>is for the processor to have on file in its</textblock>
    <textblock>HACCP records a document that describes the</textblock>
    <textblock>results of a scientific evaluation, conducted</textblock>
    <textblock>by a process authority, of the design and</textblock>
    <textblock>operation of the type of equipment and the</textblock>
    <textblock>operational procedures used by the processor.</textblock>
    <textblock>The engineering specifications for the</textblock>
    <textblock>equipment used by the processor (e.g., pipe</textblock>
    <textblock>sizes, flow rates, loading configuration,</textblock>
    <textblock>and, whenever a steam process is used,</textblock>
    <textblock>venting parameters) should meet or exceed</textblock>
    <textblock>those for the equipment evaluated by the</textblock>
    <textblock>process authority. Failure to have</textblock>
    <textblock>documentation that the cooking equipment will</textblock>
    <textblock>achieve its goal will violate 21 CFR 123.8</textblock>
    <textblock>and will mean that the product produced by</textblock>
    <textblock>the processor will be produced under</textblock>
    <textblock>insanitary conditions whereby it may be</textblock>
    <textblock>rendered injurious to health.</textblock>
    <textblock>ii. Cooking equipment should be</textblock>
    <textblock>equipped with both a temperature-indicating</textblock>
    <textblock>device and temperature-recording device. The</textblock>
    <textblock>temperature-indicating device should be the</textblock>
    <textblock>reference instrument for determining</textblock>
    <textblock>conformance to the established process</textblock>
    <textblock>temperatures.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Records.</textblock>
    <textblock>Monitoring records made by the processor</textblock>
    <textblock>should record both the actual values that are</textblock>
    <textblock>occurring for those key aspects of the</textblock>
    <textblock>process identified by the process authority</textblock>
    <textblock>in section 4.a.1. of this Appendix and the</textblock>
    <textblock>actual values that are occurring for</textblock>
    <textblock>operational procedures identified by the</textblock>
    <textblock>process authority in section 4.a.2.i. of this</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix.</textblock>
