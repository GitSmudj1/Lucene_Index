    <textblock>ACTION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Issuance of an extension to a scientific research permit (P45D).</textblock>
    <textblock>On October 4, 1988 Permit 648 (P45D) was issued to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to take listed shortnose sturgeon (</textblock>
    <textblock>Acipenser brevirostrum</textblock>
    <textblock>). Notice is hereby given that on January 19, 1994, NMFS issued an extension to Permit 648, authorizing research activities to be conducted through July 1, 1994, as authorized by the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA) (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543) and the NMFS regulations governing listed fish and wildlife permits (50 CFR parts 217-222). This extension will provide the USFWS time to incorporate previous years' research into the development of a new application.</textblock>
    <textblock>Issuance of this extension, as required by the ESA, was based on a finding that such permit: (1) Was applied for in good faith; (2) will not operate to the disadvantage of the listed species which is the subject of this permit; (3) is consistent with the purposes and policies set forth in Section 2 of the ESA. This permit was also issued in accordance with and is subject to parts 217-227 of title 50 CFR, the NMFS regulations governing listed species permits.</textblock>
    <textblock>The application, permit, and supporting documentation are available for review by interested persons in the following offices by appointment:</textblock>
