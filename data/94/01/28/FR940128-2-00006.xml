    <textblock>John Beck, Office of Antidumping Duty Investigations, Import Administration, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230; telephone (202) 482-3464.</textblock>
    <textblock>Scope of Order</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of this investigation, certain stainless steel wire rods (SSWR) are products which are hot-rolled or hot-rolled annealed, and/or pickled rounds, squares, octagons, hexagons or other shapes, in coils. SSWR are made of alloy steels containing, by weight, 1.2 percent or less of carbon and 10.5 percent or more of chromium, with or without other elements. These products are only manufactured by hot-rolling, are normally sold in coiled form, and are of solid cross-section. The majority of SSWR sold in the United States is round in cross-sectional shape, annealed, and pickled. The most common size is 5.5 millimeters in diameter.</textblock>
    <textblock>The SSWR subject to this investigation is currently classifiable under subheadings 7221.00.0005, 7221.00.0015, 7221.00.0020, 7221.00.0030, 7221.00.0040, 7221.00.0045, 7221.00.0060, 7221.00.0075, 7221.00.0080 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS). Although the HTSUS subheadings are provided for convenience and customs purposes, our written description of the scope of this investigation is dispositive.</textblock>
    <textblock>Amendment of Final Determination</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with section 735 (a) and (d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (the Act), on December 29, 1993, the Department of Commerce (the Department) published its final determination that certain stainless steel wire rods from France were being sold at less than fair value (58 FR 68865).</textblock>
    <textblock>On January 5, 1994, Imphy S.A. and Ugine-Savoie (respondent) alleged that the Department made clerical errors in its final calculations. Respondent argued that the Department erroneously applied best information available (BIA) to the Metalimphy Alloys Corporation (MAC) and Ugine Stainless and Alloys (US&amp;A) (both divisions of MAC, which is a subsidiary of Imphy S.A.) further manufactured sales on the basis that the cost of further manufacturing data did not include costs associated with certain manufactured sales of MAC. Respondent contends that the further manufacturing costs were fully provided on the C-1 U.S. sales database under the field ``FURMANU'', which represented processing charges by outside subcontractors or by Techalloy as the subcontractor. Respondent further states that the Department accepted this submission, used it for the preliminary determination, made no request for further information, and appears to have agreed in the final determination that the appropriate information regarding these sales had been submitted.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department does not agree that this is a clerical error. The Department required detailed cost information for further manufacturing to be reported on the E-2 further manufacturing cost database. Respondent failed to provide this detailed cost information with respect to products further manufactured by MAC on the E-2 database, even though it indicated it had done so on page 2 of the narrative portion of its May 10, 1993, submission. Respondent reported detailed costs only for products further manufactured by Techalloy.</textblock>
    <textblock>Specifically, in its clerical error allegation, respondent indicated that the cost information for products further manufactured by MAC was included in the ``FURMANU'' field of the C-1 U.S. sales tape and that the Department used this for the preliminary determination. First, we agree that the total further manufacturing costs for MAC were included on the C-1 U.S. sales tape. However, at the final determination, we made adjustments to certain elements of the further manufacturing costs. These elements were only included on the E-2 further manufacturing database. Since respondent failed to provide on the E-2 database those cost elements for the products further manufactured by MAC, the Department could not adjust the further manufacturing costs of the MAC products. Consequently, we also could not use the costs reported on the C-1 U.S. sales tape since this tape included only total costs and not the individual costs elements that we needed to adjust.</textblock>
