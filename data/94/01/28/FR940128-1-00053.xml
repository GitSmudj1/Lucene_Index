    <textblock>FDA recognizes that all shellfish-producing States have laws</textblock>
    <textblock>that require the tagging of shellfish. This proposal is intended</textblock>
    <textblock>to support those laws, not supersede them. The proposed tagging</textblock>
    <textblock>requirement is necessary for two reasons. First, there is no</textblock>
    <textblock>assurance that untagged shellfish come from safe waters. Illegal</textblock>
    <textblock>harvesting of molluscan shellfish from contaminated or</textblock>
    <textblock>unclassified waters is known to occur (Ref. 7, p. 331). It is</textblock>
    <textblock>also known that illegally harvested shellfish find their way into</textblock>
    <textblock>commercial channels. States and FDA find untagged or improperly</textblock>
    <textblock>tagged shellfish during their inspections of shellfish processors</textblock>
    <textblock>under the cooperative program (Refs. 101 through 109). FDA</textblock>
    <textblock>frequently lacks a basis for taking action against untagged</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish (Ref. 110). Proposed §1240.60 will provide a basis.</textblock>
    <textblock>Second, State tagging requirements and sanctions are not uniform,</textblock>
    <textblock>and the sanctions provided under some State laws have little</textblock>
    <textblock>deterrent effect (Refs. 102, 103, and 109). The establishment of</textblock>
    <textblock>a Federal sanction will provide illegal harvesters with sure knowledge that if their catch enters interstate commerce and</textblock>
    <textblock>comes to the attention of FDA, it will be destroyed.</textblock>
    <textblock>If §1240.60(b) is adopted, as a practical matter, product</textblock>
    <textblock>identification will begin at the harvesting site. FDA is</textblock>
    <textblock>proposing to amend §1240.60 to require that the first handler of</textblock>
    <textblock>live molluscan shellfish, be it the licensed harvester, licensed</textblock>
    <textblock>aquaculturist, or certified shellfish shipper, affix a tag to</textblock>
    <textblock>each container of shellfish. The tag will then provide the means</textblock>
    <textblock>for processors to ensure that the shellfish that they buy is from</textblock>
    <textblock>properly classified water.</textblock>
    <textblock>Moreover, the tag will provide all information that is</textblock>
    <textblock>necessary to trace the product to its source, e.g., date of</textblock>
    <textblock>harvest, location of harvest, quantity and type of shellfish, and</textblock>
    <textblock>the harvester's name and identification number assigned by the</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish control authority. The product traceability that</textblock>
    <textblock>results will enhance epidemiological investigations in the event</textblock>
    <textblock>of shellfish-borne illness. It will also facilitate prompt</textblock>
    <textblock>remedial actions necessary to reestablish public health controls.</textblock>
    <textblock>The safety concerns about shucked molluscan shellfish are</textblock>
    <textblock>substantially the same as those discussed above for in-shell</textblock>
    <textblock>molluscan shellfish. Because shucked shellfish are packaged in a</textblock>
    <textblock>container that can be labeled, the agency is proposing to require</textblock>
    <textblock>in §1240.60(c) that for these shellfish, a label may be</textblock>
    <textblock>substituted that bears information equivalent to that found on</textblock>
    <textblock>the tag. Another reason for allowing labeling in lieu of a tag</textblock>
    <textblock>is the fact that one bag of unshucked molluscan shellfish bearing</textblock>
    <textblock>a single tag can typically be processed into more than one</textblock>
    <textblock>container of shucked molluscan shellfish.</textblock>
    <textblock>The second measure that FDA is proposing is based on its</textblock>
    <textblock>experience with the NSSP and the ISSC. FDA has tentatively</textblock>
    <textblock>concluded that the system for protecting the safety of shellfish</textblock>
    <textblock>can be significantly strengthened if the agency were to require</textblock>
    <textblock>that certain limited steps be taken as part of the processing of</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish that are intended for interstate commerce. FDA</textblock>
    <textblock>believes that these measures, like the proposed tagging</textblock>
    <textblock>requirement, will serve to strengthen the Federal-State</textblock>
    <textblock>cooperative program as well as the shellfish safety programs of</textblock>
    <textblock>each of the States and countries that participate in NSSP.</textblock>
    <textblock>Many of the pathogens in shellfish, such as the Norwalk</textblock>
    <textblock>virus, are virtually undetectable. Moreover, from a technical</textblock>
    <textblock>and practical perspective, end product testing cannot be used in</textblock>
    <textblock>the processing of shellfish to ensure that they are not</textblock>
    <textblock>contaminated with one of the myriad of possible domestic,</textblock>
    <textblock>industrial, and agricultural contaminants that have been found in</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish harvesting areas. Therefore, State classification of</textblock>
    <textblock>growing waters is a necessary first step to ensure the safety of</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish. These classifications, as detailed in NSSP, address</textblock>
    <textblock>all actual and potential pollutants in deciding whether an area</textblock>
    <textblock>is suitable for harvesting (Ref. 90, pp. c-5 and c-6).</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing in §123.28(a) that each processor of</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish have an HACCP plan that ensures that the molluscan</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish that it processes come only from areas that have been</textblock>
    <textblock>classified by a shellfish control authority as satisfactory for</textblock>
    <textblock>harvesting. As noted above, the safety of molluscan shellfish</textblock>
    <textblock>consumed raw or partly cooked is predicated on the cleanliness of</textblock>
    <textblock>the growing area waters from which they are obtained. Ensuring</textblock>
    <textblock>that shellfish come from properly classified growing areas is</textblock>
    <textblock>where shellfish safety begins.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under proposed §123.28(b), processors are to process only</textblock>
    <textblock>shellfish that originate from growing waters that have been</textblock>
    <textblock>approved for harvesting by a shellfish control authority as shown</textblock>
    <textblock>by product tags or labels with specific information that</textblock>
    <textblock>establishes that they were harvested from appropriate waters.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing this requirement under both section 361 of the</textblock>
    <textblock>PHS Act, to prevent the spread of communicable disease, and</textblock>
    <textblock>sections 402(a)(1), 402(a)(4), and 701(a) of the act to ensure</textblock>
    <textblock>that the food does not contain any added substances that may</textblock>
    <textblock>render it injurious to health and is not prepared, packed, or</textblock>
    <textblock>held under insanitary conditions whereby it may be rendered</textblock>
    <textblock>injurious to health.</textblock>
