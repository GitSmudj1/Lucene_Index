    <textblock>The agency recognizes that not all processing activities</textblock>
    <textblock>will require hand washing and sanitizing. Activities that would</textblock>
    <textblock>not require such steps include the handling of raw fish and</textblock>
    <textblock>fishery products prior to the initial washing step (i.e.,</textblock>
    <textblock>directly from the fisherman) and the handling of finished</textblock>
    <textblock>products in shipping cases. These activities are exceptions,</textblock>
    <textblock>however, to the general rule that employees must thoroughly wash</textblock>
    <textblock>and sanitize their hands after each contact with an insanitary</textblock>
    <textblock>surface. Additionally, when insanitary objects come into contact</textblock>
    <textblock>with product contact surfaces, they must be thoroughly cleaned</textblock>
    <textblock>and sanitized.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the processing of cooked products, the raw material may</textblock>
    <textblock>also serve as a reservoir of pathogenic microorganisms. For this</textblock>
    <textblock>reason, employees or equipment that handle or touch the raw</textblock>
    <textblock>material must be cleaned and sanitized before being used with</textblock>
    <textblock>cooked product or ice, or they could convey the microorganisms to</textblock>
    <textblock>these foods (Refs. 63, 64, 73, 74, 84, 87, and 88).</textblock>
    <textblock>In ยง123.10(c)(1), the agency is proposing to require that</textblock>
    <textblock>the sanitary practices of the employees, especially as they</textblock>
    <textblock>relate to hand washing, sanitizing practices, and the potential</textblock>
    <textblock>for cross contamination, be checked and recorded at least every 4</textblock>
    <textblock>hours during processing. This monitoring will ensure that</textblock>
    <textblock>employees arriving for work and returning from the midshift break</textblock>
    <textblock>have properly washed and sanitized their hands. The</textblock>
    <textblock>concentration of hand sanitizing solutions tends to be reduced</textblock>
    <textblock>over the course of a production day because of the reaction of</textblock>
    <textblock>the sanitizer with organic matter and dissipation as a gas (Ref.</textblock>
    <textblock>82). It will also cause a regular assessment of the adequacy of</textblock>
    <textblock>the normal operating procedures. Finally, recording will provide</textblock>
    <textblock>assurance that appropriate procedures are being followed.</textblock>
    <textblock>In ยง123.10(a)(8)(i), FDA is proposing to require that hand</textblock>
    <textblock>washing facilities be located in all processing areas in which</textblock>
    <textblock>washing and sanitizing is required by CGMP's so that these</textblock>
    <textblock>facilities are readily accessible to employees who work in</textblock>
    <textblock>processing areas. The agency has tentatively concluded that proper sanitization is such an important part of preventing the</textblock>
    <textblock>spread of disease as to warrant a requirement that hand washing</textblock>
    <textblock>equipment be conveniently located to facilitate their use. Where</textblock>
    <textblock>these facilities are not conveniently located, they may not be</textblock>
    <textblock>frequented by the employees.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing to require in ยง123.10(a)(8)(ii) that these</textblock>
    <textblock>facilities be equipped with hand cleaning and effective</textblock>
    <textblock>sanitizing preparations and single-service towels or suitable</textblock>
    <textblock>hand drying devices. Ordinary soap is acceptable for hand</textblock>
    <textblock>washing. Hand sanitizers need to be fast acting because of the</textblock>
    <textblock>short contact time involved. In contrast to the sanitizing of</textblock>
    <textblock>equipment, which can involve leaving a sanitizing spray on the</textblock>
    <textblock>equipment for extended periods of time, hand sanitizing usually</textblock>
    <textblock>involves a quick dip in and out of the sanitizer. Of the</textblock>
    <textblock>sanitizers described previously (see discussion of proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง123.10(a)(4)), quaternary ammonium is not fast acting and is</textblock>
    <textblock>not suitable as a hand sanitizer. The others are appropriate as</textblock>
    <textblock>hand sanitizers.</textblock>
