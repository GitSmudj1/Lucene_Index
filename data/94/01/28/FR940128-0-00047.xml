    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission, at the request of Quincy Community Radio, allots Channel 240C3 at Quincy, Washington, as its second local FM transmission service. See 58 FR 46605, September 2, 1993. Channel 240C3 can be allotted to Quincy in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements with a site restriction of 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) northeast to avoid a short-spacing to Station KLTX, Channel 239C, Seattle, Washington. The coordinates for Channel 240C3 at Quincy are North Latitude 47-15-13 and West Longitude 119-48-58. Since Quincy is located within 320 kilometers (200 miles) of the U.S.-Canadian border, concurrence by the Canadian government has been obtained. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.</textblock>
