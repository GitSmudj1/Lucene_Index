    <textblock>We have since made clear, in</textblock>
    <textblock>Finkelstein,</textblock>
    <textblock>that that retention of jurisdiction, that failure to terminate the case, was error: Under section 405(g), ``each final decision of the Secretary [is] reviewable by a</textblock>
    <textblock>separate</textblock>
    <textblock>piece of litigation,'' and a sentence-four remand order ``terminate[s] the civil action'' seeking judicial review of the Secretary's final decision. 496 U.S., at 624-625, 110 S.Ct., at 2663 (emphases added). What we adjudicated in</textblock>
    <textblock>Hudson</textblock>
    <textblock>, in other words, was a hybrid: a sentence-four remand that the District Court had improperly (but without objection) treated like a sentence-six remand.</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>We specifically noted in Melkonyan that</textblock>
    <textblock>Hudson</textblock>
    <textblock>was limited to a ``narrow class of qualifying administrative proceedings'' where ``the district court retains jurisdiction of the civil action'' pending the completion of the administrative proceedings. 501 U.S. at</textblock>
    <textblock>XXX</textblock>
    <textblock>, 111 S.Ct., at 2162. We therefore do not consider the holding of</textblock>
    <textblock>Hudson</textblock>
    <textblock>binding as to sentence-four remands that are ordered (as they should be) without retention of jurisdiction, or that are ordered with retention of jurisdiction that is challenged.</textblock>
    <textblock>4</textblock>
    <textblock>Schaefer's second argument is that a sentence-four remand order cannot be considered a ``final judgment'' for purposes of section 2412(d)(1)(B) because that provision requires the party seeking fees to submit an application ``show[ing] that [he] is a prevailing party.'' That showing, Schaefer contends, cannot be made until the proceedings on remand are complete, since a Social Security claimant does not ``prevail'' until he is awarded Social Security benefits. The premise of this argument is wrong. No holding of this Court has ever denied prevailing-party status (under section 2412(d)(1)(B)) to a plaintiff who won a remand order pursuant to sentence four of section 405(g). Dicta in</textblock>
    <textblock>Hudson</textblock>
    <textblock>stated that ``a Social Security claimant would not, as a general matter, be a prevailing party within the meaning of the EAJA merely because a court had remanded the action to the agency for further proceedings.'' 490 U.S., at 887, 109 S.Ct., at 2255. But that statement (like the holding of the case) simply failed to recognize the distinction between a sentence-four remand, which terminates the litigation with victory for the plaintiff, and a sentence-six remand, which does not. The sharp distinction between the two types of remand had not been made in the lower-court opinions in</textblock>

    <textblock>482 U.S. 755, 107 S.Ct. 2672, 96 L.Ed.2d 654 (1987), held that a plaintiff does not become a prevailing party merely by obtaining ``a favorable judicial statement of law in the course of litigation that results in</textblock>

    <textblock>,''</textblock>
    <textblock>id.</textblock>

    <textblock>the plaintiff.) And the third case cited in</textblock>

    <textblock>., 489 U.S. 782, 109 S.Ct. 1486, 103 L.Ed.2d 866 (1989), affirmatively supports the proposition that a party who wins a sentence-four remand order is a prevailing party.</textblock>
    <textblock>Garland</textblock>
    <textblock>held that status to have been obtained ``[i]f the plaintiff has succeeded on any significant issue in litigation which achieve[d] some of the benefit *␣*␣* sought in bringing suit.''</textblock>
    <textblock>Id.,</textblock>
    <textblock>at 791-792, 109 S.Ct., at 1493 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Obtaining a sentence-four judgment reversing the Secretary's denial of benefits certainly meets this description. See also</textblock>

    <textblock>The Secretary not only failed to object to the District Court's retention of jurisdiction, but affirmatively endorsed the practice as a means of accommodating the lower court cases holding that a section 405(g) plaintiff does not become a prevailing party until Social Security benefits are actually awarded.

    <textblock>, O.T. 1988, No. 616, pp. 12-13. Those precedents were highly favorable to the Government, of course, because they relieved the Secretary of liability for EAJA fees in all cases where Social Security benefits were ultimately denied. But they were also at war with the view_expressed later in the Secretary's</textblock>

    <textblock>reply brief_that a sentence-four remand order is a ``final judgment'' in the civil action.</textblock>
    <textblock>Id.</textblock>
    <textblock>, at 16. Essentially, the Secretary in</textblock>
    <textblock>Hudson</textblock>
    <textblock>wanted it both ways: He wanted us to regard retention of jurisdiction as proper for purposes of determining prevailing-party status, but as improper for purposes of awarding fees on remand.</textblock>
