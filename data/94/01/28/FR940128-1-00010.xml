    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Overview</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of these proposed regulations is to establish</textblock>
    <textblock>mandatory preventive controls to ensure the safety of seafood</textblock>
    <textblock>products sold commercially in the United States and exported</textblock>
    <textblock>abroad. These preventive controls will be based on a system</textblock>
    <textblock>known as HACCP. HACCP is a system by which food processors and</textblock>
    <textblock>importers can evaluate the kinds of hazards that could affect</textblock>
    <textblock>their products, institute controls necessary to keep these</textblock>
    <textblock>hazards from occurring, monitor the performance of these</textblock>
    <textblock>controls, and maintain records of this monitoring as a matter of</textblock>
    <textblock>routine practice.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing to require that domestic and foreign</textblock>
    <textblock>processors and importers adopt HACCP controls to prevent the</textblock>
    <textblock>occurrence of hazards that could affect the safety of these</textblock>
    <textblock>seafood products for consumers. If these regulations are</textblock>
    <textblock>adopted, FDA will review the adequacy of HACCP controls as part</textblock>
    <textblock>of its program of mandatory inspections and import examinations.</textblock>
    <textblock>Such a review will occur in addition to traditional inspection</textblock>
    <textblock>activities. FDA is also encouraging, but not proposing to</textblock>
    <textblock>require, that processors and importers adopt the same types of controls for nonsafety hazards relating to economic adulteration</textblock>
    <textblock>and quality.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing to make HACCP mandatory for the seafood</textblock>
    <textblock>industry for the following reasons:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Adoption of HACCP controls by the seafood industry,</textblock>
    <textblock>coupled with inspections by FDA based on the HACCP system, will</textblock>
    <textblock>produce a more effective and more efficient system for ensuring</textblock>
    <textblock>the safety of seafood products than currently exists. The</textblock>
    <textblock>current inspection system places too great a burden on Government</textblock>
    <textblock>inspectors to uncover problems and to take regulatory action to</textblock>
    <textblock>address those problems. HACCP places primary responsibility upon</textblock>
    <textblock>the industry to demonstrate that hazards are understood and are</textblock>
    <textblock>being prevented.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. A nationally mandated HACCP system will provide a basis</textblock>
    <textblock>for enhanced consumer confidence in the safety of seafood</textblock>
    <textblock>products. Consumers should not be afraid to eat foods, such as</textblock>
    <textblock>seafood, that are recommended as useful lower fat and lower</textblock>
    <textblock>saturated fat substitutes for higher fat meats (Ref. 1, p. 13;</textblock>
    <textblock>Ref. 2, p. 21).</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The know-how for applying HACCP to seafood is in an</textblock>
    <textblock>advanced state of development. A considerable amount of work on</textblock>
    <textblock>applying HACCP to seafood has already been done by some States,</textblock>
    <textblock>academia, and the Federal Government as well as through</textblock>
    <textblock>cooperative activities between the Federal Government and</textblock>
    <textblock>industry and through independent industry efforts.</textblock>
