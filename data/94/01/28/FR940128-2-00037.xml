    <textblock>Commissioner of Customs,</textblock>
    <textblock>Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dear Commissioner: Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on December 9, 1992; pursuant to the Bilateral Textile Agreement, effected by exchange of notes dated February 19 and 24, 1986, as amended and extended, between the Governments of the United States and the People's Republic of Bangladesh; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on February 1, 1994, entry into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products in the following categories, produced or manufactured in Bangladesh and exported during the twelve-month period beginning on February 1, 1994 and extending through January 31, 1995, in excess of the following levels of restraint:</textblock>
    <textblock>Imports charged to these category limits for the period February 1, 1994 through January 31, 1995 shall be charged against those levels of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balances. In the event the limits established for that period have been exhausted by previous entries, such goods shall be subject to the levels set forth in this directive.</textblock>
    <textblock>The limits set forth above are subject to adjustment in the future pursuant to the provisions of the current bilateral agreement between the Governments of the United States and the People's Republic of Bangladesh.</textblock>
    <textblock>In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).</textblock>
