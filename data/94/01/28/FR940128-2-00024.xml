    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of this notice is to announce the revised proposed Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) for Standard Security Label for the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile. This proposed FIPS was originally announced in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(57 FR 37948) on August 21, 1992.</textblock>
    <textblock>NIST received comments from 28 government and industry organizations in response to the first notice on the proposed FIPS for Standard Security Label for the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile. While many of the comments supported the proposed standard, other comments particularly those received from the Department of Defense, recommended changes to broaden the scope of the standard and make it compatible with other government efforts to develop secure communications processes.</textblock>
    <textblock>NIST has been working with the Department of Defense and other organizations to revise the original proposal and to develop a common standard for security labels that will meet the needs of the interested parties.</textblock>
    <textblock>NIST solicits views from the public, manufacturers, and Federal, State and local government users on this revised proposed standard prior to submission to the Secretary of Commerce for review and approval.</textblock>
    <textblock>The revised proposed standard contains two sections: (1) An announcement section, which provides information concerning the applicability, implementation, and maintenance of the standard; and (2) a specifications section which deals with the technical aspects of the standard. Only the announcement section of the standard is provided in this notice. Interested parties may obtain copies of the specifications section from the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building, room B64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975-2816.</textblock>
