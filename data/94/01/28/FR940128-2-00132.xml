    <textblock>, 113 S.Ct. 2625 (1993), concerns the time period for filing for attorney fees under the Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA). Specifically, the issue before the Court was whether the 30-day period for filing a petition for EAJA fees begins immediately upon expiration of the time for appeal of a remand order issued by a court under sentence four of section 205(g) of the Social Security Act, or after the administrative proceedings on remand are complete.</textblock>
