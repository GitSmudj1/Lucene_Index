    <textblock>Privacy Act of 1974; Altered System of Records</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice is hereby given that the Department of State proposes to alter an existing system of records, STATE-51, pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (5 U.S.C. 552a(r)) and the Office of Management and Budget Circular No. A-130, Appendix I. The Department's report was filed with the Office of Management and Budget on January 14, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>It is proposed that the current system ``Classification/Declassification Center Part-Time Employee Records'' be renamed ``Office of Freedom of Information, Privacy and Classification Review WAE Re-employed Annuitants and Contractor Records, STATE-51.'' Also proposed are revisions and/or additions to the classification, the categories of individuals and records covered by the system, authority for maintenance, routine uses, retrievability, safeguards, retention and disposal, system manager, notification procedure, record access and amendment procedures, and record source categories. These changes to the existing system description are proposed in order to reflect more accurately the Office of Freedom of Information, Privacy and Classification Review's enhanced record-keeping system and a reorganization of its activities and operations. Any persons interested in commenting on the altered system of records may do so by submitting comments in writing to Margaret P. Grafeld, Chief, Privacy, Plans and Appeals Division, Office of Freedom of Information, Privacy and Classification Review, Room 1239, Department of State, 2201 C Street, NW., Washington, DC 20520-1239. This system of records will be effective forty days from the date of publication (March 9, 1994), unless we receive comments which will result in a contrary determination. The ``Office of Freedom of Information, Privacy and Classification Review WAE Re-employed Annuitants and Contractor Records, STATE-51,'' will read as set forth below.</textblock>
