    <textblock>(5) Forty percent had discrepancies relating to storage</textblock>
    <textblock>facilities that were not clean, sanitary, or in good repair.</textblock>
    <textblock>For established participants in the NMFS program (as opposed</textblock>
    <textblock>to entrants), the percentages with discrepancies in the above</textblock>
    <textblock>areas for 1989 were: 49 percent; 47 percent; 25 percent; 49</textblock>
    <textblock>percent; and 33 percent (Ref. 35, p. 42).</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA has tentatively concluded on the basis of all of these</textblock>
    <textblock>findings that HACCP-type controls for sanitation as proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>below are needed. The sanitation measures required under</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed §123.10 are fundamental to good sanitation practices</textblock>
    <textblock>and can have a bearing on human safety. The agency recognizes,</textblock>
    <textblock>however, that depending on the conditions in a facility,</textblock>
    <textblock>additional measures may be necessary (see, e.g., part 110). FDA</textblock>
    <textblock>will expect processors to include those measures in their</textblock>
    <textblock>sanitation practices but tentatively concludes that it is not</textblock>
    <textblock>necessary to include them in the fundamental core of required</textblock>
    <textblock>steps.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA acknowledges the conclusion of the MSSP project that,</textblock>
    <textblock>for seafood at least, it is possible to include sanitation within</textblock>
    <textblock>an HACCP system without unduly overburdening that system with</textblock>
    <textblock>large numbers of critical control points. The FDA/NOAA HACCP-based seafood pilot program included critical control points for</textblock>
    <textblock>sanitation. For these regulations, however, FDA has tentatively</textblock>
    <textblock>decided to propose specific HACCP-type requirements for</textblock>
    <textblock>sanitation, rather than require that processors identify critical</textblock>
    <textblock>control points for sanitation in their HACCP plans. The proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements in §123.10 potentially relate to an entire</textblock>
    <textblock>facility, not just to a limited number of critical control</textblock>
    <textblock>points. FDA tentatively concludes that this step is necessary to</textblock>
    <textblock>fully implement section 402(a)(4) of the act and yet at the same</textblock>
    <textblock>time not overload the HACCP system. FDA invites comments on this</textblock>
    <textblock>approach.</textblock>
    <textblock>In particular, FDA invites comment on whether sanitation</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements should be enumerated as in proposed §123.10. The</textblock>
    <textblock>logical alternative would be to leave sanitation as one of the</textblock>
    <textblock>procedures that is to be identified and addressed in HACCP plans</textblock>
    <textblock>for the control of microbiological and physical hazards (see</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed §123.6(b)(1)(ii), (b)(1)(ix), and (b)(4)), but not to</textblock>
    <textblock>have specific provisions in the regulations as to how sanitation</textblock>
    <textblock>is to be achieved. Good sanitation blocks avenues for the</textblock>
    <textblock>introduction of pathogens, harmful chemicals, and physical</textblock>
    <textblock>objects and is an essential preventive control for safety. Even</textblock>
    <textblock>if a product is to be cooked by the consumer, the load of</textblock>
    <textblock>microbiological pathogens on that product when received by the</textblock>
    <textblock>consumer is still relevant to safety. FDA's prescriptive</textblock>
    <textblock>approach to sanitation in proposed §123.10 is intended to assist</textblock>
    <textblock>processors to provide the greatest protection for consumers.</textblock>
    <textblock>Nonetheless, FDA invites comment on whether an alternative</textblock>
    <textblock>approach as described above would ensure this protection at less</textblock>
    <textblock>cost.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is proposing in §123.10(a) to require that processors</textblock>
    <textblock>conduct sanitation inspections to ensure that the sanitation</textblock>
    <textblock>conditions in §123.10(a)(1) through (a)(17) are met. FDA</textblock>
    <textblock>recognizes that the nature of the operations conducted by a</textblock>
    <textblock>processor affects the hazards that may be presented by the</textblock>
    <textblock>product. Processing other than storing usually involves</textblock>
    <textblock>manipulation of exposed, i.e., unpackaged, fish and fishery</textblock>
    <textblock>products. Both the manipulation and the exposure subject the</textblock>
    <textblock>product to all the hazards that can occur from unsanitary</textblock>
    <textblock>practices. Storage, on the other hand, can subject the product</textblock>
    <textblock>to some, but nowhere near all, of the hazards associated with</textblock>
    <textblock>insanitation. Consequently, FDA is proposing to require that</textblock>
    <textblock>processors of fish and fishery products inspect for those</textblock>
    <textblock>conditions in §123.10(a)(1) through (a)(17) that are appropriate</textblock>
    <textblock>to their circumstances. FDA expects that, at a minimum, in, for</textblock>
    <textblock>example, storage facilities, such inspections will include</textblock>
    <textblock>ensuring against the presence of vermin, because this is a</textblock>
    <textblock>frequent problem in warehouses that can affect products even when</textblock>
    <textblock>they are being stored in a packaged state.</textblock>
    <textblock>In §123.10(a)(1), the agency is proposing to require that</textblock>
    <textblock>processors ensure that water that contacts the product or food-contact surfaces, or that is used in the manufacture of ice, is</textblock>
    <textblock>derived from a safe and sanitary source or is treated to render</textblock>
    <textblock>it of safe and sanitary quality. Water is used in virtually all</textblock>
    <textblock>fish and fishery product processing facilities for washing raw</textblock>
    <textblock>materials, product contact surfaces, and employees' hands. It is</textblock>
    <textblock>used to transport fish through the plant in water flumes. In</textblock>
    <textblock>addition, water is often an ingredient, as in soups and glazes.</textblock>
    <textblock>Contaminated water can serve as a vehicle for contamination of</textblock>
    <textblock>the product, both directly and indirectly (Refs. 63, 64; 65, p.</textblock>
    <textblock>49; 66, 67, and 68, pp. 1 and 2). It can also serve as a vehicle</textblock>
    <textblock>for contamination as the ice in which the product is stored.</textblock>
    <textblock>The safety and sanitary quality of water from United States</textblock>
    <textblock>and some foreign public water systems is generally ensured</textblock>
    <textblock>through public water treatment, chlorination, or monitoring and</textblock>
    <textblock>control by local health authorities. Where this assurance</textblock>
    <textblock>exists, FDA does not anticipate that processors will need to</textblock>
    <textblock>implement any additional controls.</textblock>
