    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Extension of Comment Period</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 22, 1993, EPA promulgated a proposed rule, 40 CFR 799.4450, that would require testing of five chemicals for certain chemical fate, health and environmental effects under section 4(a) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA). The chemicals and their chemical-specific docket numbers are: acetophenone, 42150A/42151A; phenol, 42150A/42152A; N,N- dimethylaniline, 42150A/42153A; ethyl acetate, 42150A/42141B; and 2,6-dimethylphenol, 42150A/42154A. EPA has received requests from the Chemical Manufacturers Association for a 30-day extension of the comment period and from the General Electric Company for a 90-day extension. EPA believes that providing an additional 30-day period to prepare written comments is reasonable, and EPA is extending the written comment period for the proposed test rule until February 22, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Corrections</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, EPA is making the following corrections in the proposed rule:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. On page 61657, in Table 1, third column (``Guideline''), third entry from the bottom (opposite ``River die-away testing'' in second column), change ``(incorporated by reference) ????'' to ``ASTM E-1279-89.''</textblock>
    <textblock>2. On page 61659, third column, first full paragraph, which is headed ``3. Substantial human exposure finding,'' in the thirteenth line of the paragraph, change ``341,516'' to ``320,914''.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. On page 61670, in ยง799.4450, second column, paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A), delete the phrase ``and 2,6-dimethylphenol.''</textblock>
