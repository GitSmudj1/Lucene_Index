    <textblock>Pursuant to section 131 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2160), notice is hereby given of a proposed ``subsequent arrangement'' under the Additional Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) Concerning Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy, as amended, and the Agreement for Cooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Switzerland Concerning Civil Uses of Atomic Energy, as amended.</textblock>
    <textblock>The subsequent arrangement would give approval, which must be obtained under the above-mentioned agreements, for the following transfer of special nuclear materials of United States origin, or of special nuclear materials produced through the use of materials of United States origin, as follows: Switzerland to the United Kingdom for the purpose of reprocessing 112 irradiated fuel assemblies containing approximately 34,701 kilograms of uranium and containing 298 kilograms of the isotope uranium-235 (enriched to approximately 0.86%), and 421 kilograms of plutonium from the Beznau nuclear power station. This subsequent arrangement is designated as RTD/EU(SD)-79.</textblock>
    <textblock>The United States has received assurance from the Government of Switzerland that the recovered uranium and plutonium will be stored in the United Kingdom, and will not be transferred from the United Kingdom, nor put to any use, without the prior consent of the United States Government.</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with section 131 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, it has been determined that this subsequent arrangement will not be inimical to the common defense and security.</textblock>
    <textblock>This subsequent arrangement will take effect no sooner than fifteen days after the date of publication of this notice and after fifteen days of continuous session of the Congress, beginning the day after the date on which the reports required by section 131(b)(1) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2160), are submitted to the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate. The two time periods referred to above shall run concurrently.</textblock>
