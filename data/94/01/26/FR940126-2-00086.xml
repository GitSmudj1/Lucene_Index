    <textblock>Notice of Final Finding of No Significant Impact and Intent to Terminate Source and Byproduct Material License.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Proposed Action</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed administrative action is to terminate a source and byproduct material license which will remove the NRC authorization for Bingham Engineering to extract leachate solution from mill tailings for purposes of clay liner testing.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Reasons for Final Finding of No Significant Impact</textblock>
    <textblock>Bingham Engineering, holder of Source Material License SUA-1556 never received, held, or transferred byproduct material. The licensee's proposed project for extraction of uranium mill tailings leachate was never performed. Therefore, there was no impact to human health or the environment as a consequence of release of radionuclides.</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with 10 CFR 51.33(e), the Director, Uranium Recovery Field Office, made the determination to issue a final finding of no significant impact in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. Concurrent with this finding, NRC will terminate Source and Byproduct Material License SUA-1556 which had authorized Bingham Engineering to receive and handle 25 kg of byproduct material.</textblock>
    <textblock>This finding, together with documents setting forth the bases for the finding, are available for public inspection and copying at the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC.</textblock>
