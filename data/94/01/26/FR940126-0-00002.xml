    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The State Directors, District Directors, County Supervisors and the Freedom of Information Officer are the only positions currently delegated authority to respond to requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). During the last several years there has been a noticeable increase in FOIA requests made to FmHA. To speed up processing these requests, it will be necessary to expand the delegation of authority to include the Administrative</textblock>
    <textblock>Officers and Administrative Program Chief for each state and two additional professional positions, Freedom of Information/Privacy Act Specialist and Management Analyst, located in the FmHA Freedom of Information/Torts Section at the National Office.</textblock>
    <textblock>Classification</textblock>
    <textblock>This action has been reviewed under USDA procedures which implement Executive Order 12886. The action is exempt from those requirements because it involves only internal Agency management. While it is USDA policy to publish for comment rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts notwithstanding the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules, this action involves only internal Agency management. Therefore, publication for comment is unnecessary.</textblock>
