    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>Action is being taken to amend Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regulations to reflect changes in the law which require certain fiduciaries of incompetent beneficiaries of veterans' benefits to report non-VA income in conjunction with required formal or informal accountings. Under current regulation, fiduciaries recognized by VA are not required to divulge non-VA income and assets that the fiduciary may be holding on behalf of incompetent VA beneficiaries. These amendments will permit implementation of the law, allow for a greater degree of protection of the income and estates of incompetent VA beneficiaries and reduce the incidence of waste, fraud and abuse of VA benefits by certain Federal fiduciaries, and court-appointed fiduciaries.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Public Law 99-576, section 505 amended 38 U.S.C. 5502(b) (formerly 38 U.S.C. 3202(b)) to permit the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to require a fiduciary to disclose, as part of the accounting process, any financial information which is available to the fiduciary concerning the non-VA income and assets of an incompetent beneficiary of VA benefits. The particular regulations to be amended deal specifically with the responsibilities of Federal fiduciaries and court-appointed fiduciaries, and the authority of the Veterans Services Officers at VA Regional Offices to request an accounting from a fiduciary. Each regulation would be amended to include the requirement that non-VA income and assets be subject to inclusion in VA requested formal or informal accountings.</textblock>
    <textblock>These changes will greatly enhance VA's ability to prevent waste, fraudulent use or abuse of the VA benefits of an incompetent beneficiary by the VA recognized fiduciary. The changes will permit VA to formalize a procedure that has only been informal and unenforceable in the past, namely the request for a total accounting of income and assets managed by a fiduciary.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>These regulatory amendments contain new information collection requirements as VA will be requiring fiduciaries to provide a type of information which we have not previously required. As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs is submitting to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) a request that it approve this information collection requirement. Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments for consideration by OMB on this proposed information collection requirement should address them to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB Room 3002, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Joseph F. Lackey.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these regulatory amendments are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analyses requirements of §§603 and 604. The reason for this certification is that the additional information fiduciaries are being asked to provide is that which they already have but have not previously provided, requiring no additional data collection. In addition, the number of fiduciaries who will be reporting additional income to comply with the proposed change is expected to be only 1% or approximately 300 of the approximately 30,000 fiduciaries who submit accountings.</textblock>
