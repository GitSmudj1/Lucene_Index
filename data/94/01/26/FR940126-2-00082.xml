    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>NARA will hold a public meeting to discuss a proposal to change procedures for ordering reproductions of archival motion picture and video recordings from the Motion Picture, Sound, and Video Branch (NNSM). The proposed procedure would allow customers to place their orders directly with a vendor reproduction lab approved for such work by NARA. The proposed procedure, which will be tested for a nine-month trial period, is intended to expedite the reproduction ordering process and to allow customers to discuss technical requirements of their reproductions with the reproduction lab.</textblock>
