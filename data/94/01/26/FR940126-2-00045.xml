    <textblock>(c) Administrative allowance.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) There is an administrative allowance limitation of two percent (2%) of total funds received by the Local Board, excluding any interest earned. This allowance is a part of the total award, not in addition to the award. The local administrative allowance is intended for use by LROs or Local Boards and not for reimbursement of the program or administrative costs that a recipient's parent organization (its State or regional offices) might incur as a result of this additional funding.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The Local Board may elect to use, for its own administrative costs, all or any portion of the 2 percent allowance. The decision on distribution of the allowance among LROs rests with the Local Board. No LRO may receive an allowance greater than 2 percent of that LROs award amount unless the LRO is providing the administrative support for the Local Board and it is approved by the National Board.</textblock>
