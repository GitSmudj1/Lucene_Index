    <textblock>ICFWRU (P497B) requests authorization to lethally take juvenile listed Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon (</textblock>

    <textblock>IDFG (P503M) requests authorization to take adult and juvenile listed Snake River spring/summer chinook salmon. IDFG proposes to enumerate and collect length information on upstream migrant adult chinook salmon in Chamberlain Creek and West Fork Chamberlain Creek. They would also conduct parr density monitoring by snorkeling, conduct redd counts, and collect biological information from carcasses. The latter activities are ongoing, and were previously covered by Permit 823. However, IDFG proposes to combine activities specific to the Chamberlain Basin into a single permit. IDFG requests authorization to conduct this research from March 1 through November 30 annually through 1997.</textblock>
