    <textblock>(vi) For private voluntary organizations, have a</textblock>
    <textblock>voluntary board.</textblock>
    <textblock>Each LRO will be responsible for certifying in writing to the Local Board that it has read and agrees to abide by the cost eligibility and reporting standards of this publication and any other requirements made by the Local Board.</textblock>
    <textblock>An LRO may</textblock>
    <textblock>not</textblock>
    <textblock>operate as a vendor for itself or other LROs except for the shared maintenance fee for food banks.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) LROs selected for funding must:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Maintain records according to the guidelines set</textblock>
    <textblock>forth in the manual. Consult the Local Board chair/staff on matters requiring interpretation or clarification prior to incurring an expense or entering into a contract. It is important to have a thorough understanding of these guidelines to avoid ineligible expenditures and consequent repayment of funds. LROs' questions can be answered by National Board staff at (703) 706-9660.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Provide services within the intent of the program. Funds are to be used to supplement and extend or initiate food and shelter services, not as a substitute for other program funds. LROs should take the most cost-effective approach in buying or leasing eligible items/services, and should limit purchases to essential items within the $300.00 limit for</textblock>
    <textblock>equipment, unless prior approval has been granted by the National Board.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Deposit funds for this program in a federally insured bank account. Proper documentation must be maintained for all expenditures under this program according to the guidelines. Agencies should ensure that selected banks will return canceled checks. LROs' expenditures and documentation will be subject to review for program compliance by the Local Board, National Board or Federal authorities. Records must be maintained for three years and any interest income must be put back into program expenditures.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) LRO Documentation of EFSP expenditures requires copies of canceled checks (both sides) and itemized vendor invoices. An acceptable invoice has the following characteristics:</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) It must be vendor originated;</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) It must have name of vendor;</textblock>
    <textblock>(C) It must have name of purchaser;</textblock>
    <textblock>(D) It must have date of purchase;</textblock>
    <textblock>(E) It must be itemized; and,</textblock>
    <textblock>(F) It must have total cost of purchase.</textblock>
    <textblock>All LROs will be required to periodically submit documentation to the National Board to ensure continued program compliance. Any LRO receiving over $100,000 in Federal funds must comply with the Single Audit Act, OMB Circular A-133.</textblock>
    <textblock>(v) In addition to the aforementioned documentation, reports to the Local Board must be submitted by their due date. Interim report/second and third check request forms will be enclosed in the LROs' first check package. When the LRO is ready to request its second/third check it must complete and sign the interim report and forward it to the Local Board for its review and approval. The reverse side (second/third check request) should be completed by the Local Board chair and mailed to the National Board. LROs must complete all portions of the final report form, return two copies to the Local Board, including one copy of documentation if requested, and retain a copy for their records.</textblock>
    <textblock>(vi) The LRO must work with the Local Board to quickly</textblock>
    <textblock>clear up any problems related to compliance exception(s) at the end of the program.</textblock>
    <textblock>(vii) The LRO shall contact the Local Board regarding technical assistance, interpretation of guidelines, and resources from other Federal programs, such as U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) surplus food.</textblock>
    <textblock>(f)</textblock>
    <textblock>Fiscal Agent/Fiscal Conduit Relationship</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) For National Board purposes, a fiscal agent/fiscal conduit is an agency that is serving as the mechanism for other agencies to benefit from EFSP funds.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The fiscal agent/fiscal conduit is the organization responsible for the receipt of funds, disbursement of funds to vendors, and documentation of funds received. The fiscal</textblock>
    <textblock>agent/fiscal conduit must meet all of the requirements of an LRO.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Local Boards may wish to use a fiscal agent/fiscal conduit when they desire to fund an agency not having an adequate accounting system or not conducting an annual audit.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Any agency benefitting from funds received by a fiscal agent/fiscal conduit must meet all of the criteria to be an LRO except the accounting system and annual audit requirements and sign the Fiscal Agent/Fiscal Conduit Relationship Certification Form.</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Fiscal agents/fiscal conduits may cut checks to vendors only. They may not cut checks to the agencies on whose behalf they are acting or to agencies/sites under their ``umbrella.'' The exception to this is when an agency is using the per diem allowance.</textblock>
    <textblock>(6) Fiscal agents will be required to submit individual interim and final reports for each agency. Fiscal conduits will file a single interim report on their awards along with a breakdown of agencies and spending with the final report.</textblock>
    <textblock>(7) Fiscal agents may not fund an LRO with an outstanding compliance exception. If a fiscal agent has an unresolved compliance exception, any other funds awarded to the fiscal agent will be held in escrow until all compliance exceptions are resolved.</textblock>
