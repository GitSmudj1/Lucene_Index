    <textblock>Polio Vaccine What you Need To Know Before Your</textblock>
    <textblock>Child Gets the Vaccine</textblock>
    <textblock>What Is Polio?</textblock>
    <textblock>Polio is a serious disease that can cause life-long paralysis</textblock>
    <textblock>(that is, victims cannot move parts of their bodies). Some polio</textblock>
    <textblock>victims cannot breathe without the help of a machine. They may</textblock>
    <textblock>even die. Your child can be protected from polio by the</textblock>
    <textblock>vaccine. Polio is very rare in our country, mostly because</textblock>
    <textblock>people are protected by polio vaccine.</textblock>
    <textblock>There are 2 kinds of polio vaccine:</textblock>
    <textblock>OPV or Oral Polio Vaccine. OPV is given by mouth as drops.</textblock>
    <textblock>Most experts recommend OPV for healthy children.</textblock>
    <textblock>IPV or Inactivated Polio Vaccine. IPV is a shot.</textblock>
    <textblock>Should Everyone Get the Polio Vaccine?</textblock>
    <textblock>Experts believe that almost all young children should get polio</textblock>
    <textblock>vaccine. To help your doctor/nurse know what is best for your</textblock>
    <textblock>child, please answer the following questions.</textblock>
    <textblock>If so, the person who never got the polio vaccine should</textblock>
    <textblock>talk to her/his doctor/nurse about getting IPV.</textblock>
    <textblock>When Should Your Child Get the Polio Vaccine?</textblock>
    <textblock>Most children should have a total of 4 polio vaccines. They</textblock>
    <textblock>should get vaccine at:</textblock>
    <textblock>2 months of age</textblock>
    <textblock>4 months of age</textblock>
    <textblock>6 to 18 months of age</textblock>
    <textblock>4 to 6 years of age</textblock>
    <textblock>These vaccines may be given at the same time as other childhood</textblock>
    <textblock>vaccines.</textblock>
    <textblock>Before travel to countries where polio still occurs, adults and</textblock>
    <textblock>children should get at least 1 more dose of either OPV (if they</textblock>
    <textblock>had OPV before) or IPV. Your doctor/nurse can tell you how many</textblock>
    <textblock>doses are needed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Are There Risks With Polio Vaccine?</textblock>
    <textblock>The polio vaccine is the best way to protect your child against</textblock>
    <textblock>this serious disease. But there are risks with any medicine,</textblock>
    <textblock>including vaccines. There is a very small chance that serious</textblock>
    <textblock>problems, even death, could occur after getting vaccines. The</textblock>
    <textblock>risk from the vaccine is much smaller than the risk from the</textblock>
    <textblock>disease.</textblock>

    <textblock>1␣</textblock>
    <textblock>1Yes</textblock>
    <textblock>1No</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Is the person getting the vaccine</textblock>
    <textblock>or anyone else in the home</textblock>
    <textblock>less able to fight infections because of:</textblock>
    <textblock>A disease such as cancer or leukemia?</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>Special cancer treatments such</textblock>
    <textblock>as x-rays or drugs?</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>Drugs such as prednisone or</textblock>
    <textblock>other steroids?</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>An inborn or inherited disease?</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>AIDS or HIV infection?</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>If the answer to any of these questions is ``yes,''</textblock>
    <textblock>your doctor/nurse will probably give IPV instead of OPV</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Is the person getting the vaccine pregnant</textblock>
    <textblock>or think she is?</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>If so, she can come back for the vaccine when she is not</textblock>
    <textblock>pregnant. If she needs to be protected against polio right</textblock>
    <textblock>away, she may get OPV or IPV</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Does the person getting the vaccine have</textblock>
    <textblock>a serious allergy to neomycin, streptomycin,</textblock>
    <textblock>or polymyxin B (antibiotics)?</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>If so, he or she can get OPV, but not IPV</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Does the person getting the vaccine have</textblock>
    <textblock>frequent close contact with anyone</textblock>
    <textblock>who never got the polio vaccine?</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
    <textblock>}</textblock>
