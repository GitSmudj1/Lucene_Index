  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>Applications are invited for research projects under the NEHRP.</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority for this program is contained in the Earthquake Hazards Reduction Act of 1977, Public Law 95-124 (42 U.S.C. 7701,</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>).</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of this program is to support research in earthquake hazards prediction to provide earth-science data and information essential to mitigate earthquake damage.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applications may be submitted by educational institutions, private firms, private foundations, individuals, and agencies of State and local governments.</textblock>
    <textblock>The NEHRP supports research related to the following general areas of interest: I. Understanding the earthquake source: Determine the physical properties and mechanical behavior of active crustal fault zones and their surroundings; and develop quantitative models of the physics of earthquake processes. II. Evaluating earthquake potential: Determine the geological and geophysical setting and characteristics of seismically active regions; determine the occurrence, distribution and source properties of earthquakes, and relate seismicity to geologic structures and tectonic processes; determine the nature and rates of crustal deformation; characterize the earthquake potential of the United States on a regional and national basis; identify active faults, define their geometry, and determine the characteristics and dates of past earthquakes; conduct research to facilitate long-term probabilistic forecasts of the likelihood of large earthquakes on active fault; conduct intensified monitoring experiments in selected regions of high seismic potential; and develop and evaluate short-and intermediate-term earthquake prediction methods. III. Predicting the effects of earthquakes: Acquire data needed for the prediction of ground shaking, ground failure, and response of engineered structures; predict strong ground shaking at local, regional and national scales; predict ground failure at local and regional scales; and evaluate earthquake risk and losses. IV. Applying and utilizing research results: Application of research results; transference of hazards and risk information and assessment methods to users.</textblock>
