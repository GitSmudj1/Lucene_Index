    <textblock>Pertussis, also called whooping cough, is caused by a germ that</textblock>
    <textblock>easily passes from person to person. It can cause serious spells</textblock>
    <textblock>of coughing and choking for several weeks. For infants, having</textblock>
    <textblock>pertussis makes it hard to eat, drink, or breathe. It can lead</textblock>
    <textblock>to pneumonia, seizures, and sometimes even to lasting brain</textblock>
    <textblock>damage.</textblock>
    <textblock>Should Everyone Get the DTP Vaccine?</textblock>
    <textblock>Experts believe that almost all young children should get DTP or</textblock>
    <textblock>DTaP (a new form of the vaccine). To help your doctor/nurse know</textblock>
    <textblock>what is best for your child, please answer these questions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Has the child getting the vaccine had DTP or DTaP in the</textblock>
    <textblock>past?</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>Yes (please answer all the questions)</textblock>
    <textblock>XXXX</textblock>
    <textblock>No (you can skip these 6 questions)</textblock>
    <textblock>Please tell your doctor/nurse if the child getting the</textblock>
    <textblock>vaccine:</textblock>
    <textblock>•Has signs of illness today.</textblock>
    <textblock>•Has ever had a seizure.</textblock>
    <textblock>•Has a parent, brother, or sister who has had seizures.</textblock>
    <textblock>If the answer is ``yes'' to any of these questions, your</textblock>
    <textblock>doctor/nurse might suggest getting DTP or DTaP, coming back for</textblock>
    <textblock>it later, not getting it at all, keeping the fever down after</textblock>
    <textblock>getting the shot, or using DT (a vaccine that protects from</textblock>
    <textblock>diphtheria and tetanus, but not from pertussis).</textblock>
    <textblock>When Should Your Child Get the DTP Vaccine?</textblock>
    <textblock>To be protected against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, most</textblock>
    <textblock>children need a total of 5 doses of vaccine. Children should get</textblock>
    <textblock>vaccine at:</textblock>
    <textblock>2 months of age</textblock>
    <textblock>4 months of age</textblock>
    <textblock>6 months of age</textblock>
    <textblock>15 to 18 months of age</textblock>
    <textblock>4 to 6 years of age</textblock>
    <textblock>A vaccine called DTaP vaccine is now available. DTaP or DTP may</textblock>
    <textblock>be used for the 4th and 5th shots.</textblock>
    <textblock>These vaccines may be given at the same time as other childhood</textblock>
    <textblock>vaccines.</textblock>
    <textblock>Every 10 years all through life, everyone needs a booster with</textblock>
    <textblock>tetanus and diphtheria vaccine (Td).</textblock>
