    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>As required by Public Law 99-660, CDC developed extensive vaccine information materials for distribution by health care providers to parents prior to administration of particular vaccines to children. In response to concerns expressed regarding the length and readability of the materials and the process for development of the materials, the law was revised by Public Law 103-183 to provide for simplification of the vaccine information materials. CDC is publishing for public comment proposed new vaccine information materials which comply with the revised law.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Title III of Public Law 99-660 (the National Childhood Vaccine Injury Act of 1986) added a new Title XXI to the Public Health Service Act. Section 2126 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300aa-26) required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to develop by rule extensive vaccine information materials for distribution by health care providers to the legal representatives of any child receiving particular vaccines (i.e., diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles, mumps, rubella, and poliomyelitis vaccines). These vaccine information materials were developed as required by section 2126 of the Public Health Service Act and were issued as a final rule on October 15, 1991 (56 FR 51798; codified at 42 CFR part 110). Since April 15, 1992, any health care provider who intends to</textblock>
    <textblock>administer one of the covered vaccines is required to provide copies of vaccine information materials that comply with the requirements of section 2126 prior to administration of these vaccines.</textblock>
    <textblock>Based on concerns expressed by providers and others concerning the length and readability of the vaccine information materials (each of the three existing vaccine information pamphlets is 10 pages long) and the lengthy development and revision process required by the rulemaking process (development of the materials took approximately three years), the Department proposed legislation to amend section 2126 to provide for simplification of the vaccine information materials. Congress in section 708 of Public Law 103-183, which was enacted on December 14, 1993, revised section 2126 to: (1) Delete the requirement for development and revision of the vaccine information materials by rulemaking; (2) simplify the information to be included in the materials; and (3) clarify that the materials must not only be provided to the parent or legal representative of a child receiving a covered vaccine, but also must be provided to any adult who receives a covered vaccine.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 2126, as amended by Public Law 103-183, requires that information contained in the materials be based on available data and information, be presented in understandable terms, and include:</textblock>
