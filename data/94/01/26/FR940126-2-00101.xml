    <textblock>Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis Vaccine (DTP): What You Need to Know Before Your Child Gets the Vaccine</textblock>
    <textblock>What Are Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis?</textblock>
    <textblock>DTP vaccine (DTP) is named for 3 diseases: Diphtheria, Tetanus, and Pertussis. Each of these diseases can lead to serious problems, even death. Your child can be protected from diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis by the vaccine. These diseases_especially pertussis_are still found in our country, mostly because some people do not get enough doses of the vaccines.</textblock>
    <textblock>Diphtheria is spread from person to person. It can cause a membrane to form in the nose, throat, or airway. Diphtheria can cause breathing problems, heart failure, or paralysis.</textblock>
    <textblock>Tetanus, also called lockjaw, is caused by a germ that enters the body through a cut or wound. Tetanus causes serious, painful spasms of all muscles, ``locking'' of the jaw so the sick person cannot open his mouth or swallow, and death.</textblock>
