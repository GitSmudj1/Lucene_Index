    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The TSCA Interagency Testing Committee (ITC), established under section 4(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), transmitted its Thirty-Third Report to the Administrator of EPA on November 29, 1993. As noted in this Report, which is included with this notice, the ITC revised the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>by removing 2 chemicals and 4 chemical groups from the</textblock>
    <textblock>List</textblock>
    <textblock>for priority consideration by the EPA Administrator for promulgation of test rules under section 4(a) of the Act. The chemicals being removed are 2,4-dinitrophenol and 3,4-dimethylphenol. The groups being removed are imidazolium and ethoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds (8 chemicals), brominated flame retardants (23 chemicals), and alkyl phosphates (20 chemicals). The Report indicates that removal of these chemicals and chemical groups from the</textblock>
    <textblock>List</textblock>
    <textblock>should be interpreted only as a reordering of priorities and not a statement that the testing recommended earlier has been completed or is not needed. Prior to removing chemicals from the</textblock>
    <textblock>List</textblock>
    <textblock>, the ITC reviewed about 80 TSCA section 8(a) reports and 850 TSCA section 8(d) studies. The ITC is sharing summaries of these reviews with appropriate EPA programs offices and other concerned Federal agencies to assist them in risk assessment and management activities.</textblock>
    <textblock>There are no additions to the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA has received the TSCA Interagency Testing Committee's Thirty-Third Report to the Administrator.</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>TSCA (Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 et seq; 15 U.S.C. 260l et seq.) authorizes the Administrator of EPA to promulgate regulations under section 4(a) requiring testing of chemicals and chemical groups in order to develop data relevant to determining the risks that such chemicals and chemical groups may present to health or the environment. Section 4(e) of TSCA established the Interagency Testing Committee to recommend chemicals and chemical groups to the Administrator of EPA for priority testing consideration. Section 4(e) directs the ITC to revise the TSCA section 4(e)</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>at least every 6 months. The most recent revisions to this</textblock>
    <textblock>List</textblock>
    <textblock>are included in the ITC's Thirty-Third Report. The Report was received by the Administrator on November 29, 1993, and is included in this Notice. The Report removes two chemicals and four chemical groups from the TSCA section 4(e)</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>These chemical substances and chemical groups were previously added to the TSCA section 8(d) Health and Safety Data Reporting Rule (40 CFR part 716) in response to the ITC testing recommendations. These substances will be considered for removal from the 8(d) rule during the next 8(d) rule ``biennial review,'' scheduled to occur during 1995. See 40 CFR 716.65(b).</textblock>

    <textblock>Thirty-Third Report Of The TSCA Interagency Testing Committee To The Administrator, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</textblock>
    <textblock>Summary:</textblock>
    <textblock>This is the 33rd Report of the TSCA Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) to the Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The ITC is revising its</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>by removing two chemicals and four chemical groups. The chemicals being removed are 2,4-dinitrophenol and 3,4-dimethylphenol. The groups being removed are imidazolium and ethoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds, brominated flame retardants, and alkyl phosphates. These revisions are based on current priorities of ITC Member agencies and a review of production and exposure reports and health and safety studies submitted by manufacturers, processors, and distributors for these chemicals and chemical groups.</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The TSCA Interagency Testing Committee (ITC) was established by subsection 4(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) ``to make recommendations to the Administrator respecting the chemical substances and mixtures to which the Administrator should give priority consideration for the promulgation of a rule for testing under subsection 4(a)... At least every 6 months..., the Committee shall make such revisions in the</textblock>
    <textblock>List</textblock>
    <textblock>as it determines to be necessary and to transmit them to the Administrator together with the Committee's reasons for the revisions'' (Public Law 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 et seq., 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.). Since its creation in 1976, the ITC has submitted 32 semi-annual Reports to the EPA Administrator transmitting the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>and its revisions. These Reports have been published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>and are available from the ITC. The ITC meets monthly and produces its revisions with the help of staff and technical contract support provided by EPA. ITC membership and support personnel are listed at the end of this Report.</textblock>
    <textblock>Following receipt of the ITC's Report, the EPA's Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics may promulgate TSCA subsection 8(a) and 8(d) rules that require manufacturers, processors, and/or distributors of chemicals on the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>to submit production and exposure data (8a), and health and safety studies (8d), within 2 months of the rules' effective dates. The submissions are indexed and maintained by EPA. The ITC reviews the 8(a) and 8(d) information and other available data on chemicals and chemical groups to determine if revisions to the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>are necessary. Revisions include changing a recommendation to a designation for action by the Administrator within 12 months, modifying the recommended testing, or removing the chemical or group from the</textblock>
    <textblock>List</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>The substituted phenols were recommended for testing in 1990 and the chemical groups were added to the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>following the Committee's 1986 sixth scoring exercise (Ref. 1). The sixth scoring exercise was a systematic, computerized chemical selection procedure for identifying chemicals of concern, further defined by chemical substructural features (Ref. 5).</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Revisions to the TSCA Section 4(e) Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>The ITC removes the following chemicals and chemical groups from the TSCA Section 4(e)</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>(Table 1).</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Rationale for the revisions</textblock>
    <textblock>A. ITC's Activities During this Reporting Period</textblock>
    <textblock>During the 6 months covered by this Report, May through October 1993, the ITC reviewed the 8(a) and 8(d) submissions and other available data for chemicals and chemical groups recommended in its 22nd, 23rd, 25th, 26th, and 27th Reports. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>citations for the 8(a) and 8(d) rules and the number of 8(d) studies reviewed by the ITC for each chemical or chemical group are summarized in the following Table 2. Approximately 80 TSCA 8(a) reports were reviewed by the ITC; but the exact number is not reported for each chemical or group to protect TSCA Confidential Business Information.</textblock>
    <textblock>Also during this reporting period, the ITC reevaluated the priority for testing these chemicals and chemical groups at the urging of EPA in view of current EPA and Member agency priorities. The ITC has determined that the chemicals and groups listed in its recent Reports are of higher priority than some of the chemicals recommended in earlier Reports and is reordering priorities to reflect this determination. For the chemicals removed from the</textblock>
    <textblock>List</textblock>
    <textblock>, the ITC will forward to the appropriate EPA program office(s), or other Federal Government organizations, its review of 8(d) studies and other relevant information to assist them in risk assessment and management activities, regulatory actions, or for renomination to the TSCA section 4(e)</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>. The ITC will also include these TSCA 8(d) summary reports in the public docket supporting this ITC Report. In those cases in which the testing recommendations originally made by the ITC have not been met, the ITC encourages manufacturers, processors, and distributors of the removed chemicals to conduct voluntary testing programs to provide the recommended test data.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Specific Rationales</textblock>
    <textblock>1.</textblock>
    <textblock>2,4-Dinitrophenol and 3,4-Dimethylphenol.</textblock>
    <textblock>These substituted phenols were nominated to the ITC by EPA in June 1990 and added to the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>in November 1990. Chemical fate, health effects and ecological effects testing were recommended as described in the ITC's 27th Report to the EPA Administrator (56 FR 9534, March 6, 1991). The rationale for recommending health effects testing of these chemicals was to provide needed test data to increase the confidence for EPA's Reference Concentrations (RfC) and Reference Doses (RfD). The rationale for recommending chemical fate and ecological effects testing was to provide data that could be used by EPA to assess ecological risk.</textblock>
    <textblock>Based on a review of 8(d) studies for these chemicals, the recommended testing has not been conducted. However, the ITC decided that these testing recommendations are currently of relatively lower priority than others and removes these chemicals from the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Imidazolium and ethoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds.</textblock>
    <textblock>Imidazolium and ethoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds were recommended for health effects, chemical fate and ecological effects testing in the ITC's 22nd Report (53 FR 18196, May 20, 1988). The major concerns were for long-term dermal consumer exposure, toxicity to aquatic organisms and persistence in aquatic environments. For this 33rd Report, the ITC reviewed toxicity and exposure data summarized in the 22nd Report, data submitted to EPA under TSCA sections 8(a) and 8(d) and reports from the Chemical Specialties Manufacturing Association (CSMA) describing structures, testing and uses of imidazolium and ethoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds in fabric softeners, and studies on health effects, chemical fate and ecological effects (Ref. 2, 3, and 4). After reviewing all these studies, the ITC concludes that there is no additional suspicion of health hazard or human exposure for these quaternary ammonium compounds and that potential effects to aquatic organisms are likely to be mitigated by the binding of these quaternary ammonium compounds to particulate organic carbon. For these reasons, the ITC believes that the previously recommended testing is not of sufficiently high priority at this time. The imidazolium and ethoxylated quaternary ammonium compounds are, therefore, being removed from the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>. If, in the future, sufficient concerns arise regarding the health or ecological effects of these compounds, individual members of this group may be designated for testing.</textblock>
    <textblock>3.</textblock>
    <textblock>Brominated Flame Retardants.</textblock>
    <textblock>Two groups of brominated flame retardants were added to the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>in November 1989 and May 1990. Chronic health and ecological effects and physical/chemical properties and persistence testing were recommended for a group of seven brominated flame retardants in the ITC's 25th Report (54 FR 51114, December 12, 1989). Physical/chemical properties and persistence testing were recommended for a group of 16 brominated flame retardants in the ITC's 26th Report (55 FR 23050, June 5, 1990). Based on review of TSCA section 8(a) and 8(d) submissions, available production data and EPA's testing priorities, the ITC removes the brominated flame retardants from the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>. The most recent, available production data reviewed by the ITC were submitted to EPA in response to the 1990 TSCA Inventory Update Rule (55 FR 39586, September 27, 1990) and the 8(a) rules.</textblock>
    <textblock>Fifteen of the brominated flame retardants are being removed from the</textblock>
    <textblock>List</textblock>
    <textblock>because they are not known to be domestically produced or imported in substantial quantities. These include 3 from the 25th Report: ethylene bis(tetrabromophthalimide) (32588-76-4); ethylene bis(5,6-dibromonorbornane-2,3-dicarboximide) (41291-34-3) and ethylene bis(pentabromophenoxide) (61262-53-1) and 12 from the 26th Report: 3,4</textblock>
    <textblock>,5-tribromo- salicylanilide (87-10-5); 2,3,4,5,6-pentabromotoluene (87-83-2); 1,2,3,4,5-pentabromo-6- chlorocyclohexane (87-84-3); 2,3-dibromopropanol (96-13-9); 2,4-dibromophenol (615-58-7); ethoxylated tetrabromobisphenol A (4162-45-2); tetrabromobisphenol A bis(allyl ether) (25327-89-3); tetrabromodichlorocyclohexane (30554-72-4); tribromotrichlorocyclohexane (30554-73-5); tribromoneopentyl alcohol (36483-57-5); tetrabromobisphenol A diacrylate (55205-38-4) and C</textblock>
    <textblock>10-18</textblock>
    <textblock>bromochloroalkanes (68955-41-9).</textblock>
    <textblock>Tribrominated polystyrene (57137-10-7) from the 25th Report; 2,4-(or 2,6)- dibromophenol homopolymer (69882-11-7); and brominated polystyrene (88497-56-7) from the 26th Report are being removed from the</textblock>
    <textblock>List</textblock>
    <textblock>because they are polymers with a lower probability of absorption into biological tissues than nonpolymeric organic chemicals.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dibromoneopentyl glycol (3296-90-0) from the 25th Report as well as bromochloromethane (74-97-5) and vinyl bromide (593-60-2) from the 26th Report are being removed from the</textblock>
    <textblock>List</textblock>
    <textblock>because their health effects are reasonably well characterized and their occupational and environmental exposures can be estimated.</textblock>
    <textblock>2,4,6-Tribromophenol (118-79-6) and tetrabromophthalic anhydride (632-79-1) from the 25th Report are being removed from the</textblock>
    <textblock>List</textblock>
    <textblock>at this time to give adequate priority to recently identified testing needs for other chemicals.</textblock>
    <textblock>The ITC has prepared a report summarizing its review of the TSCA 8(d) studies for transmittal to the EPA's Existing Chemical Program and other appropriate Federal Government organizations for possible risk assessment and management activities, regulatory actions, or for renomination to the TSCA section 4(e)</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>. This TSCA 8(d) summary report is included in the public docket supporting this ITC Report.</textblock>
    <textblock>4.</textblock>
    <textblock>Alkyl phosphates</textblock>
    <textblock>. Twenty alkyl phosphates were added to the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>in May 1990. Physical/chemical properties and persistence testing were recommended in the ITC's 26th Report to the Administrator (55 FR 23050, June 5, 1990).</textblock>
    <textblock>The following 13 alkyl phosphates are being removed from the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>because they are not known to be domestically produced or imported in substantial quantities: dibutyl phosphate (107-66-4), triisobutyl phosphate (126-71-6), monomethyl phosphate (812-00-0), mono(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (1070-03-7), monobutyl phosphate (1623-15-0), mono(isopropyl) phosphate (1623-24-1), monooctadecyl phosphate (2958-09-0), monohexyl phosphate (3900-04-7), monooctyl phosphate (3991-73-9), di-</textblock>
    <textblock>n-</textblock>
    <textblock>dodecyl phosphate (7057-92-3), 2-(2-butoxy)ethanol phosphate (7332-46-9), dodecyl phosphate (12751-23-4) and diisooctyl phosphate (27215-10-7).</textblock>
    <textblock>Testing to provide physical/chemical properties and persistence data for tributyl phosphate (126-73-8) is being conducted under TSCA section 4 (54 FR, 33400, August 14, 1989). The remaining 6 alkyl phosphates have substantial production volumes: triethyl phosphate (78-40-0), tris(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (78-42-2), tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (78-51-3), di(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate (298-07-7), ethyl dichlorophosphate (1498-51-7) and 2-ethylhexyl phosphate (12645-31-7). The ITC is removing them from the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>because they are not of sufficiently high priority at this time.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dibutyl phosphate, which the ITC is removing from the</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority Testing List</textblock>
    <textblock>because it is not substantially produced in the U.S., is currently being tested as part of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Screening Information Data Set (SIDS) program. The six ``substantially-produced'' alkyl phosphates being removed from the</textblock>
    <textblock>List</textblock>
    <textblock>at this time are on OECD's High Production Volume list of chemicals and may be subject to SIDS testing in the future. Therefore, the ITC has forwarded a report summarizing its information on the alkyl phosphates to the U.S. representative to the OECD SIDS program. The ITC has prepared a report summarizing its review of the TSCA 8(d) studies to send to the EPA's Existing Chemical Program and other appropriate Federal Government organizations for possible risk assessment and risk management activities, regulatory actions, or for renomination to the TSCA section 4(e)</textblock>
