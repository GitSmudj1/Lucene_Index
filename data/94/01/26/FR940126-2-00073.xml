    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>Public Law 102-575 Section 202(a)(3) and 303(b)(3)(a) directs the Central Utah Water Conservancy District (CUWCD) to conduct, within two years from the date of enactment of this Act, a feasibility study with public involvement, of efficiency improvements in the management, delivery and treatment of water in Wasatch County; and to construct a Daniel Replacement pipeline from the Jordanelle Reservoir to the existing Daniel Irrigation Company water regulating facilities for the purpose of providing a permanent replacement of water in an amount equal to the water being diverted from the Strawberry watershed (Colorado River Basin) to the Daniels Creek irrigation area. This replacement would allow the water currently being diverted from streams tributary to Strawberry Reservoir to flow unrestricted into the reservoir, resulting in improvement to the fishery resources. This improvement is a segment of the aquatic mitigation plan for the Bonneville Unit of the Central Utah Project.</textblock>
    <textblock>CUWCD will serve as the joint lead agency with the Secretary of the Interior for preparation of the Daniel Replacement/Wasatch County Water Efficiency Project EIS pursuant to Section 102(2)(c) of the NEPA of 1969 as amended and the Central Utah Project Completion Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>A Federal Register notice 57 FR 62576 issued on December 31, 1992, announced the CUWCD's intent to prepare an EIS. The purpose of this notice is to invite the public's participation in the EIS scoping process. The purpose of scoping is to solicit public input on the scope and content of the Daniel Replacement/Wasatch County Water Efficiency Project EIS.</textblock>
    <textblock>The EIS for the Daniel Replacement/Wasatch County Water Efficiency Project will be prepared in two sections. One section will evaluate the environmental impact of the Daniel Replacement Project and alternatives for providing greater water efficiency and certain environmental improvements in Wasatch County, Utah. Preliminary alternatives to be included in this section of the EIS are: Daniel Replacement Project using only a pipeline to transport the water; Daniel Replacement Project using a combination of pipeline and enlarging existing canals; Daniel Replacement Project in combination with efficiency projects (i.e. conversion of flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation) using only pipelines to convey the water; Daniel Replacement Project in combination with efficiency projects (i.e. conversion of flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation) with maximum use of existing canals to transport the water; and Daniel Replacement Project in combination with efficiency projects (i.e. conversion of flood irrigation to sprinkler irrigation) and use of River Ditch, Wasatch Canal and enlarged Timpanogos Canal to transport the water. The EIS will also evaluate the impact of the No-Action alternative.</textblock>
    <textblock>Type of potential issues include impacts to wetlands and downstream water users associated with the conversion from flood to sprinkler irrigation; impacts associated with flow reduction in upper Daniels Creek; impacts on threatened and endangered species; and, the impact of restoring the natural flow to several streams in the upper Strawberry River basin.</textblock>
    <textblock>The second section of the EIS will cover the Provo River Restoration Prject (PRRP). The principal objective of the PRRP is to return the Provo River between Jordanelle Dam and Deer Creek Reservoir to a naturally functional state, wherein long-term dynamic equilibrium and stability would be self-sustaining. Three alternatives for the PRRP will be analyzed in the EIS. They are: no action, which would consist of making only those improvements (i.e. fisherman access to the river and installation of in-channel fish habitat enhancement structures) covered by the 1987 Final Supplement to the Municipal &amp; Industrial System Bonneville Unit EIS; existing channel enhancement, which would consist of transforming the channel into a step-pool system to the extent possible within the existing flood easements; and maximum practical restoration which would involve reconstructing essentially the entire river channel as a meandering riffle-pool system which may extend well beyond the present diked and flood easement area.</textblock>
    <textblock>Type of potential issues include impacts to wetlands and riparian vegetation; and impact of increased recreational use along the Provo River corridor on ranching operations.</textblock>

    <textblock>DATES:</textblock>
    <textblock>The scoping meetings which will begin at 7 p.m. will be held: March 1, 1994 at the Utah Department of Natural Resources auditorium, 1636 West North Temple, Salt Lake City, Utah; and March 2, 1994 at the Wasatch County High School, 64 East 600 South, Heber, Utah. The CUWCD seeks participation in the scoping process from interested members of the public, including potentially affected landowners, public officials, agency representatives, special interest groups and interested individuals. CUWCD will make every effort to make these meetings accessible to disabled attendees. Please contact CUWCD at 801-226-7171 with any special needs or requests at least three days prior to the meeting. For those who are unable to attend the meetings, written input on the issues or alternatives which should be included in the EIS should be received no later than April 4, 1994.</textblock>
