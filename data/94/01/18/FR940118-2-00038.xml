    <textblock>(1) Revisions to the reporting of securities in the following Call Report schedules to reflect the effect of Financial Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 115, ``Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities'' (FASB 115), which banks must adopt for Call Report purposes for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 1993:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) In the body of Schedule RC-B, ``Securities,'' the amortized cost and fair value for each type of held-to-maturity securities would be reported separately from the amortized cost and fair value for each type of available-for-sale securities. On the FFIEC 031 report forms only, the breakdown of securities (not held in trading accounts) in domestic offices by type of security would be moved from the body of Schedule RC-B to Schedule RC-H, ``Selected Balance Sheet Items for Domestic Offices.''</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) In the Memoranda section of Schedule RC-B, Memorandum items 3, ``Taxable securities issued by states and political subdivisions in the U.S.,'' and 5, ``Debt securities held for sale,'' would be deleted. A new Memorandum item would be added for the amortized cost of held-to-maturity securities sold or transferred during the calendar year-to-date.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) On Schedule RC, ``Balance Sheet,'' item 2, ``Securities,'' would be split into separate items for ``Available-for-sale securities'' and ``Held-to-maturity securities,'' while item 26.b would be recaptioned as ``Net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities.''</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) On Schedule RI, ``Income Statement,'' item 6, ``Gains (losses) on securities not held in trading accounts,'' would be split into separate items for realized gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e) On Schedule RI-A, ``Changes in Equity Capital,'' item 11 would be recaptioned as ``Change in net unrealized holding gains (losses) on available-for-sale securities.''</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) On Schedule RC-M, ``Memoranda,'' new items would be added for the amount of mutual funds (segregated into four categories) and annuities sold during the quarter by the reporting bank and by third parties with whom the bank has a contractual sales arrangement. In Schedule RI, ``Income Statement,'' a Memorandum item would be added for fee income from the sale and servicing of mutual funds and annuities.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) On Schedule RC, ``Balance Sheet,'' item 16 for ``Other borrowed money'' would be split into separate subitems for amounts with an original maturity of one year or less and for amounts with an original maturity of more than one year. In addition, a new category of liabilities, ``Trading liabilities,'' would begin to be reported on Schedule RC.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) On Schedule RC-O, ``Other Data for Deposit Insurance Assessments,'' a new item would be added for ``Benefit-Responsive `Depository Institution Investment Contracts'.''</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) On the FFIEC 031 and 032 report forms only:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Schedule RC-D would be revised to cover both trading assets and liabilities, including new items for three categories of mortgage-backed securities, trading assets in foreign offices (on the FFIEC 031 report forms), revaluation gains (broken down between domestic offices and foreign offices on the FFIEC 031) and revaluation losses on interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and other commodity and equity contracts, and liability for short positions. In addition to the banks with $1 billion or more in total assets that are currently required to complete Schedule RC-D, those banks with $2 billion or more in par/notional amount of interest rate, foreign exchange rate, and other commodity and equity contracts (and less than $1 billion in total assets) will be required to complete the schedule.</textblock>
