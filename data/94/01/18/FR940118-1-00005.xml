    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule will amend 28 CFR part 68, which contains the rules of practice and procedure for administrative hearings conducted to enforce sections 274A, 274B, and 274C of the Immigration and Nationality Act (``INA''). Sections 274A and 274B were added to the INA by the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 (``IRCA''), and were amended by title V of the Immigration Act of 1990 (``IMMACT''), which added section 274C to the INA. These amendments are necessary to bring the practices and provisions established in part 68 into conformity with the provisions of the INA. Specifically, these amendments will clarify the amount of time a party has to appeal to the United States Court of Appeals an Administrative Law Judge's order in a section 274A or a section 274C proceeding.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Sections 274A, 274B, and 274C of the INA require that hearings be held before Administrative Law Judges in cases involving allegations that a person or other entity has:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Hired, or recruited or referred for a fee, for employment in the United States an alien knowing that the alien is unauthorized to work in the United States; or has so hired or referred or recruited for a fee, any individual when the hiring person or entity fails to comply with the employment eligibility verification requirements (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(1));</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Continued to employ an alien in the United States knowing that the alien is or has become unauthorized with respect to such employment (8 U.S.C. 1324a(a)(2));</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Imposed, in the hiring, recruiting, or referring for employment of any individual, any requirement that the individual post a bond or security, pay or agree to pay any amount, or otherwise guarantee or indemnify against any potential liability under 8 U.S.C. 1324a for unlawful hiring, recruiting or referring of such individual (8 U.S.C. 1324a(g)(1));</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Engaged in unfair immigration-related employment practices (8 U.S.C. 1324b); or</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Knowingly participated in activities involving fraudulent creation or use of documents for the purposes of satisfying, or complying with, a requirement of the INA (8 U.S.C. 1324c).</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 24, 1987, the Department of Justice published an interim final rule establishing administrative practices and procedures to implement sections 274A and 274B of the INA. 52 FR 44972. After receiving comments, the Department published the final rule on November 24, 1989. 54 FR 48593. That rule governed all cases properly brought before an Administrative Law Judge that complied with the requirements of the INA. Then, on November 28, 1990, Congress enacted the Immigration Act of 1990, which amended sections 274A and 274B of the INA, and added section 274C. These amendments necessitated certain revisions to the practices and procedures established by part 68, which were set forth in an interim rule with request for comments, published October 3, 1991. 56 FR 50049. After receiving comments, the Department published the final rule on December 7, 1992. 57 FR 57669. The final rule, however, did not distinguish between the time the Administrative Law Judge ``enters'' an order and the time an order is ``issued''. This distinction is critical in clarifying the amount of time a party has to appeal an Administrative Law Judge's order in a section 274A or a section 274C proceeding to the United States Court of Appeals. Based upon experience gained by the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer in implementing the hearing procedures and the statutory language regarding the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer's review authority found at section 274A(e)(7), it is proposed that ยง68.2 paragraph (i) be revised to reflect the reference made to the definition of ``entry'' in the revised definition of ``issued'' at ยง68.2(k), and that ยง68.2 paragraph (k) be amended to account for the thirty (30) days the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer has to modify or vacate an Administrative Law Judge's order in a section 274A or 274C proceeding after the Administrative Law Judge enters the order.</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This rule is not considered to be a major rule within the meaning of section 1(b) of E.O. 12291, nor does it have federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with section 6 of E.O. 12612. The Attorney General has certified to the Office of Management and Budget that these final regulations meet the applicable standards provided in sections 2(a) and 2(b)(2) of E.O. 12778.</textblock>
