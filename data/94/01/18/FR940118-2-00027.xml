    <textblock>Take notice that on January 7, 1994, Northwest Pipeline Corporation (Northwest) tendered for filing and acceptance as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, the following tariff sheets, with a proposed effective date of February 1, 1994:</textblock>
    <textblock>Third Revised Volume No. 1</textblock>
    <textblock>Original Sheet No. 292</textblock>
    <textblock>Sheet No. 293</textblock>
    <textblock>Northwest states that the purpose of this filing is to supplement Northwest's December 30, 1993 filing in Docket No. RP94-107-000. Sheet No. 292 lists the allocation of the Account No. 191 balance to Northwest's affected customers. Sheet Nos. 292 and 293 were previously reserved together for future use. Now that Sheet No. 292 is being used to accommodate the filing discussed above, Sheet No. 293 is being filed as a separate sheet reserved for future use.</textblock>
    <textblock>Northwest states that a copy of this filing has been served upon each of Northwest's affected sales customers, all intervenors in Docket No. RS92-69, consolidated with the official service list in all dockets to which the order pertained, and upon affected state regulatory commissions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with ยง385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such protests should be filed on or before January 19, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.</textblock>
