    <textblock>Take notice that on December 13, 1993, Pacific Gas Transmission Company (PGT) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1-A, the following tariff sheets, with an effective date of November 15, 1993:</textblock>
    <textblock>Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 6</textblock>
    <textblock>Substitute Original Sheet No. 6-A</textblock>
    <textblock>Substitute Original Sheet No. 15</textblock>
    <textblock>Substitute Original Sheet No. 124</textblock>
    <textblock>PGT states that it is submitting these tariff sheets to comply with the Commission's order of November 12, 1993 in this proceeding to specify the procedures by which Pacific Gas and Electric Company may pay its Gas Supply Restructuring (GSR) Direct Bill in a lump sum payment. PGT also states that it is submitting these tariff sheets to revise the monthly amounts applicable under the extended payments schedules to reflect the change in carrying costs caused by the Commission's deferral of the effective date until November 15, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>PGT further states that copies of its filing were served on all parties to this proceeding, jurisdictional customers and interested state regulatory agencies.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure 18 CFR 385.212. All such protests should be filed on or before January 19, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.</textblock>
