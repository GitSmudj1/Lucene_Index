    <textblock>Nomination Process</textblock>

    <textblock>(5) The local government(s) and State(s) certify that no portion of a nominated rural area is already in an Empowerment Zone or Enterprise Community or in an area otherwise nominated for designation; and</textblock>

    <textblock>(8) Explains how the vision creates economic opportunity, encourages self-sufficiency and promotes sustainable community development;</textblock>
    <textblock>(9) Identifies key needs of the area and the barriers that restrict the community from achieving such goals, including a description of poverty and general distress, barriers to economic opportunity and development and barriers to human development;</textblock>

    <textblock>(3) The Federal resources being applied for or for which applications are planned.</textblock>
