    <textblock>Therefore, the Assistant Secretary proposes, in the best interests of the Federal Government, to extend the current projects for one additional year with the Federal Government bearing the cost. This proposal is consistent with the President's mandate to implement cost-effective, cost-saving initiatives. In order to make these cost extensions, the Assistant Secretary must waive the regulation at 34 CFR 75.261, which permits extensions of projects only at no cost to the Federal Government. In consideration of the foregoing, the Assistant Secretary proposes to waive 34 CFR 75.261 as applied to the DFSCA Regional Centers Program during FY 1994.</textblock>
