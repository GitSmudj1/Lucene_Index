    <textblock>Take notice that on December 16, 1993, Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Corporation (Transco) filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission a refund report pursuant to the Commission's order of November 3, 1993, which accepted a previous refund plan subject to modifications.</textblock>
    <textblock>Transco states that the report shows that on November 30, 1993, Transco refunded principal of $4,759,651.45 plus $5,774,677.11 in interest. The refunds are intended to return the difference between the volumes charged to Transco's transportation customers at an average retention factor of 6.1 percent, and the average retention factor of 4.8 percent found just and reasonable for the period from April 1984 through March 1987.</textblock>
