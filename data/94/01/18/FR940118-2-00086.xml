    <textblock>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is considering issuance of amendments to Facility Operating License Nos. NPF-4 and NPF-7 issued to the Virginia Electric and Power Company (the licensee), for operation of the North Anna Power Station, Units 1 and 2 (NA-1&amp;2) located in Louisa County, Virginia.</textblock>
    <textblock>Environmental Assessment</textblock>
    <textblock>Identification of Proposed Action</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed action would revise the limitations on concentrations of radioactive material released in liquid effluents and the limitations on the dose rate resulting from radioactive material released in gaseous effluents, and reflect the relocation of the prior 10 CFR 20.106 requirements to the new 10 CFR 20.1302. These changes are in response to the new 10 CFR part 20. The review of an additional item, to revise the definition of ``UNRESTRICTED AREA'', was not completed and consequently is not included in the amendment. It will be addressed by separate correspondence.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Need for the Proposed Action</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed action is needed in order to retain operational flexibility consistent with 10 CFR part 50, Appendix I, concurrent with the implementation of the revised 10 CFR part 20.</textblock>
    <textblock>Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed revision does not change the actual release rates as referenced in the Technical Specifications (TS) as a dose rate to the maximally exposed number of the public. Therefore, there will be no increase in the types or amounts of effluents that may be released offsite, nor an increase in individual or cumulative occupational radiation exposures. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed changes.</textblock>
    <textblock>Wih regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed changes do not affect nonradiological effluents and have no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiological impacts associated with the proposed changes.</textblock>
    <textblock>Alternatives to the Proposed Action</textblock>
    <textblock>Since the Commission's staff has concluded that there is no significant environmental impact associated with the proposed changes to the TS, any alternative to the amendments will have either no significantly different environmental impact or greater environmental impact. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendments. This would not reduce environmental impacts as a result of plant operation.</textblock>
    <textblock>Alternative Use of Resources</textblock>
    <textblock>This action does not involve the use of any resources not previously considered in connection with the Final Environmental Statement related to the operation of NA-1&amp;2, dated April 1973.</textblock>
    <textblock>Agencies and Persons Consulted</textblock>
    <textblock>The staff consulted with the State of Virginia regarding the environmental impact of the proposed action.</textblock>
    <textblock>Finding of No Significant Impact</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement for the proposed amendments.</textblock>
    <textblock>Based on the above environmental assessment, the Commission concludes that the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.</textblock>
