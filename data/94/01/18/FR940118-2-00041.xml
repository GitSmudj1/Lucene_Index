    <textblock>The drug export provisions in section 802 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 382) provide that FDA may approve applications for the export of drugs that are not currently approved in the United States.

Section 802(b)(3)(C) of the act requires that the agency review the application within 30 days of its filing to determine whether the requirements of section 802(b)(3)(B) have been satisfied. Section 802(b)(3)(A) of the act requires that the agency publish a notice in the Federal Register within 10 days of the filing of an application for export to facilitate public participation in its review of the application. To meet this requirement, the agency is providing notice that Merck Research Laboratories, Division of Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ 07065, has filed an application requesting approval for the export of the bulk animal drug substance abamectin to the Netherlands where it will be further exported to Australia or New Zealand either as the bulk material or as the formulated injectable product.
