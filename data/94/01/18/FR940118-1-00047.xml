    <textblock>The Coast Guard's efforts to encourage production and use of hybrid PFD's is based upon comments obtained from the manufacturers of hybrid PFD's during the 1991 and 1992 Underwriters Laboratories Industry Advisory Council and 1991 National Boating Safety Advisory Council. In this light, the Coast Guard proposes to change the following sections to make hybrids more appealing to boaters and to reduce the regulatory burden placed upon manufacturers:</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 160.077-1␣Scope</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Discussions at the 1991 Underwriters Laboratory Industry Advisory Conference indicated that consumers are discouraged from purchasing hybrid PFD's because the REQUIRED TO BE WORN limitation causes legal questions in the users mind and leaves little flexibility in use of the devices. Also, in May 1992 NBSAC recommended carriage of hybrid PFD's be allowed without being ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN.'' To encourage consumers to purchase_and ultimately wear_hybrid PFD's the Scope will be revised to indicate that hybrid PFD's approved as Type I, II, or III devices do not have the restriction of being REQUIRED TO BE WORN.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Under the interim final rule a hybrid PFD is approved only for adults. The Coast Guard proposed to amend this paragraph to include hybrid inflatable PFD's for small children weighing 14-23 kg (30-50 lb), and for youths weighing 23-40 kg (50-90 lb). Current regulations require hybrid PFD's with Type I and II performance to have automatic inflation mechanisms. Hybrid PFD's for use by small children weighing 14-23 kg (30-50 lb) would be approved a Type I or II only. Hybrid PFD's approved for use by youths would be aprpoved as Types I, II, III, and V. Hybrid PFD's for infants, persons weighing less than 14 kg are not proposed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 160.077-3␣Definitions</textblock>
    <textblock>(j) The USCG is proposing adoption of standards for approval of hybrid inflatable PFD's for youths, weighing 23-40 kg (50-90 lb), and small children, weighing 14-23 kg (30-50 lb). Under the proposal this paragraph will be revised to redefine ``Reference Vest'' to include models CKM-1, child medium; and model CKS-2, child small, meeting subpart 160.047 of this chapter.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 160.077-5␣Required to be Worn</textblock>
    <textblock>(c)(1) Recreational hybrid PFD's approved as Type I, II, or III will meet carriage requirements without being worn. Therefore, this paragraph will be changed to indicate that</textblock>
    <textblock>only Type V</textblock>
    <textblock>recreational hybrid PFD's are ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN.''</textblock>
    <textblock>(c)(2) Commercial hybrid PFD's approved as type I will meet carriage requirements without being worn. Therefore, this paragraph will be changed to indicate that</textblock>
    <textblock>only Type V</textblock>
    <textblock>commercial hybrid PFD's are ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN.''</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 160.077-7␣Type</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Type I, II, or III hybrid PFD's will not be bound to Type V restrictions. In keeping with the change to §160.077-1(b) and (d) this paragraph will be revised to indicate that hybrid PFD's may be approved as Types I, II, III, or V for persons in various weight ranges over 23 kg (50 lb.) and as Types I and II for persons weighing 14-23 kg (30-50 lb). Type V is not a performance Type. Type V approval means the device is limited to special uses or conditions. Type V hybrid PFD's are ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN`` because they have reduced inherent buoyancy. Type V hybrid PFD's will be required to have Type I, II, or III performance when inflated.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) The proposed change to hybrid PFD Types approved, discussed in §160.077-7(a) of this section, authorizes hybrid PFD's to be approved as Type I, II, III, or V for persons weighing over 23 kg (50 lb) and Types I and II for persons weighing 14-23 kg (30-50 lb). To be consistent with that change, this paragraph will be revised to indicate that hybrid PFD's must have at least Type I, II, or III performance.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 160.077-13␣Materials_Commercial Hybrid PFD</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Current commercial equipment regulations only require vessels in certain operations to carry PFD's with approved PFD lights. Because PFD lights are not required for all commercial vessels the requirement that commercial hybrid PFD's be provided with a light will be deleted.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 160.077-15␣Construction and Performance_Recreational Hybrid PFD</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)(13) A proposed requirement will be added to provide Type I recreational hybrid PFD's with a PFD light attachment. This requirement is intended to provide vessel operators with an option to attach a PFD light, while avoiding damage to the inflation chamber due to improper light attachment.</textblock>
