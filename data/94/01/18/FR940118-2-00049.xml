    <textblock>RailAmerica, Inc. (RailAmerica) has filed a notice of exemption to acquire control, through stock purchase, of South Central Tennessee Railroad Company (SCTR), a class III rail carrier which operates over approximately 50 miles of rail line in the vicinity 40 miles west of Nashville, TN, extending from Colesburg Yard, TN (at milepost 2.9) where it interchanges with CSX Transportation, to Hohenwald, TN (at milepost 52.1).</textblock>
    <textblock>RailAmerica, a noncarrier holding company, also controls Huron and Eastern Railway, Inc. (HESR) and Saginaw Valley Railway Company (SGVY).</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the terms of an agreement with Kyle Railways (Kyle), a shortline railroad holding company, RailAmerica will purchase 100 percent of SCTR's stock, and, after consummation, RailAmerica will be in control of three non-connecting class III rail carriers. The proposed control transaction was scheduled for consummation on or after December 31, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>RailAmerica indicates that: (1) The lines operated by SCTR do not connect with any rail lines operated by HESR or SGVY, or its corporate family; (2) the involved transaction is not a part of a series of anticipated transactions that would connect the railroads with each other or any railroad in their corporate family; and (3) the transaction does not involve a class I carrier. The transaction is therefore exempt from the prior approval requirements of 49 U.S.C. 11343. See 49 CFR 1180.2(d)(2). The purpose of the transaction is to preserve rail service on a light density rail line. RailAmerica anticipates that it will be able to attract more rail service to the line than is presently being provided by offering lower costs, more frequent service, and an increased car supply.</textblock>
    <textblock>As a condition to the use of this exemption, any employees adversely affected by the transaction will be protected by the conditions set forth in</textblock>
    <textblock>New York Dock Ry._Control_Brooklyn Eastern Dist.,</textblock>
    <textblock>360 I.C.C. 60 (1979).</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>Petitions to revoke the exemption under 49 U.S.C. 10505(d) may be filed at any time. The filing of a petition to revoke will not stay the transaction. Pleadings must be filed with the Commission and served on: Eric D. Gerst, General Counsel, 21 South Fifth Street, Suite 528, Philadelphia, PA 19106.</textblock>
    <textblock>Decided: January 11, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>By the Commission, David M. Konschnik, Director, Office of Proceedings.</textblock>
