    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This amendment adopts a new airworthiness</textblock>
    <textblock>directive (AD) that applies to Rockwell</textblock>
    <textblock>International/Air Transport Division (Collins)</textblock>
    <textblock>DME-700 distance measuring equipment (DME) installed on</textblock>
    <textblock>aircraft. This action requires modifying these DME</textblock>
    <textblock>units to ensure they are functioning properly. Several</textblock>
    <textblock>reports of the affected DME units failing to process</textblock>
    <textblock>and update distance outputs, and reports of these units</textblock>
    <textblock>establishing a continuous restart mode upon power</textblock>
    <textblock>application prompted this AD. The actions specified by</textblock>
    <textblock>this AD are intended to prevent improper operation of</textblock>
    <textblock>this equipment, which could result in navigational</textblock>
    <textblock>errors.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>A proposal to amend part 39</textblock>
    <textblock>of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD</textblock>
    <textblock>that applies to certain Collins DME-700 distance</textblock>
    <textblock>measurement equipment installed on aircraft was</textblock>
    <textblock>published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on January 25, 1993</textblock>
    <textblock>(58 FR 5949). The action proposed to require</textblock>
    <textblock>modifying these DME units to ensure that they are</textblock>
    <textblock>functioning properly. The proposed modifications would</textblock>
    <textblock>be accomplished in accordance with the following</textblock>
    <textblock>Collins service bulletins (SB) (1) SB 20, Revision 1,</textblock>
    <textblock>DME-700-34-20, dated August 30, 1991, which when</textblock>
    <textblock>incorporated prevents a condition known as ``sleeping</textblock>
    <textblock>DME's''; and (2) Collins SB 24, DME-700-34-24, dated May</textblock>
    <textblock>15, 1992; Collins SB 25, DME-700-34-25, dated November</textblock>
    <textblock>11, 1992; and Collins SB 26, DME-700-34-26, dated</textblock>
    <textblock>October 21, 1992, as applicable, which when</textblock>
    <textblock>incorporated prevent a condition known as ``deaf DME's''.</textblock>
    <textblock>Interested persons have been afforded an</textblock>
    <textblock>opportunity to participate in the making of this</textblock>
    <textblock>amendment. Based on the comments received, the</textblock>
    <textblock>proposal was changed to add a modification that went</textblock>
    <textblock>beyond the scope of that which was originally proposed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, the FAA issued a supplementary NPRM</textblock>
    <textblock>that incorporated minor revisions and added the</textblock>
    <textblock>additional modification. The proposed actions</textblock>
    <textblock>specified in the Supplemental NPRM would be</textblock>
    <textblock>accomplished in accordance with the following, as</textblock>
    <textblock>applicable:</textblock>
