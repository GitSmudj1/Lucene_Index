    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On March 11, 1993, the State of Connecticut submitted a formal revision to its State Implementation Plan (SIP). The SIP revision consists of State Order No. 7019.</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The Hamilton Standard Division of United Technologies Corporation (UTC), located at Windsor Locks, CT, operates several boilers which emit sulfur dioxide (SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>). On April 6, 1990, the Hamilton Standard Division received a notice of violation from the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (CT DEP). Dispersion modeling done by CT DEP showed potential violations of the 3-hour and 24-hour Connecticut Ambient Air Quality Standards (CAAQS) and National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>. TRC Consultants, under contract to UTC, performed a subsequent dispersion modeling study to determine which actions UTC could take to prevent these violations. In June, 1991, TRC provided a report which recommended a compliance strategy for UTC to follow. On January 7, 1993, CT DEP issued State Order No. 7019, which requires UTC to implement this compliance strategy.</textblock>
    <textblock>Summary of SIP Revision</textblock>
    <textblock>The SIP revision consists of Connecticut State Order No. 7019. The order makes certain recommendations contained in the TRC report entitled</textblock>
    <textblock>Air Quality Modeling Analysis to Demonstrate SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>CAAQS/NAAQS Compliance at the Hamilton Standard Division of United Technologies Corporation Windsor Locks, Connecticut Facility legally binding on UTC. These recommendations are based on modeling done by TRC in accordance with EPA and Connecticut DEP modeling guidance. The Modeling study used the ISCST and PTMTPA-CONN models.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under State Order No. 7019, UTC will be required to take the following actions:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Concerning the four boilers designated 518(41), 519(42), 520(43), and 521(44), not more than three (3) may be operated simultaneously.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Boilers 519(42) and 520(43) shall burn only Natural Gas or No. 6 fuel oil with sulfur content not exceeding 1.0%, and boilers 518(41) and 521(44) shall burn only No. 6 fuel oil with sulfur content not exceeding 1.0%.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Boilers 506(48) and 505(49) shall burn either natural gas or No. 4 or No. 2 fuel oil with sulfur content not exceeding 0.3%.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Test Cell D and Test Cell E shall be restricted to burning Jet-A fuel with sulfur content not exceeding 0.3%.</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) The stack heights of Boilers 518(41), 519(42), 520(43), and 521(44) shall be increased to not less than 23.4 meters.</textblock>
    <textblock>Enforcement</textblock>
    <textblock>State Order No. 7019 contains requirements that UTC keep records of the sulfur content of each purchase of fuel, and specifies the dates for the commencement and completion of the higher stacks required by the order. These records will allow the state to monitor compliance. State Order No. 7019 also contains a schedule of fines which UTC must pay if a violation occurs, as well as the name and address of the person at the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection to whom payments are to be sent.</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA has reviewed State Order No. 7019 and has determined that the restrictions in sulfur content and the increases in stack height are sufficient to maintain the NAAQS in the vicinity of UTC's facility in Windsor Locks, Connecticut.</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA is approving this SIP revision without prior proposal because the Agency views this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments. This action will be effective 60 days from the date of this</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>notice unless, by February 17, 1994, notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted. If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effective date by simultaneously publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw the final action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effective on March 21, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Final Action</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA is approving State Order No. 7019 dated March 11, 1993 and effective in the State of Connecticut on February 19, 1993. The order is supported by a modeling study which demonstrates attainment of the NAAQS.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>, EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.</textblock>
    <textblock>This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225).</textblock>
    <textblock>SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the CAA do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the Federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the Federal-state relationship under the CAA, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute Federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of state action. The CAA forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIPs on such grounds.</textblock>

    <textblock>, 427 U.S. 246, 256-66 (S.Ct. 1976); 42 U.S.C. 7410 (a)(2).</textblock>
    <textblock>On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 revisions (54 FR 2222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of two years. EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request continues in effect under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any State implementation plan. Each request for revision to the State implementation plan shall be considered separately in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by March 21, 1994. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this rule for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)</textblock>
