    <textblock>II. Background Information</textblock>
    <textblock>Toxic contaminants in bottom sediments of the nation's lakes, rivers, wetlands, and coastal waters create the potential for continued environmental impact even where water column contaminant levels comply with established water quality criteria. In addition, contaminated sediments can have impacts on water quality even when additional pollutants are no longer being added by any other source. It is intended that sediment quality criteria be protective of benthic organisms and be used to: assess the extent of sediment contamination, aid in implementing measures that limit or prevent additional contamination, and identify when appropriate remediation activities are needed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 314(a)(1)), directs EPA to develop and publish criteria reflecting the latest scientific knowledge on the identifiable effects of pollutants on public health and welfare, aquatic life, wildlife and recreation. EPA has periodically issued ambinent water quality criteria guidance, beginning with the publication of ``Water Quality Criteria 1972.'' All criteria guidance through late 1986 was summarized in an EPA document entitled ``Quality Criteria for Water, 1986.'' EPA has subsequently published, from time to time, new ambient water quality criteria guidance for additional pollutants or revised existing criteria guidance.</textblock>
