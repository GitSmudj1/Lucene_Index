    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(c), the Department of Commerce (the Department) initiated an administrative review of exports to the United States for the period June 1, 1991 through May 31, 1992 (57 FR 32521) on July 22, 1992, and for the period June 1, 1992 through May 31, 1993 (58 FR 39007) on July 21, 1993. On December 22, 1993, Magyar Gordulocsapagy Muvek (MGM) and the Timken Company, the Petitioner, jointly asked the Department to terminate these reviews, stating that both parties sought to conserve resources, and MGM withdrew its requests for reviews.</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5), ``the Secretary may permit a party that requests a review under paragraph (a) of this section to withdraw the request not later than ninety days after the date of publication of notice of initiation of the requested review. The Secretary may extend this time limit if the Secretary decides that it is reasonable to do so.''</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the circumstances in which no interested party objects to the request for termination, we believe that it is reasonable to extend the ninety-day time limit governing the withdrawal of requests for administrative reviews. Thus, in view of MGM's and Timken's request of December 22, 1993, the Department is terminating these reviews.</textblock>
    <textblock>These terminations are in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a)(5).</textblock>
