    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>In this document, the Bureau of Prisons is extending coverage under Inmate Accident Compensation to inmates participating in approved work assignments for other Federal agencies. Because inmates participating in such assignments may be housed in a community corrections center, it is necessary to add procedures appropriate for the treatment and reporting of injuries and for processing claims which may arise from such assignments. This amendment also clarifies the applicability of lost-time wages, clarifies the effects of subsequent incarceration, clarifies the definition of ``release'', clarifies payment procedures for medical treatment, and corrects a typographical error in the citation of a court case. This amendment is intended to allow for the continued efficient operation of inmate work assignments.</textblock>

    <textblock>The Bureau of Prisons published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on July 21, 1993 (58 FR 39096) a proposed rule on Inmate Accident Compensation clarifying its applicability to approved inmate work assignments for other federal agencies. The proposed amendment also clarified that lost-time wages shall be available only for inmates based at Bureau of Prisons institutions (see new §301.201) and that the amount of a payment for medical treatment is limited to reasonable expenses incurred, such as those amounts authorized under the applicable fee schedule established for the Department of Health and Human Services Medicare program (see §301.317). This amendment also revised the definition of ``release'' in §301.102 to include reference to pretrial inmates. The proposed amendment also clarified §301.316 by rewording its provisions regarding subsequent incarceration of a compensation recipient. There is no change in the intent of this section. Finally, the proposed amendment corrected a typographical error in the citation of the court case</textblock>
