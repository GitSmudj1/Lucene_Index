    <textblock>Notice of Availability and Request for Comment on Sediment Quality Criteria and Support Documents.</textblock>

  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to section 304(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed, and is requesting public comments on, documents presenting proposed Sediment Quality Criteria for the Protection of Benthic Organisms for five priority pollutant (section 307(a)) chemicals, guidelines for deriving these criteria on a site-specific basis, and the technical basis for deriving the criteria. The criteria documents present data and criteria for acenaphthene, dieldrin, endrin, fluoranthene and phenanthrene, which were selected for their known toxicity, hydrophobicity, and persistence. EPA intends to publish each of the documents in final form after considering public comments, while the general regulatory role Sediment Quality Criteria play will be outlined in the Contaminated Sediment Management Strategy (CSMS) which will be available for public comment in the near future. The Agency is specifically soliciting comments on the scientific soundness of the criteria development methodology and the criteria themselves as opposed to their application. Comments received in response to this notice on the intended uses and implementation of the criteria will be taken into account in preparing the proposed CSMS and other guidance materials. An exception to this is the potential for the Sediment Quality Criteria to be used as Applicable and Relevant or Appropriate Requirements (ARARs) under CERCLA. The EPA particularly welcomes comment and discussion on the applicability and appropriateness of using the criteria as ARARs.</textblock>
