    <textblock>(a) As provided in Subpart 25.25 of this chapter, and in 33 CFR part 175, a Type V hybrid PFD may be used to meet the Coast Guard PFD carriage requirements in those regulations only if it is used in accordance with any requirements on the approval label. Those marked ``REQUIRED TO BE WORN'' must be worn whenever the vessel is underway and the intended wearer is not within an enclosed space.</textblock>

A Type V PFD is a PFD that, unlike other PFD Types, has limitations on its approval.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) The approval tests in this subpart require each Type V hybrid PFD to have at least Type I, II, or III performance if permitted by its intended size range.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) A hybrid PFD may be approved for use on recreational boats, commercial vessels or both if the applicable requirements are met.</textblock>
