    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document reopens the comment period for Notice No. 785, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on December 14, 1993 [58 FR 65295]. In Notice No. 785, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) proposed to amend its regulations to liberalize the requirements for using a multistate appellation of origin on a wine label. The current regulations provide that a wine may bear a multistate appellation of origin only where the wine is in conformance with the laws and regulations governing the composition, method of manufacture, and designation of wines in all the States listed in the appellation. The proposed amendment would provide an exception where State laws and regulations do not authorize the use of a multistate appellation of origin which includes that State for wines sold within its boundaries.</textblock>
    <textblock>The comment period is being reopened based on requests from two wine industry associations.</textblock>

    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 14, 1993, ATF published Notice No. 785, soliciting comments from the public and industry on a proposal to amend 27 CFR 4.25a(d)(3) to make it more practical to use a multistate appellation of origin on a wine label. This proposal was based on a petition by Stimson Lane Ltd., a company with wineries located in Washington and California.</textblock>
    <textblock>ATF has received written requests from the Wine Institute and the American Vintners Association (AVA) for additional time to review and analyze the issues raised in this rulemaking proceeding. Since the Wine Institute and AVA are directly impacted by issues raised in Notice No. 785, ATF believes that reopening the comment period is justified. Therefore, the comment period is being reopened until March 21, 1994.</textblock>
