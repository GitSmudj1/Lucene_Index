    <textblock>NTIS invites representatives of federal agencies to attend an open briefing and discussion covering the procedures, definitions, roles, and benefits of a newly published regulation covering the transfer of Federal scientific, technical, and engineering information (STEI). The briefing will be held at the Department of Commerce, Herbert C. Hoover Building, room 4830, on January 26, 1994, 2 to 4 p.m.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 108 of the American Technology Preeminence Act (Pub. L. 102-245) requires all federal agencies to transfer Government-financed STEI to the National Technical Information Service (NTIS). The final rule establishing procedures to be used was published in</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(Vol. 15, No. 1, January 3, 1994, pp 6-12) as 15 CFR part 1180. The procedures become effective on February 1, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of the Act is to promote the national economic competitiveness of the United States and to help U.S. industries speed the development of new products and processes. Centralized availability of Government-sponsored STEI to industry, as well as to other users, is an important means toward this end. NTIS was created for this purpose in 1950. Until now, the transfer of federal STEI products to NTIS was voluntary.</textblock>
    <textblock>Recent policy statements have stressed the need for better dissemination of Government information, including the President's report on Technology for America's Economic Growth and the June 1993 release of OMB Circular A-130. The latter makes dissemination of information a responsibility of each Government agency. The procedures established in the new regulation can aid Federal agencies to meet their obligations under these policies as well.</textblock>
    <textblock>The meeting is open to all Federal employees, but attendance is limited to 75 persons. Persons interested in attending should contact Mr. Walter L. Finch, Associate Director for Business Development, NTIS, 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161 (telephone: 703-487-4674). Additional briefings will be scheduled if needed.</textblock>
