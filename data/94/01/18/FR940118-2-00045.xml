    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with Title 43, CFR 8340 and in conformance with principles established by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, the logging roads mentioned above are gated and closed to all motorized vehicle traffic. Careful review and analysis in cooperation with the Idaho Fish and Game Department, country governments, and the public has determined that unrestricted use of these roads by motorized vehicle traffic will significantly reduce habitat effectiveness for upland and big game in already heavily roaded areas. All road closure(s) contained herein serve to mitigate impacts resulting from salvage timber sales. Copies of maps indicating these road closures are posted at the Deep Creek and Pocatello Resource Area Offices of the Idaho Bureau of Land Management. These closures are not restricted to authorized Bureau of Land Management personnel and permitees or Idaho Fish and Game Department personnel. This closure applies to approximately 15 miles of logging road constructed on four separate timber salvage sales.</textblock>
