    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicant's Representations</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company organized as a Massachusetts business trust. On February 21, 1986, Applicant filed a notification of registration on Form N-8A and a registration statement on Form N-1A which was declared effective on December 23, 1987.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Applicant has three investment Portfolios, each of which serves as the underlying investment medium for five insurance company separate accounts that are registered under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. The insurance companies and separate accounts are: Ameritas Variable Life Insurance Company (AVLIC Separate Account); Fidelity Investments Life Insurance Company (The Fidelity Investments Variable Life Account I); Midland National Life Insurance Company (Midland National Life Separate Account A); Monarch Life Insurance Company (The Fidelity Variable Account); and Vermont Variable Life Insurance Company (Vermont Variable Life Insurance Account).</textblock>
    <textblock>3. On December 29, 1992, pursuant to an application submitted on behalf of each insurance company and separate account named in paragraph 2, the Commission granted an order permitting the substitution of shares of two other investment companies for the shares of Applicant. On December 30, 1992, each insurance company, on behalf of its separate account, redeemed every share it held in each Portfolio of Applicant at net asset value. On December 31, 1992, Applicant's investment adviser, Fidelity Management &amp; Research Company (``FMR Co.''), redeemed its shares of each Portfolio of Applicant at net asset value. Together these constituted all the outstanding shares of Applicant. Each Portfolio's securities consisted solely of zero coupon bonds which were sold on the open market at market value. On January 14, 1993, Applicant's Board of Trustees adopted a resolution directing that Applicant be deregistered under the 1940 Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Applicant currently has no assets, has no security holders or shares outstanding, and is in the process of winding up its affairs.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Applicant has not sold its assets or securities to another investment company, nor transferred its assets to any other trust, nor has it or will it merge into or consolidate with another registered investment company.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceedings.</textblock>
    <textblock>7. Applicant has no debts. There were no expenses incurred in connection with the liquidation. Any expenses involved in the dissolution of Applicant as a Massachusetts business trust will be borne by FMR Corp, the parent company or Applicant's investment adviser, FMR Co.</textblock>
    <textblock>8. Applicant represents that if the order sought herein is granted, it will shortly thereafter file with the Massachusetts Secretary of Commonwealth the documents necessary to dissolve itself as a Massachusetts business trust, thereby ceasing to exist as a legal entity.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.</textblock>
