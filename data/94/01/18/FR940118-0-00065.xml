    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This interim rule implements that portion of subchapter C, part I (Empowerment Zones, Enterprise Communities and Rural Development Investment Areas) of title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103-66, approved August 10, 1993) dealing with the designation of urban Empowerment Zones and Enterprise Communities. This rule authorizes the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to designate not more than six urban Empowerment Zones and not more than 65 urban Enterprise Communities based upon the effectiveness of the strategic plan submitted by a State or States and local government(s) nominating an area for designation.</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of this program is to empower American communities and their residents to create jobs and opportunity, take effective action to solve difficult and pressing economic, human, community and physical development challenges of today, and to build for tomorrow as part of a Federal-State-local and private-sector partnership. Businesses are to be encouraged to invest in distressed areas, thereby creating jobs, and comprehensive local strategic plans are to be adopted and implemented, furthering community development and assisting in the revitalization of these areas.</textblock>
