    <textblock>Notice of license termination.</textblock>
    <textblock>This notice is to inform the public that the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) is terminating Byproduct Material License Number 31-26394-01 issued to Old Vic, Inc. (formerly Victoreen Incorporated) in Cleveland, Ohio. Victoreen Incorporated (Victoreen) used radioactive materials, at its Woodland Avenue facility, for conducting research, instrument calibration, and manufacturing of electronic components, from 1965 until 1987. Victoreen began decommissioning the facility in October 1988. To clarify ownership of the facility and the responsibility for decommissioning, on March 30, 1992, the Commission issued a license to Old Vic, Inc., and terminated Victoreen's license. The Old Vic, Inc., site on Woodland Avenue is listed on the Commission's Site Decommissioning Management Plan. In November 1993, Old Vic, Inc., completed the decommissioning. Based on the remedial actions taken by the licensee, the Commission's staff's review of the licensee's termination surveys, and the results of the Commission's confirmatory surveys, the Commission concludes that decommissioning activities are complete and the site is suitable for unrestricted use.</textblock>
    <textblock>This termination will be reopened only if additional contamination, or noncompliance with the decommissioning plan, is found indicating a significant threat to public health and safety. Noncompliance would occur if the licensee had not complied with an approved decommissioning plan or had provided false information.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dated at Rockville, Maryland this 11th day of January 1994.</textblock>
