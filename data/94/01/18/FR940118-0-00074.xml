    <textblock>Poverty rate.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>General.</textblock>
    <textblock>The poverty rate shall be established in accordance with the following criteria:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) In each census tract within a nominated urban area, the poverty rate shall be not less than 20 percent;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) For at least 90 percent of the population census tracts within the nominated urban area, the poverty rate shall not be less than 25 percent; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) For at least 50 percent of the population census tracts within the nominated urban area, the poverty rate shall be not less than 35 percent.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Special rules relating to the determination of poverty rate.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Census tracts with no population.</textblock>
    <textblock>Census tracts with no population shall be treated as having a poverty rate which meets the standards of paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, but shall be treated as having a zero poverty rate for purposes of applying paragraph (a)(3) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Census tracts with populations of less than 2,000.</textblock>
    <textblock>A population census tract which has a population of less than 2,000 shall be treated as having a poverty rate which meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section if more than 75 percent of the tract is zoned for commercial or industrial use.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Adjustment of poverty rates for Enterprise Communities.</textblock>
    <textblock>Where necessary to carry out the purposes of this part, the Secretary may reduce by 5 percentage points one of the following thresholds for not more than 10 percent of the census tracts, or, if fewer, five population tracts in the nominated urban area:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) The 20 percent threshold in paragraph (a)(1) of this section;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) The 25 percent threshold in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) The 35 percent threshold in paragraph (a)(3) of this section;</textblock>
    <textblock>Provided that</textblock>
    <textblock>, the Secretary may in the alternative reduce the 35 percent threshold by 10 percentage points for three population census tracts.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4)</textblock>
    <textblock>Rounding up of percentages.</textblock>
    <textblock>In making the calculations required by this section, the Secretary shall round all fractional percentages of one-half percent or more up to the next highest whole percentage figure.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c)</textblock>
    <textblock>Noncontiguous areas.</textblock>
    <textblock>A nominated urban area may not contain a noncontiguous parcel unless such parcel separately meets the criteria set forth at paragraphs (a) (1), (2), and (3) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d)</textblock>
    <textblock>Areas not within census tracts.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the case of an area which does not have population census tracts, the block numbering area shall be used.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subpart C_Nomination Procedure</textblock>

    <textblock>One or more local governments and the State or States in which an urban area is located may nominate such area for designation as an Empowerment Zone and/or as an Enterprise Community, if:</textblock>

    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Nomination for designation.</textblock>
    <textblock>No urban area may be considered for designation pursuant to subpart D of this part unless the nomination for designation:</textblock>
