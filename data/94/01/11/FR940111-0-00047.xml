    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This rulemaking sets forth criteria that EPA must consider when exercising its discretionary authority to impose sanctions on a statewide basis pursuant to the Clean Air Act as amended in 1990 (Act). If EPA makes one of the findings of State implementation plan (SIP) deficiency described in the Act, EPA may impose an emissions offset or highway funding sanction on any portion of the State that the Administrator determines is reasonable and appropriate for the purpose of ensuring that the requirements of the Act relating to plans are met. This rulemaking establishes the criteria EPA shall use in exercising its discretionary authority during the 24-month period following a finding of a plan deficiency to ensure that these sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis when one or more political subdivisions are principally responsible for such deficiency. In addition, EPA describes the discretionary sanctions provision and EPA's anticipated application of these sanctions ``at any time'' after the Agency makes a finding.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Overview</textblock>
    <textblock>The EPA is promulgating criteria under section 110(m) of the Act to ensure that, during the 24-month period following a finding, disapproval, or determination (hereinafter ``finding'') referred to in section 179(a), sanctions pursuant to section 110(m) are not applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions are principally responsible for such deficiency. Thus, these criteria apply only in the limited circumstance in which EPA is considering the imposition of statewide sanctions under section 110(m) within 24 months after the Agency makes a section 179(a) finding.</textblock>
