    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 10, 1993, the Postal Service published proposed rule changes to implement recently enacted statutory restrictions on the use of special bulk third-class mail. 58 FR 64918. See also 58 FR 65959 (December 17, 1993) which extended the period for comment on this proposal. A number of customers have requested an opportunity to present their views and concerns in person regarding the proposed rule change. The Postal Service generally does not hold, nor does it generally find a need for, public meetings concerning proposed rules. Nevertheless, in this limited instance, the Postal Service has determined to grant the request for a public meeting. Interested parties may, of course, submit written comments in accordance with the instructions in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>notice. Comments submitted at the meeting may be written or oral. Oral comments will be transcribed for future reference, and will be available for inspection and photocopying between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, in room 8430 at the above address. Individuals wishing to present comments are asked to limit their oral presentations to ten minutes. In order that the Postal Service may properly plan for the meeting, individuals who will attend are required to notify the person identified above by telephone or in writing no later than January 21, 1994.</textblock>
