    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to General Electric Company (GE) CF6-45/-50 series turbofan engines. This proposal would require repetitive inspections of the left compressor discharge pressure (CDP) manifold and lower CDP tube for cracks, and if found cracked, rework or replacement with serviceable parts. This proposal would also require rework or replacement of the left CDP manifold, lower CDP tube, stage 14 turnbuckle, and other related CDP bleed air hardware, and inspection of the compressor rear frame (CRF) as a terminating action to the inspection program. This proposal is prompted by reports of cracks in the left CDP manifold, lower CDP tube, and CRF bleed port struts, that have resulted in inflight engine shutdowns and rejected takeoffs. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent cracks in the left CDP manifold, lower CDP tube, and CRF bleed port struts, which could result in an inflight engine shutdown, rejected takeoff, or damage to the engine nacelle.</textblock>
