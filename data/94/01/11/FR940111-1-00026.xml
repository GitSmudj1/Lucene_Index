    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is requesting public comment on the text of a draft two page generic risk disclosure statement currently being discussed among various international futures regulators that potentially could be used to meet the risk disclosure requirements for both domestic and foreign commodity futures and commodity option products subject to regulation by the CFTC. As contemplated by Commission rule 1.55(c), the text of the generic risk disclosure statement is being published, in part, to further these discussions relative to the development of one document to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements of the CFTC and such foreign jurisdictions as may choose to adopt its language for use in their jurisdictions. Based on the comments received, the CFTC may be better able to provide input to these discussions and to consider rule amendments to permit the substitution of this statement under rule 1.55(c) and certain other rules for firms doing cross-border business.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>On March 30, 1993, the Commission, among other things, adopted final rule amendments to Commission rule 1.55(b) which simplified the risk disclosure process by consolidating the risk disclosure statements applicable to domestic futures transactions and foreign futures and foreign commodity options transactions in rules 1.55 and 30.6, respectively.</textblock>
    <textblock>The use of such a statement was intended to greatly simplify the risk disclosure process for U.S. firms conducting cross-border business.</textblock>
    <textblock>In response to Commission suggestions in the notice of proposed rulemaking concerning rule 1.55 that it also was considering the development of a ``plain language'' options disclosure statement,</textblock>
    <textblock>some commenters supported that course of action and further suggested that the Commission not only shorten the rule 33.7 disclosure statement applicable to exchange-traded commodity option transactions but also consolidate it with the new combined domestic futures and foreign futures and foreign commodity options statement. In response, the Commission noted that certain international regulators were endeavoring to develop a single risk disclosure statement that could be used in multiple jurisdictions to satisfy the risk disclosure requirements applicable to domestic and cross-border transactions in futures and options. The Commission stated that if a universal statement were to be developed, it would consider permitting the use of such a statement in lieu of the new consolidated rule 1.55 risk disclosure statement as well as the options risk disclosure statement required by current rule 33.7.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under amended rule 1.55(c), the Commission may permit the substituted use of a risk disclosure statement approved by a foreign regulatory or self-regulatory organization if the Commission determines that such statement reasonably is calculated to provide the disclosure required by Commission rule 1.55(b).</textblock>
    <textblock>For some time, a working group</textblock>
    <textblock>of international regulators worked towards developing a single risk disclosure statement which could satisfy the risk disclosure requirements applicable, in the multiple participating jurisdictions, to domestic and cross-border transactions in futures and options (``generic disclosure statement'').</textblock>
    <textblock>Following extensive discussions, the draft generic disclosure statement set forth herein was developed and the draft text was passed to those regulatory authorities (including the CFTC) who were interested in taking the work forward. The text remains subject to final discussion and approval by the regulatory authorities of the participating jurisdictions.</textblock>
