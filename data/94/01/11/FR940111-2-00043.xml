    <textblock>FCC Form 405 is used by all common carriers and Multipoint Distribution Service non-common carriers to apply for renewal of radio station licenses. Section 307(c) of the Communications Act of 1934 limits the terms of common carrier radio licenses to ten years and requires that written applications be submitted for renewal. Applicants granted developmental and special temporary authority are required to apply for renewal in shorter intervals_usually one year after date of grant and annually thereafter. FCC Form 405 has been revised to incorporate a certification required by the Commission's rules implementing the provisions of Section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. Licensing Branches evaluate the information submitted; review the particulars and conditions of the current authorization; and take action to renew the license for a new term. If the information were not submitted, the Commission would not be able to carry out its responsibilities mandated by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.</textblock>
