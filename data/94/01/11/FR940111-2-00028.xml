    <textblock>A. Comments in Support of Sec. 34A-2-111</textblock>
    <textblock>Those supporting South Dakota's system for addressing unsigned complaints included the DENR, municipal, agricultural, and mining associations, municipalities, another State agency, and industrial dischargers.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Several commenters questioned the motives of people who submit unsigned complaints and/or the merits of such complaints. They referred to the right to face one's accusers. Their comments included:</textblock>
    <textblock>A few persons stated that unsigned complaints result from feuds, cranks, or competitors.</textblock>
    <textblock>Two expressed the opinion that if a complaint is genuine, the person making it should have the commitment to sign it. A representative of an agricultural group that identified itself as the prime sponsor of Sec. 34A-2-111 stated that ``there should be a great deal of responsibility laid at the feet of those people making the complaint *␣*␣*. [South Dakota is] a stand-up place *␣*␣* South Dakota newspapers, by and large, don't accept letters to the editors that are unsigned. South Dakota State agencies, by and large, do not accept letters of complaint or phone calls that are anonymous. South Dakota Attorney General's office does not accept complaints that are anonymous, with some exceptions.'' Two commenters stated that a person is entitled to face his accusers and is protected from anonymous harassment. One of them cited the Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Some commenters indicated that the state government and the regulated community should be protected from unsigned complaints:</textblock>
    <textblock>One city official noted that unsigned complaints can have a detrimental effect upon an organization otherwise trying to work cooperatively to achieve compliance.</textblock>
    <textblock>``*␣*␣* an anonymous phone call or letter is too easy a method to trigger an environmental audit *␣*␣*.''</textblock>
    <textblock>``[Section] 34A-2-111 is a necessary statute that helps to limit the expenditure of staff time on frivolous personal grudge type complaints.''</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Some commenters praised DENR's record in conducting investigations and allowing for public participation. They also noted the existence of the EPA ``800'' number. Their remarks included:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary, DENR, asserted in his written statement: ``To our knowledge, since the passage of this law [SDCL Section 34A-2-111], this law has never hindered our ability to address water pollution incidents nor has it hindered public involvement.''</textblock>
    <textblock>``*␣*␣* the current SDCL Section 34A-2-111 is working very well. DENR is very responsible in investigating complaints and has a system in place to guarantee that investigations take place once a complaint arises and to keep the identity of the party making the complaint confidential.''</textblock>
    <textblock>A few commenters referred to the fact that EPA is maintaining an ``800'' number for persons not wishing to communicate with the state.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Several commenters indicated that the state's system provides sufficient opportunity for public participation and agency investigation of complaints. They supported this point by identifying three ways in which Section 34A-2-111 was restricted in its applicability:</textblock>
    <textblock>a. The prohibition applies to complaints from the general public, not to complaints made or passed on by another federal, state or local level of government. If DENR determines that it lacks authority to investigate a complaint, the complaint is then referred to another agency.</textblock>
    <textblock>b. The prohibition does not apply to the state's mining laws, solid waste laws, and hazardous waste laws. Most complaints from factory workers will relate to hazardous waste violations, which are not covered by this prohibition.</textblock>
    <textblock>c. The prohibition does not apply to DENR's right of entry, to the issuance of an emergency order, to determinations of responsibility for discharges, to waste disposal into state waters, and to more general authorities to investigate violations of Chapter 34A-2.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Comments Opposing Sec. 34A-2-111</textblock>
    <textblock>Those opposing South Dakota's system for handling unsigned complaints included environmental groups and individuals working in municipal facilities.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Some commenters stated that people hesitate to sign complaints because they fear reprisals:</textblock>
    <textblock>An anonymous individual who described himself or herself as a ``person employed in the wastewater and pretreatment field in the State of South Dakota'' stated, ``Many times people are reluctant to sign complaints because of some type of repercussion.''</textblock>
    <textblock>``It is a reality that many individuals are reluctant to report suspected or obvious discharge violations for fear of reprisal. Real or perceived, it is a reality.''</textblock>
