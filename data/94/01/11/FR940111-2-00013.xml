    <textblock>(c) Each participating market professional agree in writing that, in the event of the bankruptcy, liquidation, or receivership of or other proceeding involving the distribution of funds held by a participating clearing firm against which such market professional has a customer net equity claim in respect of the cross-margining property, such claim shall be subordinated to the customer net equity claims of ``public customers,'' as that term is defined in Commission Regulation 190.01(hh), 17 CFR 190.01(hh), of such clearing firm that do not relate to money, securities, or property in any cross-margining account; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Each participating market professional acknowledge and agree in writing that cross-margining property held for or on his behalf will not be customer property under the Federal securities laws to the extent necessary to effect this Order and will not be customer property under Subchapter III of Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §§741-752 or the Securities Investor Protection Act (``SIPA''), 15 U.S.C. §78aaa</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.,</textblock>
    <textblock>and will not be claimed as such, and will be customer property under the Act, Subchapter IV of Chapter 7 of Title 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 761-766, and part 190 of the Commission's regulations, 17 CFR part 190;</textblock>
    <textblock>Whereas,</textblock>
    <textblock>each participating market professional which signs such a participant agreement will be a customer of a participating FCM;</textblock>
    <textblock>Whereas,</textblock>
    <textblock>each participating clearing firm will treat money, securities, and property received in respect of all accounts other than cross-margining accounts in a manner consistent with the requirements of the Commission and the SEC appropriate thereto;</textblock>
    <textblock>Whereas,</textblock>
    <textblock>SIPC has represented that it has no objection to the agreements under which a participating market professional's cross-margining property would not be deemed to be customer property for the purposes of SIPA; and</textblock>
    <textblock>Whereas,</textblock>
    <textblock>the SEC has concurred with the treatment of securities positions and cross-margining accounts set forth in this Order;</textblock>
    <textblock>Now Therefore, based on the Record in this matter, and provided that the cross-margining proposal submitted by CME and ICC and related proposed rules and rule amendments submitted by ICC are implemented consistently with the representations and agreements cited herein, and provided that:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, and participating market professional execute the agreements referred to herein;</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, and depository separately account for cross-margining property maintained in non-proprietary cross-margining accounts and not commingle such cross-margining property with money, securities, and property maintained in any non-cross-margining accounts or proprietary cross-margining accounts;</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Each participating clearing organization, participating clearing firm, participating market professional, and depository provide the Commission with access to its books and records with respect to non-proprietary cross-margining accounts and positions in a manner consistent with Commission Regulation 1.31, 17 CFR 1.31;</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Each participating clearing firm include all cross-margining property received from participating market professionals as provided herein to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions, or accruing to such participating market professionals as a result of such trades, contracts, commodity option transactions or securities option transactions, when calculating segregation requirements for the purposes of Section 4d of the Act;</textblock>
    <textblock>(e) Each participating clearing firm compute total segregation requirements under Section 4d of the Act and Commission Regulation 1.32, 17 CFR 1.32, by calculating separately the requirements for cross-margining and non-cross-margining accounts without using any net liquidating equity in one account to reduce a deficit in the other;</textblock>
    <textblock>(f) Each participating clearing firm designate non-proprietary cross-margining accounts and positions as such in its books and records, including both internal documents maintained at the firms and account statements sent to participating market professionals;</textblock>
    <textblock>(g) Each participating clearing organization calculate the margin requirements for each non-proprietary cross-margining account separately from the margin requirements for other accounts, including proprietary cross-margining accounts; collect any margin required with respect to non-proprietary cross margining accounts separately without applying any margin in any such account to satisfy a margin requirement in any proprietary account or any non-cross-margining customer account and without applying any margin in a non-cross-margining customer account to satisfy a margin requirement in any proprietary account or any non-proprietary cross-margining account; and maintain all cross-margining property received from participating clearing firms to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions that are effected for non-proprietary cross-margining accounts or held in such accounts, and all accruals resulting from such trades, contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions, separately from money, securities, and property received to margin, guarantee, or secure commodity futures trades, commodity futures contracts, commodity option transactions, or securities option transactions that are effected for or held in any proprietary account or any non-cross-margining customer account, and related accruals; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(h) Each participating clearing organization satisfy any deficiency in a non-proprietary cross-margining account without recourse to non-cross-margining segregated funds;</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Notwithstanding the foregoing, a participating clearing firm may commingle cross-margining property maintained in respect of the non-proprietary cross-margining arrangement among CME, ICC, and OCC with money, securities and property maintained in respect of similar Commission-approved non-proprietary cross-margining arrangements between CME and other commodity clearing organizations, between ICC and other commodity clearing organizations, or between OCC and other commodity clearing organizations, and may apply such commingled money, securities, and property to meet its obligations to a commodity or option clearing organization arising from trades or positions held in its non-proprietary cross-margining account established pursuant to one or more of such cross-margining arrangements, provided that the participating clearing firm:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Separately identify and account for the money, securities and property held pursuant to each of the non-proprietary cross-margining arrangements; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) separately calculate the margin requirements with respect to each of the non-proprietary-cross-margining arrangements, treating each position as being held pursuant to only one such arrangement;</textblock>
    <textblock>It Is Hereby Ordered</textblock>
    <textblock>pursuant to section 4d(2) of the Act:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) That all money, securities, and property received by a participating FCM or a participating B/D affiliated with a participating FCM to margin, guarantee, or secure securities option trades or contracts carried in a non-proprietary-cross-margining account for or on behalf of participating market professionals, or accruing as a result of such trades or contracts, and held subject to the terms of this Order, shall be deemed to have been received by the participating FCM and shall be accounted for and treated and dealt with as belonging to the participating market professional customers of the participating FCM consistently with Section 4d of the Act;</textblock>
