    <textblock>The minimum size or numerical count of the apricots in any package shall be plainly labeled, stenciled, or otherwise marked on the package.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>Numerical count.</textblock>
    <textblock>When the numerical count is used the fruit in any sample shall not vary more than one-fourth inch in diameter. See §51.2928 (b) Size for tolerances.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Minimum size.</textblock>
    <textblock>``Minimum size'' refers to the diameter of the smallest apricot in the package. It shall be stated in terms of whole and eighth inches, as 11/2 inches min., 15/8 inches min., etc., in accordance with the facts.</textblock>
    <textblock>Tolerances</textblock>
    <textblock>§51.2928</textblock>
    <textblock>Tolerances.</textblock>
    <textblock>In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling the following tolerances are provided as specified:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>Defects._</textblock>
    <textblock>(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>U.S. No.1 grade.</textblock>
    <textblock>Not more than 10 percent, by count, of any lot may be below the requirements of this grade and provided that not more than 5 percent, shall be allowed for defects causing serious damage and further provided that not more than 1 percent, shall be allowed for decay.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>U.S. No. 2 grade.</textblock>
    <textblock>Not more than 10 percent, by count, of any lot may be below the requirements of this grade, and not more than one-tenth of this amount, or 1 percent shall be allowed for decay.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Size.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) If packages are marked with numerical count: Not more than 10 percent of the samples in a lot may fail the one-quarter inch variation requirement designated in §51.2927 paragraph (a).</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) If packages are marked with minimum size: Not more than 10 percent, by count, of the apricots in any sample may be below the minimum size specified.</textblock>
    <textblock>Application of Tolerances</textblock>
    <textblock>§51.2929</textblock>
    <textblock>Application of tolerances.</textblock>
    <textblock>Individual samples are subject to the following limitations: Provided, that the averages for the entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the grade.</textblock>
