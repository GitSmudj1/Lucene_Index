    <textblock>The FAA estimates that 173 engines installed on aircraft of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, and that it would not take any additional work hours per engine to accomplish the proposed actions. Replacement parts, prorated for the reduced life, would cost approximately $1,718 per engine. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $297,214.</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``</textblock>

    <textblock>The Proposed Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423;</textblock>
    <textblock>49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง39.13</textblock>
    <textblock>[Amended]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:</textblock>
    <textblock>Rolls-Royce, plc:</textblock>
    <textblock>Docket No. 93-ANE-31</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability:</textblock>
    <textblock>Rolls-Royce, plc (R-R) Spey 506-14 series, 511-14 series, and 555-15 series turbofan engines installed on but not limited to British Aerospace BAC 1-11 and Fokker F28 aircraft.</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance:</textblock>
    <textblock>Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.</textblock>
    <textblock>To prevent a seventh stage high pressure compressor (HPC) disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) For seventh stage HPC disks that on the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD) exceed the revised cyclic life limits described in R-R Service Bulletin (SB) Sp72-1034, Revision 1, dated May 4, 1990, remove from service and replace with a serviceable part within 60 days after the effective date of this AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) For seventh stage HPC disks that on the effective date of this AD do not exceed the revised cyclic life limits described in R-R SB Sp72-1034, Revision 1, dated May 4, 1990, remove from service and replace with a serviceable part: either prior to exceeding the revised cyclic life limits, or within 60 days after the effective date of this AD, whichever occurs later.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety, may be used if approved by the Manager, Engine Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Engine Certification Office.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note:</textblock>
    <textblock>Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Engine Certification Office.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.</textblock>
    <textblock>Issued in Burlington, Massachusetts, on December 29, 1993.</textblock>
