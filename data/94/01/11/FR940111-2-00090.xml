    <textblock>January 5, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1), notice is hereby given that on November 24, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the CBOE. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change</textblock>
    <textblock>The CBOE proposes to designate in its rules the entities that report to the Exchange the current values and the exercise settlement values of the interest rate measures underlying the interest rate options listed for trading on the Exchange. The text of the proposed rule change is available at the Office of the Secretary, CBOE, and at the Commission.</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</textblock>
    <textblock>In its filing with the Commission, the CBOE included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The CBOE has prepared summaries, set forth in sections (A), (B), and (C) below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and the Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of the proposal is to specify the entities that the CBOE has designated to report the current values and the closing exercise settlement values of interest rate measures underlying CBOE's interest rate options. The CBOE believes that the proposed amendment also conforms the procedures currently employed for determining current values and closing exercise settlement values of its short-term interest rate options (``IRX'')</textblock>
    <textblock>with those procedures recently approved by the Commission for the listing and trading on the Exchange of options based on the yields of specified U.S. Treasury notes and bonds (``Long-Term Measures'').</textblock>
    <textblock>As amended, new Interpretation .01 to Rule 23.1 lists Telerate Inc. as the designated reporting authority of current values used for intra-day options pricing purposes and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (``FRBNY'') as the designated reporting authority of spot yields used for calculating the exercise settlement values of interest rate options.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission recently approved those designations in connection with the listing and trading of Long-Term Measures.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposal makes those designations applicable to all interest rate options traded on the Exchange.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, the proposed amendment to Rule 23.1 specifies that the Exchange will use a backup polling procedure to establish applicable underlying values for exercise settlement purposes on those occasions on the last trading day prior to expiration of the interest rate option contracts that the FRBNY does not generate the required spot yields.</textblock>
    <textblock>This polling procedure will be uniform for all interest rate options traded on the Exchange.</textblock>

  <footnote>
    <textblock>The Exchange also currently lists and trades a long-term interest rate option which is based on composite yields of the most recently auctioned seven- and ten-year treasury notes and 30-year Treasury bonds (``LTX''). The Exchange has represented, however, that since the Treasury plans to cease issuing seven-year notes, the Exchange will not issue any new series of LTX contracts.</textblock>

  <footnote>
    <textblock>The spot yield is determined each business day by reference to the price and interest rate of the underlying Treasury security. Customarily, each time the Treasury issues a new note or bond, the new note or bond will become the reference instrument within its issue type. Substitution of the new issue as the reference instrument takes effect on the day following the Treasury's new issue auction. Occasionally, the most recently auctioned issue will not be the longest maturity, and in that circumstance, no substitution will occur.</textblock>

    <textblock>Under this polling procedure, the CBOE's computer will randomly draw the names of ten primary government bond dealers from a list of 16 dealers. Each of the ten dealers will be asked to provide a bid and ask quotation for each relevant Treasury security. A series of checks will be conducted on each set of quotes to ensure the integrity of the process. If a quote is rejected, another dealer will be randomly selected from CBOE's list of government bond dealers to provide the necessary quotations. Once ten acceptable quotes have been obtained, the midpoint of each bid-ask quotation is determined and the midpoints are then averaged to compute the closing yield for the issue.</textblock>
