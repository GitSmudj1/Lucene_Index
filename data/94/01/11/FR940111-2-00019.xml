    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of Energy (DOE), Chicago Field Office, through the Seattle Support Office, announces that pursuant to DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.7(b)(2), it intends to award a cooperative agreement to University of Oregon (UO). The award represents a continuation of DOE funded research for the UO to produce marketable industrialized housing that is more energy efficient. Public Law 95-224 provides the statutory authority for the proposed award.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>UO has been engaged in industrialized housing research for the last four years and has made successful advances to produce marketable industrialized housing that is more energy efficient and has a lower operating and first cost than conventional ``stick-built'' construction. Research under the cooperative agreement will provide needed data to DOE and industry utilizing industrialized housing technologies.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, the financial assistance application is being accepted because the work to be funded is necessary to continue activities presently being funded by DOE and the work will enhance the public benefit. DOE knows of no other entity which is conducting such an activity in the near or distant future. The project period for the cooperative agreement is expected to begin in November 1993 for a five year period. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $10,075,000 for this project period.</textblock>
