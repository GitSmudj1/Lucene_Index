    <textblock>Empirical and testimonial evidence in the record provided insights into the delicate relationship between consumers and funeral providers that appear to affect the degree to which consumers seek price information directly from providers. Results from the Baseline, Replication and Gallup Studies indicated that consumers seldom seek price information or comparison shop by calling providers directly. In 1981, 7.2% of the Baseline Study respondents comparison shopped by contacting more than one funeral home;</textblock>
    <textblock>89</textblock>
    <textblock>4.2% of the 1987 Replication Study respondents did so,</textblock>
    <textblock>90</textblock>
    <textblock>and 11% of the 1988 Gallup Study consumers contacted more than one provider.</textblock>
    <textblock>91</textblock>
    <textblock>Most 1987 Replication Study respondents knew which funeral provider they intended to use,</textblock>
    <textblock>92</textblock>
    <textblock>and those who had not decided on a funeral provider usually contacted only one at the time of need.</textblock>
    <textblock>93</textblock>
    <textblock>In the initial telephone contact, RS respondents asked about ``prices, terms or conditions'' only 9.2% of the time.</textblock>
    <textblock>94</textblock>
    <textblock>Record evidence indicated that both consumers and providers are reluctant to initiate price discussions during funeral arrangements.</textblock>
    <textblock>95</textblock>
    <textblock>The evidence indicates that, unlike a visit to the funeral home, where the general price list facilitates the actual review of services and merchandise, the offer to discuss prices over the telephone is helpful only if the consumer is prepared to do so. The weight of the evidence demonstrates that the initial telephone contact is a tentative encounter in which the consumer is relying on the funeral provider to set the tone of the interaction. The funeral provider at that delicate time, however, reasonably wishes to avoid the appearance of insensitivity by raising price issues when the callers' typical concerns are whether and how to arrange the funeral with the particular provider.</textblock>
    <textblock>Several provider witnesses</textblock>
    <textblock>96</textblock>
    <textblock>testified that the affirmative telephone disclosure has offended callers, who interpret the disclosure as an indication of the funeral provider's preoccupation with the consumer's ability to afford services.</textblock>
    <textblock>97</textblock>
    <textblock>For example, a state funeral board member observed that, whenever a client calls first to arrange a date and time for a funeral service, expecting an empathic response, the consumer is offended by the funeral director's uninvited statement that price information is available, and the funeral provider resentful about having to make such a statement at this early juncture.</textblock>
    <textblock>98</textblock>
    <textblock>Other providers distinguished between the accepted practice of giving price information that is requested, and the difficulty of telling the caller who has not requested it that the funeral provider is prepared to talk about prices.</textblock>
    <textblock>99</textblock>
    <textblock>Funeral director representatives concluded that providers' goodwill is harmed as a result of the offense generated by the unsolicited affirmative disclosure, which providers under the Rule must make during the initial telephone contact.</textblock>
    <textblock>100</textblock>
    <textblock>The evidence further shows that providers experience difficulty in understanding their obligation under ยง453.2 (b)(1)(i). Under that affirmative disclosure provision, a funeral provider must either tell every caller that price information is available, or determine whether an inquiry concerns a ``term,'' ``condition,'' or ``price'' of funeral goods or funeral services offered, thus triggering the disclosure. The original staff Compliance Guidelines illustrated that problem; the Guidelines told funeral providers that a call asking whether the provider will perform a funeral for a particular religion does not trigger the disclosure, whereas a call asking whether the provider will remove the deceased from a hospital does.</textblock>
    <textblock>101</textblock>
    <textblock>The difficulty of determining whether an inquiry concerns a ``term'' or ``condition'' thus places a clear burden on the provider, without a commensurate benefit to the caller.</textblock>
    <textblock>102</textblock>
    <textblock>Other empirical data indicate that the disclosure does not affect consumers' expenditures for funeral arrangements. Economic analysis of the Replication Study data indicated that those consumers who called the provider and received the Rule-required affirmative disclosure spent no less for their arrangements than other respondents.</textblock>

    <textblock>None of the systematic, empirical evidence in the record addressed the question whether the unsolicited disclosure during the initial telephone discussion that price information is available was offensive or confusing to consumers. The Gallup results indicated that most arrangers (83%) are not offended ``when funeral directors give them information about the cost of funeral services when they first begin making arrangements.'' See Colasanto, HX-66 at Appendix B, Tabulations, p. 24. That question, however, refers more specifically to consumers' feelings about actual price information offered by providers during the arrangements conference, such as providers' offer of the GPL, and not to consumers' views about the affirmative telephone disclosure that price information is available.</textblock>

    <textblock>The Commission, however, has not adopted the AARP-suggested modification that would resolve this compliance problem by requiring funeral providers to inform all callers that price information is available over the telephone. The record contains substantial evidence that some consumers would be offended unnecessarily by such unsolicited remarks, and that substantial harm to funeral providers' reputations could occur, without significant consumer benefit. These possibilities further may increase the likelihood of non-compliance, which the evidence suggests may be no greater than 50% at this time. On balance, ensuring that those callers who seek price information can obtain it would better assist consumers in making informed selections.</textblock>
