    <textblock>Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 93-NM-230-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulation that must be issued immediately to correct an unsafe condition in aircraft, and is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866. It has been determined further that this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). If it is determined that this emergency regulation otherwise would be significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures, a final regulatory evaluation will be prepared and placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it, if filed, may be obtained from the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption</textblock>
    <textblock>ADDRESSES.</textblock>
    <textblock>List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</textblock>
    <textblock>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Incorporation by reference, Safety.</textblock>
    <textblock>Adoption of the Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.</textblock>
    <textblock>§39.13</textblock>
    <textblock>[Amended]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:</textblock>
    <textblock>94-01-09␣Canadair:</textblock>
    <textblock>Amendment 39-8791. Docket 93-NM-230-AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability:</textblock>
    <textblock>Model CL-600-2B19 ``Regional Jet'' Series 100 airplanes; serial numbers 7003 and subsequent; certificated in any category.</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance:</textblock>
    <textblock>Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.</textblock>
    <textblock>To prevent undampened vibration of the elevators during normal cruise conditions in the event of hydraulic system failures, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, revise the Limitations Section of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM) to include the following restrictions of altitude and airspeed operations under conditions of single or double hydraulic system failure; and advise the flight crew of these revised limits. Revision of the AFM may be accomplished by inserting a copy of this AD in the AFM.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note 1:</textblock>
    <textblock>The restrictions described in the AFM Temporary Revision (TR) RJ/30 meet the requirements of this paragraph. Therefore, inserting a copy of TR RJ/30 in lieu of this AD in the AFM is considered an acceptable means of compliance with this paragraph.</textblock>
