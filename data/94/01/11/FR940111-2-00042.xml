    <textblock>Review Under Regulatory Flexibility Act and Executive Order 12866</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules that may have a significant impact on a substantial number of entities. The proposed approval of the South Dakota NPDES program does not alter the regulatory control over any industrial category. No new substantive requirements are established by this action. Therefore, because this notice does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not needed.</textblock>
    <textblock>On October 12, 1993, the Office of Management and Budget exempted this Agency action from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dated: December 30, 1993.</textblock>
