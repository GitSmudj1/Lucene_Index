    <textblock>Section 453.4(b) of the Funeral Rule was intended to address all ``bundling'' arrangements imposed on consumers by funeral providers. Under that provision, consumers have the right to decline the purchase of any item, including a casket, from a funeral provider, and may elect to supply their own. That right, however, is illusory if funeral providers can condition consumers' choice on the payment of an additional, non-declinable fee. The fee, in any amount, penalizes consumers for exercising their choice afforded by the Rule.</textblock>

    <textblock>``Casket handling fees'' require consumers to pay two substantial mark-ups, one on the casket they purchase from the third-party seller, and another on the casket they did not buy from the funeral provider. The evidence indicates that handling fees average between $300 and $500, and often are higher. That burden, the evidence shows, effectively removes consumers' economic incentive to purchase a casket from anyone but the funeral provider. Casket sales by third parties have declined as a result, and several retailers have curtailed their marketing efforts or withdrawn from the market. Handling fees thus frustrate the purpose of the Funeral Rule_to ensure informed consumer choice and foster a competitive funeral market. The Commission thus concludes that casket handling fees are unfair conditions on a consumer's right to decline unwanted items he or she may wish to purchase elsewhere, in violation of section 5 of the FTC Act, and the spirit of the Rule's ``unbundling'' provision (ยง453.4(b)).</textblock>

  <footnote>
    <textblock>Section 453.4(b)(2)(ii) of the Rule permits providers to refuse a request for goods and services that would be ``impossible, impractical, or excessively burdensome'' to provide. That provision, however, does not permit a funeral provider to refuse service to a consumer because the consumer supplied the casket. See, e.g., Staff Opinion Letter to George W. Lemke, Executive Director, Casket Manufacturers Association of America (March 18, 1985), FTC File No. 215-46, No. XXVIII-211.</textblock>

  <footnote>
    <textblock>Conditioning the furnishing of any funeral good or service upon the payment of a so-called ``casket handling fee,'' or any other non-declinable fee not otherwise permitted by the Rule, is an unfair practice for the same reasons articulated by the Commission in declaring ``package-only'' pricing unfair when it promulgated the Funeral Rule and its general ``unbundling'' section_453.4(b) (the practice is prevalent and imposes substantial and unavoidable injury on consumers). See R-B-5 (SBP) at 42269-71.</textblock>
