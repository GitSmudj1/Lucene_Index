    <textblock>December 30, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>Take notice that the following filings have been made with the Commission:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Wisconsin Public Service Corporation</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. ER94-282-000]</textblock>
    <textblock>Take notice that on December 17, 1993, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPSC) requested the Commission to disclaim jurisdiction over a retail rate schedule under which WPSC serves the Du Bay Campground in Mosinee, Wisconsin (``the Campground) at WPSC's rural small commercial and industrial (CG-2) rate, or if the Commission asserts jurisdiction, to accept the agreement for filing and waive the notice requirement to allow that the rate schedule to become effective May 1, 1992.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment date:</textblock>
    <textblock>January 12, 1994, in accordance with Standard Paragraph E at the end of this notice.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Wisconsin Public Service Corporation</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. ER94-281-000]</textblock>
    <textblock>Take notice that on December 17, 1993, Wisconsin Public Service Corporation (WPSC) requested the Commission to disclaim jurisdiction over a retail rate schedule CZ-1 under which WPSC served the Northern Mobile Home Court (Northern) until November of 1993. WPSC provided the service to Northern under ``Option 2'' of rate schedule, which provides that the customer may install its own meters at each trailer stall and rebill electric service to the tenant. WPSC asserts that the service is clearly nonjurisdictional; however, WPSC wishes to be absolutely certain to avoid any late filing penalties. If the Commission asserts jurisdiction, WPSC requests that the CZ-1 rate schedule be accepted for filing and that the notice requirement be waived to allow that rate schedule to become effective as to the Northern service on January 1, 1963, which is approximately when service to Northern commenced.</textblock>
