    <textblock>The following parties have filed petitions to modify the application of mandatory safety standards under section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. New Warwick Mining Company</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. M-93-323-C]</textblock>
    <textblock>New Warwick Mining Company, R.D. 1, Box 167A, Mount Morris, Pennsylvania 15349 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(1) (weekly examination) to its Warwick Mine (I.D. No. 36-02374) located in Greene County, Pennsylvania. Due to hazardous roof conditions, certain areas of the mine cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to establish evaluations points to monitor for methane and the quantity of air in the affected areas. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternate method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Costain Coal, Inc.</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. M-93-324-C]</textblock>
    <textblock>Costain Coal, Inc., P.O. Box 289, Sturgis, Kentucky 42459-0289 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b) (weekly examination) to its Baker Mine (I.D. No. 15-14492) located in Webster County, Kentucky. The petitioner requests that the minimum volume of air reaching the inby monitoring point be 5,000 cubic feet per minute. In addition, the petitioner proposes to physically examine the affected areas weekly rather than daily because the mine wide atmospheric monitoring system, with a proposed additional sensor to measure air velocity, would provide the necessary monitoring. This petition modifies a Decision and Order on a previous petition, docket number M-92-94-C. The petitioner states that the proposed alternate method would not result in a diminution of safety to the miners.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Consolidation Coal Company</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. M-93-325-C]</textblock>
    <textblock>Consolidation Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241-1421 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.343(b) (underground shops) to its Loveridge No. 22 Mine (I.D. No. 46-01433) located in Marion County, West Virginia. The petitioner proposes to ventilate the underground motor barn with intake air that is coursed through the affected air course directly into a return air course and that is not used to ventilate working places; and to establish check points to monitor for methane and the quantity of air in the affected area on a weekly basis. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. North Mountain Coal Company</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. M-93-326-C]</textblock>
    <textblock>North Mountain Coal Company, R.D. #1, Box 32A, Dornsife, Pennsylvania 17823 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.1002-1(a) (location of other electric equipment; requirements for permissibility) to its West Side South Dip (I.D. No. 36-07681) located in Northumberland County, Pennsylvania. The petitioner proposes to use nonpermissible electric equipment within 150 feet of the pillar line and to suspend equipment</textblock>
    <textblock>operation anytime the methane concentration at the equipment reaches 0.5 percent either during operation or a preshift examination.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. McElroy Coal Company</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. M-93-327-C]</textblock>
    <textblock>McElroy Coal Company, 1800 Washington Road, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15241-1421 has filed a petition to modify the application of 30 CFR 75.364(b)(2) (weekly examination) to its McElroy Mine (I.D. No. 46-01437) located in Marshall County, West Virginia. Due to deteriorating roof conditions, certain areas of the return air course cannot be traveled safely. The petitioner proposes to establish evaluation points at specific locations and to have a certified person monitor for methane and the quantity and quality of air at these evaluation points on a weekly basis and record the results in a book kept on the surface. The petitioner asserts that the proposed alternative method would provide at least the same measure of protection as would the mandatory standard.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. Sonora Mining Corporation</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. M-93-13-M]</textblock>
    <textblock>Sonora Mining Corporation, P.O. Box 1418, Jamestown, California 95327 has filed a petition to modify the application</textblock>
    <textblock>of 30 CFR 56.9300 (berms or guardrails) to its Jamestown Mine (I.D. No. 04-04695) located in Tuolumne County, California. The petitioner proposes to eliminate the use of berms during construction of the final lift on the tailings dam and place material on the dam in one-foot compact layers in order to comply with the California State Division of Dam Safety. The petitioner states that the height of the dam (200</textblock>
    <textblock>â€™) has reached a point where the width on top will not allow enough room for scrapers to travel and dump their loads if berms are used. In addition, the petitioner states that to maintain a safe work environment, mobile equipment that would work on top would drive forward only.</textblock>
