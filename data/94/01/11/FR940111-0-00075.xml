    <textblock>b. Market price-sensitivity.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consumers' demand for funerals, of course, is price inelastic. Record evidence indicates, however, that consumers' selections of individual funeral providers, overall types of funeral service, and individual funeral goods and services are price-sensitive.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consumers value available price information in selecting a funeral home and in making specific funeral arrangements, particularly when they receive the price information early in selecting funeral goods and services. With respect to the selection of a provider, 52% of NSM survey respondents in the years 1983-1988 said that they considered price ``very important'' in their funeral home selection, although other factors appeared to be more important; only 19% considered price unimportant.</textblock>
    <textblock>Similarly, ``low-cost'' funeral homes, where they exist, have increased their business substantially in recent years as a direct result of their competitive pricing practices.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regarding the selection of specific goods and services, many consumers are purchasing competitively-priced caskets from third-party sellers when they are available,</textblock>
    <textblock>are increasingly choosing the significantly less-expensive cremation alternative,</textblock>
    <textblock>are purchasing significantly fewer caskets and requesting embalming for cremation less frequently than in 1981,</textblock>
    <textblock>and are declining items that used to be included in funeral ``packages.''</textblock>
    <textblock>Replication Study consumers who received price information early in the transaction spent $252 less for their specific arrangements than those who did not get that timely information;</textblock>
    <textblock>the earlier consumers received price information, the more likely they were to consider the information important to their choices in making funeral arrangements.</textblock>
    <textblock>c. Pro-competitive/informational benefits.</textblock>
    <textblock>Despite the 31% overall industry compliance level with four of the Rule's key requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>and the lack of price competition among funeral homes, competitive and informational benefits that are at least partially attributable to the Rule have begun to manifest in the funeral market. Testimonial evidence establishes that the Rule's ``unbundling'' and price disclosure provisions have encouraged third-party casket sellers and low-cost funeral homes to enter the market and have helped them compete,</textblock>
    <textblock>in part because the GPL and telephone disclosure requirements permit non-industry entities to gather and publish comparative price data.</textblock>
    <textblock>Many consumers have used that data to select those lower-cost funeral providers and purchase caskets from third-party sellers where they exist.</textblock>

    <textblock>The analysis is based on R-J-11, NSM Summary sheets, Question 1.f. See also, R-M-5 at 7-8. The NSM Survey results are remarkably similar to those of the RS concerning the importance of price. That data indicate that 56% of the survey respondents reported that the cost of funeral arrangements was ``very'' or ``somewhat'' important in their decision to select the funeral home they used; 15% reported that cost was somewhat or very unimportant.

    <textblock>The BE analysis showed that cremation selections increased from 11% in 1981 to 14% in 1987, and that the average cremation cost to 1987 respondents was about one-third of the cost of open-casket funerals ($1,054 vs. $2,818). HX-122 at Table II, p. 6, Table III, p. 7. BE staff noted that the close similarity of the survey results to cremation statistics provided by the CANA suggests that the BLS and RS are representative of the national population.</textblock>

    <textblock>Thirty-four percent of cremation buyers in 1981 also purchased caskets, and 35 percent bought embalming services; those selections dropped in 1987 to 19% (caskets) and 25% (embalming). R-B-3 (BLS) at Table 3, p. 23; R-B-2 (RS) at Table III-44, p. III-71 (caskets) and Table III-42, p. III-67 (embalming). Similarly, CANA member surveys indicate a reduction in the purchase of caskets for cremation from 22% to 17% between 1983 and 1987, a reduction which the CANA attributed to the Rule. See Kelsey, Tr. Vol. II, 310-312, Purdy, Tr. Vol. III, 158.</textblock>

    <textblock>Seventy-six percent of consumers who received price information ``at the beginning'' of arrangements discussions said that price information was very or somewhat important; 75% said so when they got price information ``before casket selection;'' 62% who reported that they received such information ``when finalizing arrangements'' said that it was very or somewhat important at that time; 67% said so when they got the information ``after decisions had been made;'' and 53% said so when there was ``no discussion of price.'' In the first three periods above, 41%, 31%, and 22% of respondents, respectively, said that price information was ``very'' important. The analysis is based on consumers' answers to RS questions 27 (when price information was first received) and 35(c)(5) (importance of price information in arranging the funeral).
