    <textblock>Applicants' Representations</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The Fund, incorporated in 1981 under the laws of the state of Maryland, is an open-end, non-diversified management investment company registered under the Act. The Fund's investment adviser is EQSF Advisers, Inc. (``EQSF''). The Fund does not qualify to elect to be taxed as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, and thus pays taxes on its income in the same manner as a business corporation. As of October 31, 1993, approximately 92% of the Fund's assets consisted of the common stock of Nabors.</textblock>
