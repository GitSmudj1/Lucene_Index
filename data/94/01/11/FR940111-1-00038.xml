    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission by Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62077) proposed amendments to its Non-Vessel-Operating Common Carriers (NVOCC) coloading rules to clarify ambiguities and to address current practices resulting in increased application of untariffed NVOCC charges. Sixty days was allowed for comment. Requests for additional time to comment ranging from 30 to 90 days have been filed by various interests. Upon consideration of the requests, the Commission has determined to grant a 30-day extension, thereby providing a total of 90 days for comment, which is deemed adequate under the circumstances.</textblock>
