The letter should identify the specific program announcement number, indicate the intended submission deadline, and include the name of the principal investigator. The letter of intent does not influence review or funding decisions, but it will enable CDC to plan the review more efficiently, and will ensure that each applicant receives timely and relevant information prior to application submission.</textblock>
