    <textblock>One environmental organization urged EPA to engage in formal consultation with the FWS pursuant to Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. Another environmental group questioned whether EPA had complied with requirements to consult with the FWS and with the State Game, Fish, and Parks Department.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. EPA's Response to Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>The EPA successfully completed informal consultation with the U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, as described above. Therefore, there was no need to engage in the formal consultation process.</textblock>
    <textblock>VII. Overall Delegation Issues</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA received a number of public comments regarding the overall capability and intent of the DENR to administer an authorized NPDES program.</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Comments Regarding the Benefits of Delegation</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Many commenters praised the capabilities, competency, knowledge, and past performance of the DENR staff.</textblock>
    <textblock>``*␣*␣*␣we have relied on the South Dakota Department of Environment and Natural resources as a resource for questions and concerns we have had with the NPDES program. We have found the DENR to be staffed by a group of well-informed professionals dedicated to the enhancement of water quality. Their guidance and advice have always been valuable␣*␣*␣*.''</textblock>
    <textblock>``The DENR has established itself as a very competent department and has a very positive working relationship with a variety of industries within the state. The DENR will be very effective in administering and enforcing the NPDES program for the State of South Dakota *␣*␣* we haven't always agreed with DENR on our positions, but let me say clearly we have always been treated very fairly.'' ``To me, the State seems very capable of making decisions and taking action, while at the Federal level, response does not occur with promptness.''</textblock>
    <textblock>``We are aware of the efforts the Department made prior to and during the 1992 State Legislative session to secure funding needed to upgrade staff capability to take over management of the NPDES program.''</textblock>
    <textblock>``*␣*␣* environmental regulations are best administered at the state level. State administration provides both the permittee and the regulator better opportunity for face to face communication and for better understanding of the specifics of an operation through regular inspections. Administration and enforcement are both enhanced by having the regulators in close proximity to the regulated facilities.''</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Numerous commenters emphasized the advantages of regulation by an agency actually in the State. Comments included the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>``EPA technical staff are normally available by phone only, while state staff are frequent visitors to the area and are available for valuable on-site assistance␣*␣*␣*. Our experience in working with [a delegated state regarding other facilities] has been one where positive environmental benefits have been achieved in an efficient, timely manner. We deal directly and in person with all the regulatory people involved, which drastically reduces the questions of interpretation, improves timeliness of permit compliance and in the end provides quicker, effective solutions to environmental problems.''</textblock>
    <textblock>``I believe that delegation of the NPDES program for regulating the discharges of pollutants into waters within the State will mean a more effective operation on both a programmatic and cost basis.''</textblock>
    <textblock>``We are as concerned for the environment of our employees as much as anyone else is, but we have a desire for cooperation rather than dictation.''</textblock>
    <textblock>``I believe a program administered by the state of South Dakota, with regional offices in efforts to help industry clean up our environment, should we be polluting it, would be a tremendous benefit to all manufacturers.''</textblock>
    <textblock>``Having the answers in state and accountable to South Dakotans will enhance businesses' ability to comply.''</textblock>
    <textblock>``[The State Feedlot Program Regulation Review]␣*␣*␣*. Committee concluded that State management of the NPDES program was needed to accomplish effective regulation of feedlot wastes in South Dakota.''</textblock>
    <textblock>``The National Performance Review recently cited recommendations to create a system of program delivery that works better and costs less. The very first recommendation (EPA01) specifically states: `Improve Environmental Protection Through Increased Flexibility for Local Government'. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has a real opportunity today to act on this recommendation by approving South Dakota's application!''</textblock>
    <textblock>``There are several reasons why the Legislature supported this [Second Century Environmental Protection] Act:</textblock>
    <textblock>_State administration of the federal program would enhance economic development;</textblock>
    <textblock>_Improved coordination would exist between local and state governmental agencies; and</textblock>
    <textblock>_The state would better safeguard the public health, safety, welfare and the environment of this state through a customer service approach.''</textblock>
