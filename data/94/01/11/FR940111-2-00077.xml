    <textblock>Pub. L. 101-509, Title VI_General Provisions Section 629, 104 Stat. 1478 (1990) permits Federal agencies to participate in any program established by State or local government that encourages employees to use public transportation.

Pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act, the following proposed amendments are necessary for information collection and maintenance of the fare subsidy program records. These changes to MSPB/Internal-1, Pay, Leave, and Travel records, are administrative in nature, and are not within the purview of the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552 a(r). MSPB/Internal-1 was last published on April 27, 1990, 55 FR 17842. The specific changes to the notice being amended are set forth below.</textblock>
