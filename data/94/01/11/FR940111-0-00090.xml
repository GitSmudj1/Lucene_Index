    <textblock>III. Other Matters</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Final Regulatory and Regulatory Flexibility Analyses</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission has determined that these amendments to the Funeral Rule will not have an annual effect on the national economy of $100 million or more, or otherwise have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small business. The preponderance of the evidence in the record indicates that the Rule overall has not significantly increased funeral providers' costs of doing business, and that the amendments will reduce any costs to providers imposed by the Rule's requirements, by making it easier for them to comply. Therefore, pursuant to the exception for Rule amendments contained in section 22(a)(1)(A) of the FTC Act, and the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 604, 605, section 22 of the Act requiring that the Commission issue a final regulatory analysis with the promulgation of a final rule does not apply to this amended Rule.</textblock>
