    <textblock>January 5, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Introduction</textblock>
    <textblock>On September 22, 1993, the Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (``CBOE'' or ``Exchange'') submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') or ``Commission''), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')</textblock>
    <textblock>and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,</textblock>
    <textblock>a proposed rule change to provide for the listing and trading of index options on the Nasdaq 100 Index (``Nasdaq Index'' or ``Index'').</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed rule change was published for comment in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 33166 (November 8, 1993), 58 FR 60710 (November 17, 1993). No comment letters were received on the proposed rule change. This order approves the Exchange's proposal.</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Description of Proposal</textblock>
    <textblock>A. General</textblock>
    <textblock>The CBOE proposes to trade options on the Nasdaq Index, a stock index calculated and maintained by the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (``Nasdaq''), a subsidiary of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (``NASD''). The CBOE also proposes to list long-term options (``LEAPS'') on the Index. Index LEAPS will trade independent of and in addition to regular Index options traded on the Exchange.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Composition of the Index</textblock>
    <textblock>The Index contains one hundred of the largest non-financial securities issued by U.S. issuers and traded on the Nasdaq National Market. Nasdaq will use a capitalization-weighted method to calculate the Index.</textblock>
    <textblock>As of January 3, 1994 the Index was at 398.28.</textblock>
    <textblock>As of October 25, 1993, the market capitalizations of the individual stocks in the Index ranged from a high of $26.8 billion to a low of $437 million, with the mean and median being $2.54 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. The market capitalization of all the stocks in the Index was $253.8 billion. The total number of shares outstanding for the stocks in the Index ranged from a high of 536 million shares to a low of 15.1 million shares. The average price per share of the stocks in the Index, for a six-month period between April 1, 1993 and September 1, 1993, ranged from a high of $103.29 to a low of $6.15. In addition, the average daily trading volume of the stocks in the Index, for the same six-month period, ranged from a high of 2.853 million shares per day to a low of 10,579 shares per day, with the mean and median being 631,631 and 407,639 shares, respectively. Lastly, no one stock comprised more than 10.54% of the Index's total value and the percentage weighting of the five largest issues in the Index accounted for 33.27% of the Index's value. The percentage weighting of the lowest weighted stock was 0.17% of the Index and the percentage weighting of the five smallest issues in the Index accounted for 1.12% of the Index's value.</textblock>
    <textblock>C. Maintenance</textblock>
    <textblock>The Index will be maintained by Nasdaq. Nasdaq has notified the CBOE that it recently updated the list of securities comprising the Index and will continue to make revisions to the Index on an annual basis. Nasdaq also, in its discretion, will make special adjustments to the securities comprising the Index to reflect such events as stock splits or reverse splits, spinoffs, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations, and similar events, upon their occurrence.</textblock>
    <textblock>D. Calculation of the Index</textblock>
    <textblock>The Index will be calculated using a capitalization-weighting methodology. The representation of each security in the Index will be proportional to the security's last sale price times the total number of shares outstanding, in relation to the total market value of all of the securities in the Index. The level of the Index is calculated as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>The numerical value of the Index was established at 250 prior to the opening of the market on February 1, 1985. At the close of the market on December 31, 1993, the Index was at 796.56. Then, effective January 3, 1994, the Index value was halved, creating an Index level of 398.28 at the market opening on January 3, 1994. The Index is calculated and disseminated every fifteen seconds to market information vendors. Nasdaq will also calculate the exercise settlement value for each expiring series of Nasdaq Index options and make this value available to the CBOE for use by the Options Clearing Corporation in effecting settlement of exercises and assignments of the options.</textblock>
