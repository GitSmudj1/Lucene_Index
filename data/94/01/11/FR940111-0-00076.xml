    <textblock>Other testimonial evidence presented by the FFDA, which provides financial and accounting services to 1,500 independent funeral home clients in 30 states, indicates that the Rule_through the availability of the GPL_has raised the industry's ``price consciousness,'' which may be partly responsible for the tempering of price increases in recent years.</textblock>
    <textblock>Mandatory itemization may have helped retard the growth of funeral prices and consumer expenditures, a goal fully intended by the Commission.</textblock>
    <textblock>Statistical data provided by the FFDA and the Replication Study, and analyzed by an economist for the AARP and the BE staff, also establish that, although overall prices and consumer expenditures for funerals increased since 1981 by more than the general price level (the ``CPI-U''), which includes all goods and services, the increase was comparable to the increase in service prices (the ``CPI-US,'' which excludes medical services); that is, compared to other service industries,</textblock>
    <textblock>funeral prices and expenditures in the period 1981-1987 did not increase above the rate of inflation.</textblock>
    <textblock>In 1988, expenditures and prices for funeral services increased by even less than the rate of inflation for the general economy (the ``CPI-U'').</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition to these benefits, record evidence discussed above suggests that the Rule has helped increase consumers' awareness of prices and service options as factors to consider in making funeral purchase decisions. Many consumers choose low-cost funeral homes and caskets competitively offered by third-party providers, and consumers who chose cremation in 1987 purchased fewer caskets and embalming than in 1981. Finally, that evidence indicated that consumers now decline items once included in packaged funerals, and increasingly choose less-expensive cremation alternatives.</textblock>
    <textblock>Other empirical evidence indicates that, since 1981, the proportion of consumers who receive price information early in the funeral transaction, and use that information to spend less for their arrangements, has increased by 7%.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consumer purchases of ``unneeded'' caskets and embalming for cremation have decreased,</textblock>
    <textblock>as have provider misrepresentations about casket requirements,</textblock>
    <textblock>and the accuracy of consumers' knowledge regarding casket for cremation and embalming requirements and the preservative value of sealed caskets has increased slightly.</textblock>
    <textblock>The great majority of rulemaking participants expressed the view that the actual and potential Rule benefits just enumerated will tend to increase over time, as compliance with, and consumer awareness of, the Rule increases.</textblock>
    <textblock>Although not directly related to pro-competitive and informational benefits, other empirical evidence based on the Replication Study data and BE staff's compliance indices indicates that the proportion of consumers reporting satisfaction with their arrangements steadily increases as simultaneous provider compliance with the Rule's provisions increases.</textblock>
    <textblock>That evidence indicates that compliance with the Rule benefits consumers and funeral providers by increasing consumer satisfaction with funeral service, and that the level of satisfaction might continue to increase if compliance with the Rule were greater.</textblock>
    <textblock>d. Costs to providers.</textblock>
    <textblock>While the Rule has begun to provide benefits to consumers, empirical evidence demonstrates that its requirements have not been a significant contributing factor to increases in funeral home costs of doing business or funeral home prices, or to any reduction of overall consumer satisfaction with funeral services. Funeral provider groups, however, asserted that the Rule has imposed on providers a variety of increased costs, most notably for personnel as a result of a 23-minute average increase in the duration of the arrangements conference, and for business expenses such as printing, accounting and legal services. These costs, those groups said, have been passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, particularly for professional services.</textblock>

    <textblock>The funeral home industry is classified by the U.S. Dept. of Commerce in the standard industrial classification scheme (SIC) as a ``service'' industry, because, like other service industries, it sells services as well as goods.</textblock>

    <textblock>See R-N-1 (SR) at 76, 79-80. Even if overall industry compliance were higher and consumer expenditures still remained unchanged, the level of expenditures is not the sole test of the Rule's benefits. As the BE staff stated in its report, expenditures may rise as a result of price increases related to funeral homes' fixed costs that are not associated with any costs of Rule compliance. The record evidence indicates, in fact, that Rule compliance has not significantly increased funeral providers' costs or prices, that consumer expenditures and funeral prices, when compared to other service industries, have not increased above inflation, and that an industry ``price consciousness'' induced by the availability of the GPL may have tempered price increases. If the Rule's only benefit were to increase informed consumer choice (without imposing substantial costs on industry), regardless of whether some chose to spend more for their arrangements than they would have without the Rule, that benefit would likely justify retention of the Rule because other consumers would have the right to choose to spend less. The Commission in its 1982 SBP for the Rule so stated the Rule's purpose. The record evidence in fact indicates that many consumers will purchase fewer funeral items or less-expensive services as a result of informed choice.</textblock>

    <textblock>Although the record evidence supports the conclusion that the Rule facilitates consumers' choice of cremation, the degree to which the Rule has affected the cremation rate is unclear from the record evidence. The NFDA suggested that the Rule has not played an important role in the steadily increasing cremation rate, because the increase began in the early 1970s and is based primarily on changing social and moral values, as well as on the wishes of the deceased, and not on price concerns. The CANA and the AARP, in contrast, asserted that the Funeral Rule proceedings, which also began in the early 1970s, as well as the Rule itself, substantially increased publicity about the cremation alternative, and that many consumers do choose cremation based on price and other considerations. The CANA also provided evidence that the marketing of cremation options has dramatically increased since the Rule's inception. See R-N-1 (SR) at 68-71.</textblock>

    <textblock>That data show that, in 1981, 18% and 11% of ``direct cremation'' purchasers, respectively, appear to have bought embalming services and caskets that were unnecessary, because the body is not present during the service (making embalming unnecessary) and is not buried (making a casket unnecessary). In 1987, those figures declined to 9% (unneeded embalming) and 2% (unneeded caskets), respectively. See R-M-5 (Staff Rebuttal) at 9; R-B-2 (RS) and R-B-3 (BLS) data tapes. The decline in unneeded casket purchases is statistically significant.</textblock>
    <textblock>Record data also indicate that those arguably ``unneeded'' casket purchases occurred in many cases as a result of funeral director misrepresentations. Those data show that in all but one case, in instances where cremation was selected, consumers purchased a casket when told that one was required_8 of 9 instances in 1981, and 2 of 2 in 1987.

    <textblock>Seven percent of those 1987 RS respondents who purchased cremations said that the providers they used represented that a casket was required, as opposed to 26% of 1981 cremation buyers. See R-B-2 at IV-8; R-N-1 (SR) at 39, n. 149. The 26% figure may be somewhat overstated, however, because, unlike the RS, the 1981 BLS question did not include a response category permitting the compliant statement that an unfinished wood box (an alternative container that is arguably a type of casket) was required. Eleven percent of the 1987 RS respondents answered the question that way.</textblock>
