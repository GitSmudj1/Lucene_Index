    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Office of Hearings and Appeals (OHA) amends several existing rules that govern procedures for hearings and appeals under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 in order to bring the rules up to date. Because of events that have occurred since they were adopted, the existing rules omit references or contain incorrect references, are inconsistent with other rules, or fail to provide necessary information or procedures. The amendments correct these defects. In this document OHA also updates telephone numbers of offices of field solicitors and field offices of the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement (OSM), listed in the existing rules, to reflect changes which have been effected heretofore.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 19, 1991, OHA proposed amendments to existing procedural rules governing hearings and appeals under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 1201</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1988), because rules subsequently adopted or cases decided have rendered the existing rules out of date or shown them to be incomplete or inaccurate. See 56 FR 58330-58332 (Nov. 19, 1991). No comments were received on the published proposed amendments. The amendments effected by this final rulemaking are explained below under the heading for each rule involved.</textblock>
    <textblock>Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1100</textblock>
    <textblock>As a result of previous amendments of 43 CFR 4.1109(a) to provide current addresses and jurisdictions of field solicitors who are to be served documents (see 56 FR 2139, 2142-43 (Jan. 22, 1991), 56 FR 5061 (Feb. 7, 1991)), the definition of ``field solicitor'' in 43 CFR 4.1100(d) is superfluous. It was proposed to remove that definition and redesignate the following definitions in alphabetical order. No comments were received on this proposal. That definition is therefore removed and the following definitions (e) and (f) are redesignated (d) and (e).</textblock>
    <textblock>Amendment of 43 CFR 4.1105(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>30 CFR 842.15(d) provides a right of appeal to the Interior Board of Land Appeals (IBLA or the Board) under 43 CFR 4.1280</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>of the written determination, after informal review by the Director of the OSM or his or her designee, concerning the decision of an authorized representative of the Secretary not to inspect or take enforcement action concerning an alleged violation that is the subject of a request for a federal inspection under 30 CFR 842.12.</textblock>
    <textblock>Similarly, 30 CFR 843.12(i) provides that any determination by an authorized representative of the Secretary granting or denying an abatement period exceeding 90 days under 30 CFR 842.12(h) shall contain a right of appeal to IBLA under 1280</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
