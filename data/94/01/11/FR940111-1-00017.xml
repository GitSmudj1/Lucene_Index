    <textblock>ยง39.13</textblock>

    <textblock>2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new airworthiness directive:</textblock>
    <textblock>Rolls-Royce, plc:</textblock>
    <textblock>Docket No. 93-ANE-43.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability:</textblock>
    <textblock>Rolls-Royce, plc (R-R) Spey 506-14 series, 511-14 series, and 555-15 series turbofan engines, installed on but not limited to British Aerospace BAC 1-11 series and Fokker F28 series aircraft.</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance:</textblock>
    <textblock>Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.</textblock>
    <textblock>To prevent a high pressure turbine (HPT) or low pressure turbine (LPT) steel turbine disk burst due to cracking attributed to corrosion, which may result in an uncontained engine failure, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Perform a one-time inspection for cracks and corrosion pitting in steel stage 1 and stage 2 HPT disks that on the effective date of this airworthiness directive (AD) have completed 40% or more of their published Group ``A'' lives, in accordance with the procedures and schedule described in R-R Service Bulletin (SB) No. Sp72-1044, dated September 1992, at the next shop visit after the effective date of this AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Perform a one-time inspection for cracks and corrosion pitting in steel stage 1 and stage 2 HPT disks that on the effective date of this AD have completed less than 40% of their published Group ``A'' lives, in accordance with the procedures and schedule described in R-R SB No. Sp72-1044, dated September 1992, at the first shop visit after completing 40% of their published Group ``A'' lives.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Perform a one-time inspection for cracks and corrosion pitting in steel stage 1 and stage 2 LPT disks that on the effective date of this AD have completed 40% or more of their published Group ``A'' lives, in accordance with the procedures and schedule described in R-R SB No. Sp72-1044, dated September 1992, at the next shop visit after the effective date of this AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Perform a one-time inspection for cracks and corrosion pitting in steel stage 1 and stage 2 LPT disks that on the effective date of this AD have completed less than 40% of their published Group ``A'' lives, in accordance with the procedures and schedule described in R-R SB No. Sp72-1044, dated September 1992, at the first shop visit after completing 40% of their published Group ``A'' lives.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e) Replace with a serviceable part, disks that do not meet the inspection requirements described in section 72-50 of the applicable R-R Spey Engine Overhaul Manual, prior to return to service.</textblock>
    <textblock>(f) Mark disks that meet the inspection requirements described in section 72-50 of the applicable R-R Spey Engine Overhaul Manual in accordance with R-R SB No. Sp72-1044, dated September 1992, prior to return to service.</textblock>
    <textblock>(g) For the purpose of this AD, a shop visit is defined as an engine removal where engine maintenance entails removal of either HPT or LPT disks for the purposes of scheduled disk inspections.</textblock>
    <textblock>(h) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Engine Certification Office. The request should be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Engine Certification Office.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note:</textblock>
    <textblock>Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this airworthiness directive, if any, may be obtained from the Engine Certification Office.</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.</textblock>
