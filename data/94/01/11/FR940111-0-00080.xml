    <textblock>Some ANPR commenters asserted that funeral providers, in response to emerging competition in the sale of caskets from cemeteries and other third-parties, charge high ``casket handling fees'' for arrangements where consumers supply their own caskets purchased from those third parties.</textblock>
    <textblock>117</textblock>
    <textblock>The alleged purpose of these fees was to recoup overhead costs and profits built into casket prices but lost on the third-party casket sales. The Commission in the NPR thus sought comment on the existence and impact of so-called ``casket handling fees,'' and on whether, and how, the Rule should address that practice.</textblock>
    <textblock>118</textblock>
    <textblock>a. Existence and impact.</textblock>
    <textblock>Members of the third-party, casket seller industry</textblock>
    <textblock>119</textblock>
    <textblock>provided empirical and other evidence on the purpose, widespread existence and impact of these ``casket handling fees.'' Casket seller representatives asserted that the emergence of third-party casket sellers is directly attributable to the Funeral Rule's ``unbundling'' provision; those sales were virtually non-existent before the Rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>120</textblock>
    <textblock>A PAA official who presented the results of a PAA membership survey (the ``PAA Survey'') on handling fee issues, Mr. Duke Radovich, estimated that there are between 100 and 200 casket retailers in the country.</textblock>
    <textblock>121</textblock>
    <textblock>The PAA Survey provided empirical evidence on the widespread existence and amount of ``casket handling fees,'' as reported by the respondent retailers. Eighty-six percent of the respondents said that at least 60% of the funeral homes in their market area assess handling fees, about two-thirds said that 80% to 100% charge the fees, and one-quarter reported that all of the homes impose the casket handling fee.</textblock>
    <textblock>122</textblock>
    <textblock>Mr. Radovich concluded that a substantial number of providers assess ``casket handling fees'' wherever third-party sellers exist.</textblock>
    <textblock>123</textblock>
    <textblock>Individual casket retailers agreed with that finding,</textblock>
    <textblock>124</textblock>
    <textblock>and further testified that funeral providers began imposing handling fees when third-party casket sellers entered the market.</textblock>
    <textblock>125</textblock>
    <textblock>Concerning the amount of ``casket handling fees'' assessed, 81% of the PAA Survey respondents said that the average handling fee was over $300; 74% reported an average fee between $300 and $500.</textblock>
    <textblock>126</textblock>
    <textblock>Sixty-two percent of the PAA Survey respondents further reported that the highest fee charged was over $500; 35% said that the largest fee was over $700.</textblock>
    <textblock>127</textblock>
    <textblock>A ``handling fee'' of $500 was nearly equal to the average wholesale cost of a casket in 1988 ($517) and 60% of the average casket mark-up in that year ($821).</textblock>
    <textblock>128</textblock>
    <textblock>Wendell Hahn of the FFDA, which provides financial advising services to 1,500 providers in 30 states, testified that handling fees are assessed because providers, who typically charge professional service fees ``hundreds of dollars'' below their true operation cost, will try to recoup those costs that are lost by the third-party casket sale. Mr. Hahn concluded that handling fees are thus roughly equal to the amount that providers' non-declinable service fees are underpriced.</textblock>

    <textblock>Several local surveys conducted by individual casket retailers provided further evidence on the range of ``casket handling fees'' in given market areas. Those surveys found that handling fees ranged from $100 to $700 in Chicago; DeSoto, R-B-42; and Hennessy, HX-61 at 8; from $150 to $1000 in Greater Pittsburgh; Neel, HX-25, Exhibit 2 at 1; and from $100 to $800 in Detroit, Michigan; Teck, HX-58, Exhibit A. Wendell Hahn of the FFDA reported six instances among a sampling of funeral home records he reviewed for the month of August 1988 where handling fees ranging from $75 to $480 were disclosed on providers' GPLs. HX-49 at 5, Tr. Vol. II, 673, 719-720. Other witnesses, including two funeral directors, testified to the existence of handling fees ranging from $425 to $2,500. See Showalter, Tr.
