    <textblock>Current FDPIR regulations do not clearly state that non-Native</textblock>
    <textblock>American households living on the reservation who meet the</textblock>
    <textblock>program means test are eligible to receive program benefits,</textblock>
    <textblock>although this has always been the policy under which FDPIR has</textblock>
    <textblock>operated on all participating reservations. While the 1987</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed rule did not specifically address this issue, this</textblock>
    <textblock>interim rule does so in order to formalize and clarify what has</textblock>
    <textblock>always been household eligibility policy and practice.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, §253.6(b)(1) is revised to clarify that all</textblock>
    <textblock>households living on the reservation, and meeting the program</textblock>
    <textblock>means test, are eligible to receive program benefits, even if</textblock>
    <textblock>they do not contain a Native American.</textblock>
    <textblock>The 1987 proposed rule did not specifically propose to remove the</textblock>
    <textblock>FDPIR requirement that households living in a near area must</textblock>
    <textblock>include an adult Native American in order to be eligible for</textblock>
    <textblock>participation in FDPIR. However, in the preamble, the Department</textblock>
    <textblock>indicated that this suggestion had been made, summarized the</textblock>
    <textblock>reason for such a change, and solicited comments to determine how</textblock>
    <textblock>extensive this problem is and whether others believe that a</textblock>
    <textblock>change in the definition is necessary. Nineteen of the 20</textblock>
    <textblock>comments received in response to this solicitation supported</textblock>
    <textblock>removal of the requirement. Accordingly, the definition of</textblock>
    <textblock>``Indian tribal household'' in FDPIR at 7 CFR 253.2(c) in the</textblock>
    <textblock>interim rule reads as follows: ``a household in which at least</textblock>
    <textblock>one household member is recognized as a tribal member by any</textblock>
    <textblock>Indian tribe, as defined in this part.'' This same amendment is</textblock>
    <textblock>also made to the definition of ``Indian tribal household'' at 7 CFR</textblock>
    <textblock>254.2(d). Since the requirement that the household include an</textblock>
    <textblock>adult Native American in order to be eligible also exists in</textblock>
    <textblock>FDPIHO, the change will have the same remedial effect in this</textblock>
    <textblock>program.</textblock>
