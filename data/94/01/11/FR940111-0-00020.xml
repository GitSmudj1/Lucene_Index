    <textblock>The proposed rule would allow a motion to reopen a case denied for lack of initial evidence, but would preclude a subsequent administrative appeal. One commenter suggested that an appeal should be allowed. However, since the issue is simply whether a stipulated document was or was not submitted, the avenue of a motion is a sufficient safeguard.</textblock>
    <textblock>Several commenters asked that the proposed rule allowing 30 days to file a motion to reopen or a motion to reconsider be extended to 60 days to give applicants and petitioners time to retain legal counsel and file a response. However, the 30-day period provided is equivalent to that for filing an appeal, which itself was extended several years ago, and thus will not be changed.</textblock>
    <textblock>One commenter suggested that the proposed rule set the level of proof too high for motions to reopen. The provision has accordingly been revised to clarify the facts that must be demonstrated in the motion. Another commenter asked that the Service use this rulemaking to make all decisions of the Board of Immigration Appeals available to the public. The concern will be referred to the Executive Office of Immigration Review for future consideration.</textblock>
    <textblock>Change of Status, Extension of Stay and Use of Form I-94</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed rule provided that where a person demonstrated eligibility for an extension or change of status, the application could be approved at the discretion of the Service. One commenter asserted that discretion should not enter into the decision. However, sections 214 and 248 of the Immigration and Nationality Act give the Service discretionary authority to approve or deny applications for extension or change of status. In addition, a decision on this type of application, and on most other types of applications and petitions, is rarely a simple matter. An alien is not automatically entitled to these types of benefits. The decision to grant a change of status or extension of stay involves weighing various factors, and a judgement by the deciding official of whether to grant the benefit.</textblock>
    <textblock>In response to a number of comments, this rule allows a worker's dependents to be included in a company's petition where there is only one worker in the petition. This provision will go into effect at the time the form providing for this process becomes available.</textblock>
    <textblock>A person was previously required to submit his or her original Form I-94, Nonimmigrant Arrival-Departure Record, with an application to extend or change nonimmigrant status so the Service could annotate the Form I-94 with its decision on the application. The rule proposed altering this process in certain cases to permit the filing of a copy of the Form I-94. The notice of decision would serve as evidence of any decision and alteration to the terms of the person's status.</textblock>
    <textblock>Several commenters supported this idea, suggesting it will eliminate problems with aliens not having evidence of status while their application is pending, and that it will streamline filing. In fact, several asked why it was not being extended to all such applications. However, several others opposed it, arguing that the change would create yet another document employers would have to deal with, further confusing them as to who is authorized to work.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Service is moving to limit to two the number of INS documents employers are required to examine when a person applies for employment: (a) Form I-551, Alien Registration Card, issued to permanent residents; and (b) Form I-688B, Employment Authorization Document, also called an EAD, issued to persons who can accept employment in the open labor market.</textblock>
    <textblock>However, after determining that an alien is not otherwise authorized to work, an employer may file a petition to temporarily employ him or her as a nonimmigrant. If the Service approves the petition, we notify the employer. If the alien is not first required to be admitted in the status, and the Service's approval authorizes immediate employment, we include this in the notice. The approval of such a petition does not authorize the alien to work elsewhere, but only for the employer under the terms and conditions of the approved petition. An EAD is not necessary in such a context since the employer has already determined the alien cannot work unless we approve its petition.</textblock>
    <textblock>Previously when sending a notice that we had approved such a petition we also made a handwritten notation on the alien's Form I-94. The computer system we are installing to improve service will allow us to replace such handwritten notes with a computer generated notice that can be confirmed by the system. Therefore, the rulemaking proposed simplifying filing requirements and allowing aliens to keep their existing Form I-94 as evidence of their status while their new application is pending.</textblock>
    <textblock>To eliminate any confusion, we are revising our approval notice to the employer to include a replacement Form I-94 that the employer can review and then give to the employee. In the interim the original Form I-94 must be filed with the petition for annotation. The Service will publish a notice in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>when the revised approval notice is implemented, at which time only a copy of the individual's I-94 will be required.</textblock>
    <textblock>Reentry permits, refugee travel documents and advance paroles</textblock>
    <textblock>Several commenters stated that applicants for asylum should be eligible for a refugee travel document. However, an applicant for asylum is an applicant for a benefit, and does not acquire any status or travel authorization merely as a result of having submitted the asylum application. It would be inappropriate to grant a travel document until a decision is made that the person is eligible for asylum. If an asylum applicant chooses to leave the United States, he or she may apply abroad for refugee status to reenter.</textblock>
    <textblock>A commenter requested clarification that a refugee travel document may be accepted in lieu of a passport as well as a visa. The final rule clearly refers to the document as a travel document issued pursuant to article 28 of the United Nations Convention of July 28, 1951 for the purpose of travel.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Service received many comments regarding advance parole. Although this subject needs to be addressed, the Service has decided to defer this action to a separate rulemaking.</textblock>
