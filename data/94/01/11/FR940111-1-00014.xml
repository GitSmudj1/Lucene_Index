    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary Espy announced in late May 1993 that he was requesting the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) to present him with a plan for making the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) system of process control mandatory in all the Nation's federally inspected meat and poultry establishments. At the Secretary's direction to ensure greater input from all constituent and other interests, it was determined by FSIS that it would be beneficial to provide all constituent groups with a forum to comment on development of a mandatory HACCP system. Therefore, FSIS announces that a HACCP Round Table discussion will be held.</textblock>
    <textblock>This notice outlines the Round Table process and solicits participation in the Round Table from the constituent groups identified below in the</textblock>
    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</textblock>
    <textblock>. Furthermore, this notice offers the opportunity for persons who believe that an affected interest is not represented below to request participation at the Round Table.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>FSIS views this Round Table as an opportunity to allow free and frank discussion of the legitimate concerns of all constituents prior to the issuance of a proposed regulation on HACCP. This meeting is envisioned as a substantive opportunity to assist FSIS through a thorough discussion of the issues regarding HACCP. This will aid FSIS when it begins drafting the rule for implementing a HACCP system of production in all meat and poultry establishments.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Round Table will be facilitated by a neutral third party. The facilitator will seek the full participation of all Round Table participants, will ensure that all identified issues are addressed by the Round Table participants, and will invite comments at the end of the Round Table. After the Round Table meeting, the facilitator will provide a transcript of the meeting, and will prepare a final report, which will include any comments submitted at the Round Table meeting and will summarize the positions of all Round Table participants.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Round Table meeting will be open to the public. Issue papers will be prepared in advance of the meeting by the participants, and will be publicly available through the FSIS hearing clerk. All issues relative to a HACCP system shall be open for consideration.</textblock>
    <textblock>FSIS has preliminarily identified the following categories of constituents:</textblock>
    <textblock>•Meat and Poultry Industry and Their Representatives (Including Grocers and Retailers)</textblock>
    <textblock>•Consumers and Their Representatives</textblock>
    <textblock>•Scientists and Professional Scientific Organizations</textblock>
    <textblock>•Producers and Farmers</textblock>
    <textblock>•FSIS Employees and Their Representatives</textblock>
    <textblock>•Federal, State, and Local Governments</textblock>
    <textblock>•Public Health Officials and Medical Doctors</textblock>
    <textblock>Any individual or organization that is interested in participating in the Round Table must communicate that interest, and identify his or her constituent category, to Mr. Mark Manis whose address and phone number appear in this notice in the paragraph entitled</textblock>
    <textblock>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</textblock>
    <textblock>, within 2 weeks of the date of the publication of this notice in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. After the 2-week notification period, FSIS will: (1) Compile a list, for each category, of those who expressed an interest in participating in the Round Table meeting; and (2) share that list, by category, with the members of each category. FSIS will then request, within 2 weeks after sending the list to members of each category, that the members of each category select representatives to serve as both Round Table and Steering Committee participants.</textblock>
    <textblock>To ensure the effectiveness of this process, the estimated number of Round Table participants will be between 25 and 30, and the total number of attendees will be determined by the capacity of the meeting room. FSIS will request each constituent category to appoint one representative to serve on the Steering Committee. FSIS will request that five representatives be appointed for the Round Table by each of the following constituent categories: Meat and Poultry Industry and Their Representatives; Consumers and Their Representatives; and Scientists and Professional Scientific Organizations. FSIS will request that four representatives be appointed for the Round Table from the Producers and Farmers category. FSIS will request that three representatives be appointed for the Round Table from the FSIS Employees and Their Representatives; and Federal, State, and Local Governments categories. FSIS will request that two representatives be appointed for the Round Table from the Public Health Officials and Medical Doctors category.</textblock>
    <textblock>If any constituent category is unable to designate its representatives, USDA will assist in the selection.</textblock>
    <textblock>Furthermore, any person who believes that an affected interest is not represented by the identified categories of constituent groups may request, within 2 weeks of the date of publication of this notice in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>, Round Table participation for that affected interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>Once the representatives are appointed, FSIS will convene a Steering Committee to be held in the Washington, DC, area in advance of the Round Table meeting. The Steering Committee will address all relevant pre-meeting issues and determine the: (1) Round Table issues; (2) process for developing issue papers prior to the Round Table; (3) timeframes; (4) meeting schedule; (5) Round Table discussion rules; and (6) any other matter which would assist in an effective and full discussion.</textblock>
