    <textblock>The NFDA, the largest association of funeral industry firms, was the major proponent of repeal,</textblock>
    <textblock>asserting that repeal is warranted because the Rule has imposed significant costs but failed to provide its promised benefits of increased competition and altered patterns of consumer behavior. According to the NFDA, the evidence shows that consumers in selecting funeral providers and types of funeral service still place a higher importance on social, moral and practical factors (such as provider reputation and quality of service) than they do on price.</textblock>
    <textblock>The NFDA concluded that the evidence logically demonstrates that consumers under the Rule spend no less for funeral arrangements, comparison shop no more, and purchase no fewer items and no different types of service than they did before the Rule. The NFDA asserted that the Rule has imposed various monetary costs on providers that have been passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices, as well as non-monetary costs that interfere with providers' ability to give caring, quality service. The NFDA thus concluded that the Rule should be repealed in its entirety because its costs outweigh its benefits.</textblock>
    <textblock>In contrast to the NFDA's view, the AARP provided the most vigorous support for retention of the Rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The AARP advocated that a decision to repeal the Rule must be founded on substantial evidence demonstrating that: (1) The acts and practices addressed by the Rule are no longer prevalent; (2) the harm resulting from those practices has been removed; (3) repeal would not permit the return of that harm; and (4) the benefits of repeal exceed the costs of continuing the Rule. According to the AARP, those questions cannot be answered, and the Rule's full impact cannot be assessed, because the record evidence reveals unacceptably low levels of industry compliance and consumer awareness of the Rule's provisions. Because the Rule's full impact cannot be gauged, the AARP concluded, repeal is unwarranted. The AARP further asserted that the evidence indicates that the Rule has not increased funeral providers' costs, funeral prices, or consumer expenditures, but has begun to provide a variety of consumer benefits. The AARP thus further concluded that, although the Commission need not meet a specific evidentiary burden to retain the Rule, such evidence exists to support the conclusion that the Rule's benefits exceed its costs.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Costs and Benefits Compared</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission has concluded, based on its review of the rulemaking record viewed as a whole, that the Rule warrants retention because its actual and potential benefits to consumers outweigh its costs to providers, and that those benefits are likely to increase over time as the Rule continues to operate. The Commission finds that, at the time of this review:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The Rule has not been effective in the funeral market for a sufficient period to permit a full assessment of its benefits;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The market is increasingly price-sensitive for the selection of funeral providers, types of service, and individual goods and services, particularly caskets, when price and options information is readily available during the selection process;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Despite a documented, low overall compliance level, pro-competitive and informational benefits attributable in part to the Rule appear to be manifesting in the market and are likely to increase over time;</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) The Rule overall imposes minimal compliance burdens on providers that do not significantly raise their business costs or prices, or reduce consumers' satisfaction with the funeral services they receive; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Most states have not adopted laws similar to the Rule in scope and coverage, and such action is not likely in the near future.</textblock>
    <textblock>a. Levels of compliance/price competition/consumer Awareness.</textblock>
    <textblock>The evidence in the record indicates, at the time of this review, a low level of industry compliance with the Rule. Systematic, empirical data from two independent surveys_the Commission-sponsored, 1987 Replication Study and the 1988 Gallup Study conducted for the AARP_show that 36% of funeral providers simultaneously complied with the Rule's two key requirements to give consumers a general price list (``GPL'') and an itemized final statement of goods and services selected.</textblock>
    <textblock>Using the more comprehensive Replication Study results, that overall compliance level dropped to 31% when misrepresentation provisions about the necessity for embalming and caskets for cremation are added to the analysis,</textblock>
    <textblock>and to 9% when the GPL timing requirement is viewed strictly and several other Rule provisions are considered.</textblock>
    <textblock>Most rulemaking participants opined, when asked, that a 30% level of compliance would be insufficient to assess adequately the Rule's benefits.</textblock>

  <footnote>
    <textblock>One issue raised during the proceedings was whether individual members of the NFDA or other trade groups agree that the Rule warrants repeal. Several surveys and other evidence introduced into the record indicated that many funeral directors may not wholly agree with the NFDA view. See, e.g., HX-32 (American Funeral Director magazine survey asked its funeral director readers ``How would you recommend that the NFDA deal with the Funeral Rule during the forthcoming Review?'' 70% responded that the Rule should be accepted as is or partially modified, 12% suggested substantial modification, and 20% repeal; 88% of firms represented by respondent funeral directors were NFDA members); See also, Hocker, President, NFDA, Tr. Vol. III, 1400 (many funeral directors say they are not overly burdened by the Rule); Hunter, President, NSM, Tr. Vol. I, 790-791 (majority of NSM members do not advocate repeal; parts of it have been very helpful); Ayers, HX-108 at 3 (68% of 500 funeral directors surveyed agreed that the Rule's required information was beneficial to consumers).</textblock>

    <textblock>However, the NFDA suggested that price plays a greater role in consumers' selections of individual items involved in the funeral, such as caskets and outer burial containers. R-M-9 at 20.</textblock>

Looking at these obligations individually, 23% of RS providers gave consumers the GPL_the key price disclosure document required by the Rule_at the outset of arrangements discussions as required, and 62% gave consumers who purchased a funeral on an item-by-item basis a properly itemized final statement.

    <textblock>R-M-5 (Staff Rebuttal) at 27, Table 8; R-B-2 (Replication Study/Market Facts Report) data tapes. In the BE analysis (HX-122), RS respondents were considered to have been the beneficiaries of ``compliance'' with respect to receipt of the GPL if they reported its receipt after discussions had begun but before selection of a casket or other container. BE staff, at the rulemaking staff's request, re-computed the compliance index using the Rule's definition of when a GPL must be given to consumers _``upon beginning discussion either of funeral arrangements or of the selection of any funeral goods or funeral services.'' The result was that compliance with four of the Rule's provisions fell from 31% to 15% (timely receipt of the GPL and a properly-itemized statement, and no misrepresentations about the necessity for embalming and caskets for cremation). Overall, simultaneous compliance continued to drop from a ``high'' of 29% (using the most stringent BE compliance index, which added receipt of the GPL ``in writing'' to the four requirements stated above) to a ``low'' of 9% as other Rule provisions were added to the analysis.</textblock>
