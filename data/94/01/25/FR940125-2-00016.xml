    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>A notice of Proposed Withdrawal was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on February 27, 1992 (57 FR 6736), and corrected on April 7, 1992 (57 FR 11797), which segregated the land described therein for up to 2 years from location and entry under the general land laws, including the mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, but not from mineral leasing. The 2-year segregation expires February 26, 1994. The withdrawal application will continue to be processed unless it is canceled or denied. The land is described as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Mount Diablo Meridian</textblock>
    <textblock>T. 4 N., R. 25 E.,</textblock>
    <textblock>Sec. 26, W1/2SW1/4SW1/4;</textblock>
    <textblock>Sec. 27, E1/2SE1/4NE1/4SE1/4, SE1/4SE1/4;</textblock>

    <textblock>Sec. 35, W1/2NW1/4NW1/4.</textblock>
    <textblock>The area described contains 110.00 acres in Mono County.</textblock>
    <textblock>At 10 a.m. on February 27, 1994, the land will be opened to location and entry under the United States general land laws, including the mining laws, subject to valid existing rights, the provisions of existing withdrawals, and other segregations of record. Appropriation of any of the land described in this order under the general mining laws prior to the date and time of restoration is unauthorized. Any such attempted appropriation, including attempted adverse possession under 30 U.S.C. 38 (1988), shall vest no rights against the United States. Acts required to establish a location and to initiate a right of possession are governed by State law where not in conflict with Federal law. The Bureau of Land Management will not intervene in disputes between rival locators over possessory rights since Congress has provided for such determinations in local courts.</textblock>
