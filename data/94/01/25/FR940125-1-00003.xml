    <textblock>This airplane model is manufactured in the United Kingdom and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. Pursuant to this bilateral airworthiness agreement, the CAA has kept the FAA informed of the situation described above. The FAA has examined the findings of the CAA, reviewed all available information, and determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated for operation in the United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would require a visual inspection of an area beneath the flooring for foreign objects and debris, removal of any foreign object or debris found, and installation of a protective guard on the rear cabin attendant seat. The proposed AD would also require a revision to the FAA-approved maintenance program to include repetitive visual inspections of the area above the protective guard for foreign objects and debris, and removal of any foreign object or debris found. The actions would be required to be accomplished in accordance with the alert service bulletin described previously.</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA estimates that 7 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected by this proposed AD, that it would take approximately 2 work hours per airplane to accomplish the proposed actions, and that the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts would be supplied by the manfacturer at no cost to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $770, or $110 per airplane. This total cost figure assumes that no operator has yet accomplished the proposed requirements of this AD action.</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action is contained in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ``ADDRESSES</textblock>

    <textblock>The Proposed Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:</textblock>

    <textblock>Docket 93-NM-200-AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability:</textblock>
    <textblock>Model 4101 airplanes; constructors numbers 41004 through 41023 inclusive; certificated in any category.</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance:</textblock>
    <textblock>Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.</textblock>
    <textblock>To prevent jamming of the elevator and rudder trim systems, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, accomplish paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this AD in accordance with Jetstream Series 4100 Alert Service Bulletin J41-A25-034, Revision 1, dated October 30, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Perform a visual inspection of the underfloor area for foreign objects and debris in accordance with the alert service bulletin. Prior to further flight, remove any foreign object or debris found during the inspection.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Install a protective guard on the rear cabin attendant seat in accordance with the alert service bulletin.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, revise the FAA-approved maintenance program to require repetitive visual inspections of the area above the protective guard for foreign objects and debris, and removal of any foreign object or debris found, in accordance with the times and procedures specified in paragraph 2.C.(7) of Jetstream Series 4100 Alert Service Bulletin J41-A25-034, Revision 1, dated October 30, 1993, as applicable.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch,</textblock>
    <textblock>ANM-113.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note:</textblock>
    <textblock>Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM-113.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.</textblock>
