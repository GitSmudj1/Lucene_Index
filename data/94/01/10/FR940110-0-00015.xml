    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of Agriculture (Department) is adopting as a final rule, without change, the provisions of an interim final rule that authorizes the use of smaller sized olives in the production of limited use styles for California olives. This rule is effective during the 1993-94 crop year and establishes minimum grade and size requirements for such olives in the order's rules and regulations. This final rule also adopts, without change, the provisions of an interim final rule that authorizes the importation of certain bulk olives into the United States to be used in the production of limited use styles of olives such as wedges, halves, slices, or segments. This action is intended to allow more olives into fresh market channels and is consistent with current market requirements. This action also updates the Federal-State inspection office address list contained in the import regulation.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule is issued under Marketing Agreement and Order No. 932 (7 CFR part 932), as amended, regulating the handling of olives grown in California, hereinafter referred to as the order. The order is effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule is also issued under section 8e of the Act, which requires the Secretary of Agriculture to issue grade, size, quality, or maturity requirements for certain listed commodities imported into the United States that are the same as, or comparable to, those imposed upon the domestic commodities under the Federal marketing orders.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule would not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.</textblock>
    <textblock>There are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of import regulations issued under section 8e of the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this action on small entities.</textblock>
