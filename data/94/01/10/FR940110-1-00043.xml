    <textblock>Technical Changes</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed regulation also contains some minor technical changes resulting from the merger of Form I-751 and Form I-752 into the new Form I-751 (see 56 FR 55931 on October 30, 1991; 57 FR 6181 on February 21, 1992). This regulation eliminates reference to the Form I-752, which has been cancelled.</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that this rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Insofar as this proposed rule merely sets forth the procedures for terminating the conditional resident status of alien entrepreneurs already present in the country and for removing the conditional basis of permanent resident status for such persons, any impact the proposed rule will have on small business entities will be, at most, indirect or attenuated. This rule is not significant within the meaning of section 3(f) of E.O. 12866, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with E.O. 12612.</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule contains information collection requirements which have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The OMB control numbers for these collections are contained in 8 CFR 299.5. This rule also contains a new collection requirement which has been forwarded to OMB under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act for review and clearance.</textblock>
