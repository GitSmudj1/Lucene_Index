    <textblock>Carnegie states that it is filing the above tariff sheet as a limited application under section 4 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Order No. 636 to direct bill to Carnegie's former bundled firm sales customer the pre-restructuring balance of Account No. 858 costs included in Carnegie's Account No. 186.7, as adjusted for carrying charges and interest, together with amounts direct billed to Carnegie by Carnegie's upstream pipeline, Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (Texas Eastern), pursuant to Texas Eastern's filing in Docket No. RP93-204-000.</textblock>
    <textblock>Carnegie states that copies of its filing were served on all jurisdictional customers and interested state commissions.</textblock>

All such motions or protests should be filed on or before January 11, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.</textblock>
