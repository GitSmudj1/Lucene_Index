    <textblock>January 4, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Take notice that on December 30, 1993, Transwestern Pipeline Company (Transwestern) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheet, to be effective February 1, 1994:</textblock>
    <textblock>1st Revised Sheet No. 148</textblock>
    <textblock>Transwestern states that the tariff sheet revises Transportation Service Agreement_Form N, Operator Balancing Agreement, Sheet No. 148 in order to revise the Index Price contained therein. The revised Index Price (i) will be based on three geographic locations, rather than one, and (ii) will reflect the average of the daily prices for such locations as quoted in Gas Daily for the applicable month, rather than a price based on a price quoted in the first publication of Gas Daily in a particular month.</textblock>
    <textblock>Transwestern states that copies of the filing were served on its gas utility customers, interested state commissions, and all parties to this proceeding.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions or protests should be filed on or before January 11, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.</textblock>
