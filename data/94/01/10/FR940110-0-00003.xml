    <textblock>2. Define Flavor Characteristics</textblock>
    <textblock>Production and processing practices influence flavor</textblock>
    <textblock>characteristics in whipped butter. To manufacture whipped butter</textblock>
    <textblock>with a highly pleasing flavor, the raw milk and cream must be</textblock>
    <textblock>free of objectionable flavors. This final rule defines</textblock>
    <textblock>acceptable flavor characteristics to assist the graders in</textblock>
    <textblock>identifying and classifying the flavor.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Define Body, Color, and Salt Characteristics and</textblock>
    <textblock>Establish Disratings</textblock>
    <textblock>Just as production and processing practices influence the</textblock>
    <textblock>flavor of whipped butter, they also influence body, color, and</textblock>
    <textblock>salt characteristics. This final rule describes distinguishing</textblock>
    <textblock>body, color, and salt characteristics and establishes disratings</textblock>
    <textblock>which are used to determine the U.S. grade.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Illustrate How Flavor, Body, Color, and Salt</textblock>
    <textblock>Characteristics Influence Grade Determination</textblock>
    <textblock>These standards provide step-by-step instructions in</textblock>
    <textblock>determining the final grade of whipped butter. The U.S. grade of</textblock>
    <textblock>whipped butter is determined on the basis of classifying first</textblock>
    <textblock>the flavor characteristics. Then body, color, and salt</textblock>
    <textblock>characteristics are noted and disratings established. When total</textblock>
    <textblock>disratings exceed the permitted amount identified in the</textblock>
    <textblock>standards, the final U.S. grade is lowered.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Establish Optional Microbiological and Keeping-Quality</textblock>
    <textblock>Tests (Not Mandatory for Grade Designation)</textblock>
    <textblock>Since 1975, the General Specifications for Dairy Plants</textblock>
    <textblock>Approved for USDA Inspection and Grading Service have required</textblock>
    <textblock>microbiological and keeping-quality testing of whipped butter</textblock>
    <textblock>bearing USDA official identification. The market analysis</textblock>
    <textblock>conducted during the development of these standards revealed that</textblock>
    <textblock>the industry utilized tighter microbiological specifications for</textblock>
    <textblock>proteolytic and yeast and mold counts than those listed in the</textblock>
    <textblock>``General Specifications''. To be more aligned with current</textblock>
    <textblock>industry standards, this final rule tightens these</textblock>
    <textblock>microbiological requirements. This final rule also incorporates</textblock>
    <textblock>these same tests as optional tests (not mandatory for grade</textblock>
    <textblock>designation) in the United States Standards for Grades of Whipped</textblock>
    <textblock>Butter.</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule also makes corollary changes in the General</textblock>
    <textblock>Specifications for Dairy Plants Approved for USDA Inspection and</textblock>
    <textblock>Grading Service (subpart B of 7 CFR part 58) to conform the</textblock>
    <textblock>definition and grade designations of whipped butter set forth</textblock>
    <textblock>therein with the new United States Standards for Grades of</textblock>
    <textblock>Whipped Butter (in subpart G of 7 CFR part 58).</textblock>
    <textblock>USDA grade standards are voluntary standards that are</textblock>
    <textblock>developed pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946</textblock>
    <textblock>(7 U.S.C. 1621</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq</textblock>
    <textblock>.) to facilitate the marketing process.</textblock>
    <textblock>Manufacturers of dairy products are free to choose whether or not</textblock>
    <textblock>to use these grade standards. USDA grade standards for dairy</textblock>
    <textblock>products have been developed to identify the degree of quality in</textblock>
    <textblock>the various products. Quality in general refers to usefulness,</textblock>
    <textblock>desirability, and value of the product_its marketability as a</textblock>
    <textblock>commodity. When whipped butter is officially graded, the USDA</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations and standards governing the grading of manufactured</textblock>
    <textblock>or processed dairy products are used. These regulations also</textblock>
    <textblock>require a charge for the grading service provided by USDA. This</textblock>
    <textblock>action makes minor format changes for purposes of clarity to</textblock>
    <textblock>Tables I and III to the format that appeared in the proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>Public Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>On June 30, 1993, the Department published a proposed rule</textblock>
    <textblock>(58 FR 34937) to promulgate the United States Standards for</textblock>
    <textblock>Whipped Butter. The public comment period closed August 30,</textblock>
    <textblock>1993. No comments were received during this time.</textblock>
