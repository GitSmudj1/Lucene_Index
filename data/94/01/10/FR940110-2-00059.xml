In addition to information specified on FCC Form 704, applicants may be required to file other information. Information is used by FCC staff to determine whether an entity seeking control of an existing permittee or licensee is legally and financially qualified to become a common carrier or noncommon carrier telecommunications licensee. If the information is not submitted the above determination required by the Communications Act could not be made. The FCC Form 704 has been revised to incorporate a certification pursuant to rules implementing the provisions of section 5301 of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.</textblock>
