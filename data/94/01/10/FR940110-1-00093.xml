    <textblock>Long-term requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>Rental housing units.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) At least 20 percent of the</textblock>
    <textblock>rental housing units in a project financed under the AHP with</textblock>
    <textblock>subsidized advances or direct subsidies shall remain affordable</textblock>
    <textblock>for and occupied by very low-income households for a minimum</textblock>
    <textblock>period of 30 years or, at the election of the sponsor, the</textblock>
    <textblock>remaining useful life of such units, except as provided in</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph (a)(3) of this section. An applicant and the project</textblock>
    <textblock>sponsor shall state in the AHP application their commitment</textblock>
    <textblock>regarding satisfaction of the long-term income-eligibility,</textblock>
    <textblock>affordability and income-targeting requirements contained in this</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph (a)(1). An applicant may commit to maintain additional</textblock>
    <textblock>units as affordable for and occupied by low- or moderate-income</textblock>
    <textblock>households, which commitment shall be for a minimum period of 30</textblock>
    <textblock>years or, at the election of the sponsor, the remaining useful</textblock>
    <textblock>life of such units, except as provided in paragraph (a)(3) of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section. The Bank's AHP implementation plan shall set forth the</textblock>
    <textblock>procedures that the Bank will follow to effectively implement the</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements of this paragraph (a)(1).</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) A household occupying a rental housing unit subject to the</textblock>
    <textblock>income-targeting requirement of paragraph (a)(1) of this section</textblock>
    <textblock>is required to satisfy the income-eligibility requirement of such</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph applicable to such income-targeted unit, as committed to</textblock>
    <textblock>in the AHP application, upon initial occupancy. The household may</textblock>
    <textblock>continue to occupy the income-targeted unit even if its income</textblock>
    <textblock>increases above the income-eligibility requirement for such unit.</textblock>
    <textblock>The unit may continue to count toward meeting the income-targeting</textblock>
    <textblock>requirement committed to in the AHP application, provided the rent</textblock>
    <textblock>charged remains affordable to the household as defined in ยง960.1;</textblock>
    <textblock>however, if the household's income rises above 140 percent of the</textblock>
    <textblock>income-targeting level committed to in the AHP application, the</textblock>
    <textblock>sponsor must make the next available rental housing unit in the</textblock>
    <textblock>project affordable to and available for occupancy by a household</textblock>
    <textblock>whose income is at or below the income-targeting level committed</textblock>
    <textblock>to in the AHP application for the original unit, and once the next</textblock>
    <textblock>available rental housing unit is so occupied, the rent charged on</textblock>
    <textblock>the unit occupied by the household whose income has risen shall no</textblock>
    <textblock>longer be subject to the requirement that it be affordable for</textblock>
    <textblock>households at the income-targeting level committed to in the AHP</textblock>
    <textblock>application.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) An owner of an AHP-assisted rental housing project may sell</textblock>
    <textblock>the project prior to the end of the long-term period during which</textblock>
    <textblock>the project's rental units, or applicable portion thereof, must</textblock>
    <textblock>remain affordable for and occupied by households with incomes at</textblock>
    <textblock>or below the levels committed to in the AHP application; however,</textblock>
    <textblock>either:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) The purchaser must agree to continue the project's</textblock>
    <textblock>rental units, or applicable portion thereof, as affordable for and</textblock>
    <textblock>occupied by households with incomes at or below the levels</textblock>
    <textblock>committed to in the AHP application for the remainder of the</textblock>
    <textblock>long-term period committed to in the AHP application, and must</textblock>
    <textblock>agree to be subject to the same restrictions on resale that</textblock>
    <textblock>applied to the seller; or</textblock>
