    <textblock>Title:</textblock>
    <textblock>Request for Information for the bioremediation Field Initiative Database Systems (EPA ICR No. 1672.01).</textblock>
    <textblock>Abstract:</textblock>
    <textblock>This is a new ICR for gathering information on the design, operation, and performance of biological treatment technologies from remediation experts and managers working at sites where biological treatment technologies are being tested or implemented. The authority for collecting information on innovative treatment technologies is described at Section 311 of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, Section 8003 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Section 7001 of the Oil Pollution Act, and Section 10 of the Toxic Substance Control Act. The information will help the EPA to deploy innovative technologies more quickly at Superfund and other sites.</textblock>
    <textblock>Selected respondents will be asked to complete and return, via mail, a two-part questionnaire. The first part requests general site information, such as location, contacts, contaminants, and legislative authority under which the site is being remediated. The second part requests site-specific biotechnology information, such as the stage of the operation, wastes and media being treated, clean-up level goals, and the performance and cost of the treatment. All responses will be strictly voluntary. Following the initial questionnaire, respondents will receive follow-up questionnaires on a semi-annual basis to update the information already provided.</textblock>
    <textblock>The EPA will enter the information from completed questionnaires into computer databases that will be publicly accessible through computerized bulletin boards.</textblock>
    <textblock>Burden Statement:</textblock>
    <textblock>Public reporting burden for respondents is estimated to average 1.6 hours per response with 5 hours per response for the first-time respondents and 0.5 hours for respondents updating previous responses, including time for reviewing instructions, gathering and compiling the data needed, and completing and reviewing the questionnaire.</textblock>
    <textblock>Respondents:</textblock>
    <textblock>Respondents may be State and local governments, businesses, non-profit institutions, and small businesses and organizations involved in the use of innovative technologies at Superfund or other remediation sites.</textblock>
