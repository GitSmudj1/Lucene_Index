    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Chapter Ten of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) Implementation Act of 1993 requires the United States, Canada, and Mexico to eliminate ``buy national'' restrictions on non-defense related purchases by the federal governments. NAFTA is being implemented in the Federal Acquisition Regulation but also requires revision of the DFARS to integrate Buy American Act and Balance of Payments Program waivers necessitated by NAFTA with similar existing Department of Defense waivers for countries with memoranda of understanding or other international agreements.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The interim rule may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.,</textblock>
    <textblock>because the rule waives the Buy American Act for certain Mexican and Canadian products. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) has been prepared and will be provided to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy for the Small Business Administration. Comments are invited. Comments from small entities concerning the affected DFARS subpart will be considered in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 610. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite DFARS Case 93-610 in correspondence.</textblock>
    <textblock>C. Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The Paperwork Reduction Act applies because the provisions at 252.225-7006, Buy American Act-Trade Agreements-Balance of Payments Program Certificate, and 252.225-7035, Buy American Act-North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act-Balance of Payments Program Certificate, require offerors to list the line item number and country of origin for any end product other than a domestic end product. Accordingly, a request for clearance of a new information collection requirement concerning the North American Free Trade Agreement Act is being submitted to the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>D. Determination To Issue an Interim Rule</textblock>
    <textblock>A determination has been made under the authority of the Secretary of Defense to issue this rule as an interim rule. Urgent and compelling reasons exist to promulgate this rule before affording the public an opportunity to comment. This action is necessary because the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, signed into law on December 8, 1993, becomes effective on January 1, 1994. However, pursuant to Public Law 98-577 and Federal Acquisition Regulation 1.501, public comments received in response to this interim rule will be considered in formulating the final rule.</textblock>
