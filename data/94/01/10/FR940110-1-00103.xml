    <textblock>Calculation of interest rate.</textblock>
    <textblock>When a loan fund or loan</textblock>
    <textblock>consortium receives a grant from an applicant pursuant to the AHP</textblock>
    <textblock>and uses the grant to lower the interest rate on a loan to the</textblock>
    <textblock>borrower, the interest rate calculation must be consistent with</textblock>
    <textblock>the procedure used by the Bank for calculating the amount of AHP</textblock>
    <textblock>subsidy needed for a subsidized advance, taking into account the</textblock>
    <textblock>source of funds used by the loan fund or loan consortium for its</textblock>
    <textblock>loans and the rate that normally would be charged for a loan of</textblock>
    <textblock>the type and term that is provided to the borrower.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Interest or other income earned on loans or grants.</textblock>
    <textblock>If an</textblock>
    <textblock>applicant receives a subsidized advance or direct subsidy from a</textblock>
    <textblock>Bank and in turn provides a loan or grant to a loan fund or loan</textblock>
    <textblock>consortium, any interest or other income earned by the loan fund</textblock>
    <textblock>or loan consortium on such funds, not including any approved fee</textblock>
    <textblock>or interest rate spread charged to the borrower, either:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Must be used by the loan fund or loan consortium to provide</textblock>
    <textblock>funds for additional projects meeting the threshold requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>in §960.9 and the criteria committed to in the approved AHP</textblock>
    <textblock>application; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Must be forwarded to the applicant, which in turn must</textblock>
    <textblock>forward the funds to the Bank to be used for additional AHP</textblock>
    <textblock>projects.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4)</textblock>
    <textblock>Loans or grants from multiple AHP funding cycles.</textblock>
    <textblock>If loans</textblock>
    <textblock>or grants received by a loan fund or loan consortium pursuant to</textblock>
    <textblock>one AHP funding cycle are combined with loans or grants received</textblock>
    <textblock>by such entity pursuant to another AHP funding cycle in a single</textblock>
    <textblock>rental housing project, the loan fund or loan consortium shall</textblock>
    <textblock>require the recipient of the funds to follow the requirements for</textblock>
    <textblock>the use of such funds from the AHP funding cycle that is more</textblock>
    <textblock>restrictive as to the approved AHP criteria. The requirement does</textblock>
    <textblock>not apply when loans or grants received by a loan fund or loan</textblock>
    <textblock>consortium pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles are combined to</textblock>
    <textblock>finance a single owner-occupied housing project; however, the loan</textblock>
    <textblock>fund or loan consortium in its discretion may require the</textblock>
    <textblock>recipient of the funds to follow the requirements for the use of</textblock>
    <textblock>such funds from the AHP funding cycle that is more restrictive as</textblock>
    <textblock>to the approved AHP criteria.</textblock>
    <textblock>(5)</textblock>
    <textblock>Using repayments of loans within reasonable period of time.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any loans provided by a loan fund or loan consortium pursuant to</textblock>
    <textblock>the AHP that are repaid to such entity must be re-lent or provided</textblock>
    <textblock>as grants by such entity within a reasonable period of time after</textblock>
    <textblock>such repayments, or must be repaid to the applicant, which in turn</textblock>
    <textblock>must repay such funds to the Bank, and must be made available by</textblock>
    <textblock>the Bank for additional AHP projects. The Bank shall in its AHP</textblock>
    <textblock>implementation plan identify what constitutes a reasonable period</textblock>
    <textblock>of time for such purposes.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d)</textblock>
    <textblock>Monitoring and reporting</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>General.</textblock>
    <textblock>Where loans or</textblock>
    <textblock>grants are provided by an applicant pursuant to the AHP to a loan</textblock>
    <textblock>fund or loan consortium which uses the funds to finance</textblock>
    <textblock>owner-occupied or rental housing units, the Bank shall:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Monitor such units according to the monitoring requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>of §960.14(e) through (h);</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Require the sponsor or owner of a project receiving loans</textblock>
    <textblock>or grants from the loan fund or loan consortium to submit such</textblock>
    <textblock>reports and certifications to the Bank as are required under</textblock>
    <textblock>§960.15(c); and</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Require the loan fund or loan consortium to report to the</textblock>
    <textblock>Bank any new loan or grant made using the repayments of loans by</textblock>
    <textblock>the borrower. If a loan fund or loan consortium receives loans or</textblock>
    <textblock>grants from an applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles,</textblock>
    <textblock>the use of such funds must be reported separately.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Exceptions.</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) The Bank may contract with the applicant</textblock>
    <textblock>to meet the monitoring requirements of §960.14 (e) through (h), in</textblock>
    <textblock>which case the applicant shall:</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) Monitor the AHP-assisted housing units according to the</textblock>
    <textblock>monitoring requirements of §960.14 (e) through (h);</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) Require the sponsor or owner of the project to submit to</textblock>
    <textblock>the applicant such reports and certifications as are required</textblock>
    <textblock>under §960.15(c); and</textblock>
    <textblock>(C) Require the loan fund or loan consortium to report to the</textblock>
    <textblock>applicant any new loan or grant made using the repayments of loans</textblock>
    <textblock>by the borrower. If a loan fund or loan consortium receives loans</textblock>
    <textblock>or grants from an applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding</textblock>
    <textblock>cycles, the use of such funds must be reported separately.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) The Bank may contract with the loan fund or loan</textblock>
    <textblock>consortium to meet the monitoring requirements of §960.14 (e)</textblock>
    <textblock>through (h), in which case the loan fund or loan consortium shall:</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) Monitor the AHP-assisted housing units according to the</textblock>
    <textblock>monitoring requirements of §960.14 (e) through (h);</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) Require the sponsor or owner of the project to submit to</textblock>
    <textblock>the loan fund or loan consortium such reports and certifications</textblock>
    <textblock>as are required under §960.15(c); and</textblock>
