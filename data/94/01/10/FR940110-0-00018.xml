    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>

    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. The suspension will allow transfers of Class I fluid milk products from a distributing plant to other plants regulated under Order 106 to be counted as part of the distributing plant's route sales for the purpose of determining the plant's pool status under the order. The suspension was requested by Associated Milk Producers, Inc. (AMPI), and Mid-America Dairymen, Inc. (Mid-America), who stated that it was necessary to restore equity among producers supplying handlers regulated under Order 106.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Prior document in this proceeding: Notice of Proposed Suspension: Issued November 23, 1993; published November 30, 1993 (58 FR 63120).</textblock>
    <textblock>The Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that this final rule would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This suspension will lessen the opportunity for disorderly marketing conditions and will tend to ensure that dairy farmers continue to have their milk priced under the order and thereby receive the benefits that accrue from such pricing.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. This rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with the rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.</textblock>
    <textblock>This order of suspension is issued pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act and the rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part 900).</textblock>
