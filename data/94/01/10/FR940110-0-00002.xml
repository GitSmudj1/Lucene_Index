    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule promulgates new United States Standards</textblock>
    <textblock>for Grades of Whipped Butter. These standards establish quality</textblock>
    <textblock>criteria for grade determination and optional microbiological and</textblock>
    <textblock>keeping-quality tests for whipped butter.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department has determined that the grading of butter</textblock>
    <textblock>sold in consumer-size packages bearing USDA official</textblock>
    <textblock>identification (grade-label) should be conducted when the product</textblock>
    <textblock>is in the final package. Previously, the quality of whipped</textblock>
    <textblock>butter was evaluated prior to the whipping process using the U.S.</textblock>
    <textblock>Standards for Grades of Butter. The U.S. Standards for Grades of</textblock>
    <textblock>Whipped Butter change this procedure.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule has been reviewed</textblock>
    <textblock>under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This action</textblock>
    <textblock>is not intended to have retroactive effect. This rule does not</textblock>
    <textblock>preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless</textblock>
    <textblock>they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule. There</textblock>
    <textblock>are no administrative procedures which must be exhausted prior to</textblock>
    <textblock>any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The final rule also has been reviewed in accordance with the</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>The</textblock>
    <textblock>Administrator, Agricultural Marketing Service, has determined</textblock>
    <textblock>that the final rule will not have a significant economic impact</textblock>
    <textblock>on a substantial number of small entities because use of the</textblock>
    <textblock>standards is voluntary and this action will not increase costs to</textblock>
    <textblock>those utilizing the standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>In 1991, the Department evaluated the procedures used to</textblock>
    <textblock>assign U.S. grades to butter in consumer-size packages. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Department concluded that grading of the product should be</textblock>
    <textblock>conducted in the final package because the evaluation of whipped</textblock>
    <textblock>butter at that time is more accurate.</textblock>
    <textblock>Previously, the procedure for evaluating grade-label whipped</textblock>
    <textblock>butter was to either grade the butter in the bulk form prior to</textblock>
    <textblock>whipping or obtain a sample of fresh butter taken during the</textblock>
    <textblock>manufacturing process and evaluate it. These methods are changed</textblock>
    <textblock>by this action because of the Department's decision to conduct</textblock>
    <textblock>grading in the final package. The new standards have received</textblock>
    <textblock>general support from many of the manufacturers of whipped butter</textblock>
    <textblock>who utilize the USDA grade-label program, as well as from the</textblock>
    <textblock>American Butter Institute. In addition, the standards were</textblock>
    <textblock>field-tested by the Dairy Grading Branch and found to be</textblock>
    <textblock>satisfactory.</textblock>
    <textblock>In view of the need for new standards, the Department</textblock>
    <textblock>published on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34937) proposed United States</textblock>
    <textblock>Standards for Whipped Butter. Except for minor format changes,</textblock>
    <textblock>the standards contained in this final rule are the same as those</textblock>
    <textblock>set forth in the proposal. The new standards establish the</textblock>
    <textblock>following.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Provide Quality Specifications for Whipped Butter at Two</textblock>
    <textblock>U.S. Grade Levels: U.S. Grade AA and U.S.</textblock>
    <textblock>Grade A</textblock>
    <textblock>Whipped butter is produced by uniformly incorporating air or</textblock>
    <textblock>inert gas into butter to improve its spreadability</textblock>
    <textblock>characteristics. The percent overrun, based on buyer or consumer</textblock>
    <textblock>preference, is usually between 50 and 100 percent. Market</textblock>
    <textblock>analysis conducted during the development of these standards</textblock>
    <textblock>supports the opinion that consumers prefer the higher quality</textblock>
    <textblock>products. Therefore, standards are established for quality</textblock>
    <textblock>designations at two levels: U.S. Grade AA and U.S.</textblock>
    <textblock>Grade A.</textblock>
