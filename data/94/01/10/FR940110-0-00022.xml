    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>States with final authorization under section 3006(b) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (``RCRA'' or the ``the Act''), 42 U.S.C. 6929(b), have a continuing obligation to maintain a hazardous waste program that is equivalent to, consistent with, and no less stringent than the Federal hazardous waste program.</textblock>
    <textblock>Revisions to State hazardous waste programs are necessary when Federal or State statutory or regulatory authority is modified or when certain other changes occur. Most commonly, State program revisions are necessitated by changes to EPA's regulations in 40 CFR parts 124, 260 through 268 and 270.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. South Dakota</textblock>
    <textblock>South Dakota initially received final authorization in November 1984. Revisions to the program were approved on June 17, 1991, June 29, 1992, and September 8, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA has reviewed South Dakota's application, and has made an immediate final decision that South Dakota's hazardous waste program revision satisfies all of the requirements necessary to qualify for final authorization. Consequently, EPA intends to grant final authorization for the additional program modifications to South Dakota. The public may submit written comments on EPA's immediate final decision up until February 9, 1994. Copies of South Dakota's application for program revision are available for inspection and copying at the locations indicated in the</textblock>
    <textblock>ADDRESSES</textblock>
    <textblock>section of this notice.</textblock>
    <textblock>Approval of South Dakota's program revision shall become effective in 60 days unless an adverse comment pertaining to the State's revision discussed in this notice is received by the end of the comment period. If an adverse comment is received EPA will publish either: (1) A withdrawal of the immediate final decision or (2) a notice containing a response to comments which either affirms that the immediate final decision takes effect or reverses the decision.</textblock>
    <textblock>A draft application was submitted on April 30, 1993. The State of South Dakota addressed all of EPA's concerns prior to submittal of the final application. Thus, the South Dakota program is granted immediate final authorization for the provisions in the following Table.</textblock>
