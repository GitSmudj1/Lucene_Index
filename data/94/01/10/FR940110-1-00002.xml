    <textblock>Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>Information collection requirements contained in the current regulation at 7 CFR part 701 have been approved by the Office of Management and Budget under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB Number 0560-0082.

    <textblock>Executive Order 12866</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule is issued in conformance with Executive Order 12866. Based on information compiled by the Department, it has been determined that this proposed rule:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Would have an annual effect on the economy of less than $100 million;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Would not adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Would not create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Would not alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or rights and obligations of recipients thereof; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Would not raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the Presidents's priorities, or principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.</textblock>

    <textblock>Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>It has been determined that the Regulatory Flexibility Act is not applicable to this rule since ASCS is not required by 5 U.S.C. 553 or any other provision of law to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the subject matter of this rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>Environmental Evaluation</textblock>
    <textblock>It has been determined by an environmental evaluation that this action will have no significant impact on the quality of the human environment, health, and safety. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12372</textblock>
    <textblock>This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at</textblock>
    <textblock>48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12778</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12778. The provisions of this proposed rule are not retroactive and preempt State laws to the extent they are not consistent with the provisions of this proposed rule. Before any judicial action may be brought regarding the provisions of this proposed rule, the administrative appeal provisions of 7 CFR part 780 must be exhausted.</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The ACP is authorized generally by Sections 7-17 of the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act as amended (the Act) (16 U.S.C. 22590g</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>). The program provides financial and technical assistance to encourage agricultural producers to voluntarily perform enduring soil and water conservation, water quality, and pollution abatement measures, including practices or programs which are deemed essential to maintain soil productivity, prevent soil depletion, maintain water quality, or prevent increased cost of production.</textblock>
    <textblock>A WQIP is authorized by the Food, Agriculture, Conservation, and Trade Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. 3831</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>). However, Congress funded WQIP as a part of the ACP. Accordingly, the WQIP is a voluntary incentive program conducted pursuant to the Act to develop and implement</textblock>
    <textblock>agricultural water quality protection plans on up to 10 million acres.</textblock>
