    <textblock>An amended interim final rule was issued for the Papaya Administrative Committee (PAC), on June 14, 1993, and published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>[58 FR 33759, June 21, 1993] effective for the period July 1, 1993, through</textblock>
    <textblock>June 30, 1994, with a 30-day comment period ending July 21, 1993. The interim final rule authorized expenses of $700,580 and an assessment rate of $0.0085 per pound of fresh papayas for the 1993-94 fiscal year. No comments were filed on the expenses and assessment rate in the interim final rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>However, the PAC met again on August 13, 1993, and unanimously recommended decreasing authorized expenses from $700,580 to $597,860, a $102,720 decrease in expenses from the authorized amount. The PAC also unanimously recommended decreasing the assessment rate from $0.0085 to $0.0069, a $0.0016 decrease in the assessment rate, based upon</textblock>
    <textblock>58 million pounds of fresh papayas, from the previously established assessment rate.</textblock>
    <textblock>An amended interim final rule was issued on October 7, 1993, and published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>[58 FR 53117, October 14, 1993] effective for the period July 1, 1993, through June 30, 1994, and provided a 30-day comment period. This amended interim final rule decreased authorized expenses to $597,860, and reduced the assessment rate to $0.0069 per pound of fresh papayas for the 1993-94 fiscal year under the order. Program income for the PAC decreased from $701,660 to $599,356, a $102,304 decrease from the previous estimate. Major program income reductions come from a $92,800 decrease in assessment income due to the lower assessment rate and a $9,504 reduction in income from the Department's Foreign Agricultural Service.</textblock>
    <textblock>The $102,720 decrease in expenses results from reductions in a number of expense items. Major expense reductions include expenditures for salaries and wages, office rent, auto expenses, and Japanese advertising and promotion. The projected income over expenses has increased from $1,080 to $1,496, a $416 increase from the previous amount. The excess funds will be added to the PAC's operational reserve.</textblock>
    <textblock>While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on all handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived from the operation of the marketing orders. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>The amended interim final rules were published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>[58 FR 53111 October 14, 1993], for 7 CFR part 906, and [58 FR 53117, October 14, 1993], for 7 CFR part 928. Each interim final rule provided a 30-day comment period for interested persons. No comments were received.</textblock>
    <textblock>It is found that the specified expenses for the marketing orders covered in this rule are reasonable and likely to be incurred and that such expenses and the specified assessment rates to cover such expenses will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>[5 U.S.C. 553]. The Committees need to have sufficient funds to pay their expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1993-94 fiscal years for the programs began on August 1, 1993, for Texas citrus and July 1, 1993, for Hawaii papayas. The marketing orders require that the rates of assessment for the fiscal year apply to all assessable oranges, grapefruit, and papayas handled during the fiscal years. In addition, handlers are aware of these actions which were recommended by the Committees at public meetings and published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>as interim final rules. No comments were received concerning the two interim final rules that are adopted in this action as final rules without change.</textblock>
