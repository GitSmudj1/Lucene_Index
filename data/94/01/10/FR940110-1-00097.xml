    <textblock>Applications for projects that</textblock>
    <textblock>meet one or more priorities recommended by the Bank's Advisory</textblock>
    <textblock>Council and adopted by the Bank's board of directors that each</textblock>
    <textblock>address a housing need in the Bank's district and are consistent</textblock>
    <textblock>with the purposes of this part. The Bank shall describe in its</textblock>
    <textblock>AHP implementation plan how the points for the priority or</textblock>

    <textblock>Economic mobility priority.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applications for projects that</textblock>
    <textblock>provide housing for low- or moderate-income households that move</textblock>
    <textblock>from low- or moderate-income neighborhoods or housing projects to</textblock>

    <textblock>Targeting_20-point category.</textblock>
    <textblock>An application can receive a</textblock>
    <textblock>maximum of 20 points for this category. The Bank shall award</textblock>
    <textblock>points to applications based on the extent to which the project(s)</textblock>
    <textblock>serve(s) the greatest percentage of very low-, low- and</textblock>
    <textblock>moderate-income households, in that priority order. In the</textblock>
    <textblock>alternative, if a weighted-average scoring methodology is provided</textblock>
    <textblock>in the Bank's AHP implementation plan, the Bank shall award points</textblock>
    <textblock>to an application based on the extent to which the project has the</textblock>
    <textblock>lowest weighted-average income determined by multiplying the</textblock>
    <textblock>percentage of units reserved for households at certain income</textblock>
    <textblock>levels by those incomes expressed as a percentage of median</textblock>
    <textblock>income, and adding the totals. Applications shall be scored</textblock>
    <textblock>relative to each other with the maximum number of points allowable</textblock>
    <textblock>awarded to the application(s) that best achieve(s) the targeting</textblock>
    <textblock>objective, and the remaining application scores shall be adjusted</textblock>
    <textblock>and awarded points on a declining scale basis. However,</textblock>
    <textblock>owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored as one group and</textblock>
    <textblock>rental housing projects shall be scored as a separate group.</textblock>
    <textblock>(f)</textblock>
    <textblock>Other objectives.</textblock>
    <textblock>The five other objectives categories are</textblock>
    <textblock>as set forth in the following paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of</textblock>
    <textblock>this section. The Bank in its AHP implementation plan shall</textblock>
    <textblock>define more specifically each of the five other objectives</textblock>
    <textblock>categories and explain specifically how points will be awarded for</textblock>
    <textblock>satisfying each category. For each category, the Bank shall award</textblock>
    <textblock>the maximum number of points allowable for such category to the</textblock>
    <textblock>application(s) that best achieve(s) the objective, and the</textblock>
    <textblock>remaining application scores shall be adjusted and awarded points</textblock>
    <textblock>on a declining scale basis.</textblock>

    <textblock>An application</textblock>
    <textblock>can receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank</textblock>
    <textblock>shall award points to applications based on the extent to which</textblock>
    <textblock>the project proposes to use the least amount of AHP subsidy per</textblock>
    <textblock>AHP-subsidized unit. Projects should be scored relative to each</textblock>
    <textblock>other; however, owner-occupied housing projects shall be scored as</textblock>
    <textblock>one group and rental housing projects shall be scored as a</textblock>
    <textblock>separate group. This scoring criterion may not include a</textblock>
    <textblock>leveraging criterion whereby the application is scored based on</textblock>
    <textblock>the percentage of the project's total development cost that is to</textblock>
    <textblock>be financed with the AHP subsidy.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicant participation_5-point category.</textblock>
    <textblock>An application</textblock>
    <textblock>can receive a maximum of 5 points for this category. The Bank</textblock>

    <textblock>the project involves participation by applicants other than the</textblock>
    <textblock>receipt of a subsidized advance or direct subsidy under the AHP.</textblock>
    <textblock>Such participation can be financial or non-financial, including</textblock>
    <textblock>but not limited to debt or equity financing of the project, grants</textblock>

    <textblock>there is demonstrated support for the project by local community</textblock>
    <textblock>organizations and individuals other than as project sponsors, such</textblock>
    <textblock>as through the commitment by such organizations and individuals of</textblock>
    <textblock>funds, goods and services, and volunteer labor.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4)</textblock>
    <textblock>Community stability_10-point category.</textblock>
    <textblock>An application can</textblock>
    <textblock>receive a maximum of 10 points for this category. The Bank shall</textblock>
    <textblock>award points to applications based on the extent to which the</textblock>
    <textblock>project(s) maximize(s) community stability, such as by:</textblock>
    <textblock>committing to a greater long-term period pursuant to ยง960.5;</textblock>
    <textblock>revitalizing vacant or abandoned properties or being integrally</textblock>
    <textblock>part of a neighborhood stabilization plan, if such revitalization</textblock>
    <textblock>or stabilization is not identified as a special needs category by</textblock>
    <textblock>the Bank pursuant to ยง960.10(d)(3)(iii); and not displacing low-</textblock>
    <textblock>or moderate-income households, or if such displacement will occur,</textblock>
    <textblock>indicating how such households will be assisted to minimize the</textblock>
    <textblock>impact of such displacement.</textblock>
    <textblock>(5)</textblock>
    <textblock>Innovation_5-point category.</textblock>
    <textblock>An application can receive a</textblock>
    <textblock>maximum of 5 points for this category. The Bank shall award</textblock>
    <textblock>points to applications based on the extent to which the project(s)</textblock>
    <textblock>involve(s) a particularly new or unusual approach, either</textblock>
    <textblock>financial or non-financial, for meeting the requirements of this</textblock>
    <textblock>part.</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง960.11</textblock>
    <textblock>Modifications of approved AHP applications.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) An applicant that seeks a modification of an approved AHP</textblock>
    <textblock>application before completion and occupancy of the project must</textblock>
    <textblock>submit a request for such modification in writing to the Bank for</textblock>
    <textblock>review and approval. A modification is any change that affects or</textblock>
    <textblock>could potentially affect the material facts under which the</textblock>
    <textblock>application was originally evaluated and scored.</textblock>
