    <textblock>C. Effective Date of Section 310(b) Restrictions</textblock>
    <textblock>11. Roamer One appears to object to our statement in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice</textblock>
    <textblock>that ``all reclassifiable private licensees are</textblock>
    <textblock>immediately</textblock>
    <textblock>subject to the foreign ownership restrictions on common carriers by section 310(b).''</textblock>
    <textblock>As noted above, Roamer One contends that, prior to the completion of this rule making proceeding, the Commission should not impose alien ownership restrictions on private radio licensees who are unlikely to be classified as CMRS providers. We agree that the restrictions in section 310(b) would only apply to licensees that are actually reclassified pursuant to the statute and its implementation in this rule making. Section 310(b) does not and will not apply to private land mobile radio licensees who will not be reclassified as CMRS providers. On the other hand, the statute does require immediate enforcement of section 310(b) for private land mobile providers that are reclassified as CMRS. Section 6002(c)(2)(B) of the Budget Act states:</textblock>
    <textblock>[A]ny private land mobile service provided by any person before [the Budget Act's] date of enactment, and any paging service utilizing frequencies allocated as of January 1, 1993, for private land mobile services, shall,</textblock>
    <textblock>except for purposes of section 332(c)(6) of [the Communications Act],</textblock>
    <textblock>be treated as a private mobile service until 3 years after such date of enactment.</textblock>
    <textblock>Budget Act, section 6002(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added). Although other common carrier regulation may not apply to some licensees for 3 years, unless a licensee timely files and is granted a waiver pursuant to section 332(c)(6), section 310(b) will apply immediately upon the effective date of our rules reclassifying the licensee's service as CMRS. Accordingly, as stated above, licensees that may be reclassified should file a timely waiver request to grandfather any foreign ownership or other interest that existed as of May 24, 1993, and that might be affected by the application of section 310(b).</textblock>
    <textblock>V. Petitioning Procedure</textblock>
    <textblock>12. In light of the above, we adopt the following petitioning procedure. First, petitions should be in an informal, letter format, and must contain the caption ``COMMERCIAL MOBILE RADIO SERVICE FOREIGN OWNERSHIP WAIVER PETITION.'' Petitions must clearly specify the licensee's name, radio service, call sign(s), station address(es) or geographical location(s), and contact person with telephone number. Petitions must specifically request a waiver of section 310(b), identify the particular subsection(s) of section 310(b) for which the waiver is requested, and state that the waiver is sought under section 332(c)(6). The original copy of the waiver petition must be signed by the licensee,</textblock>
    <textblock>and this signature will be taken to certify that all statements made in the petition are true, complete, correct, and made in good faith.</textblock>
    <textblock>13. In addition, as proposed in the Notice, petitions must:</textblock>
