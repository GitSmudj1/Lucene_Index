    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The State-Administered Workplace Literacy Program and the National Workplace Literacy Program are important activities that assist in achieving the National Education Goals. Specifically, the workplace literacy programs address Goal 5, that every adult American will be literate and will possess the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in a global economy and exercise the rights and responsibilities of citizenship. Moreover, the National Workplace Literacy Program supports this goal by providing grants to exemplary partnerships between a business, industry, or labor organization, or a private industry council, and an education organization to support work-related literacy education.</textblock>
    <textblock>These regulations increase the accountability of workplace literacy projects. The Department is implementing this strategy in order to expand the demonstration and dissemination activities of projects, thereby increasing the number of instructional approaches, materials, and techniques for providing work-related literacy education that are submitted to and approved by the Department's Program Effectiveness Panel, and subsequently made available to practitioners.</textblock>
