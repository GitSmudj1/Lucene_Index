    <textblock>(iii) Whether there has been a substantial reduction in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Bank's advances outstanding. The Board shall consider the extent</textblock>
    <textblock>to which the Bank's level of advances has declined in any given</textblock>
    <textblock>quarter or year, and whether such decline is projected to</textblock>
    <textblock>continue; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) Whether any other financial condition exists with respect</textblock>
    <textblock>to the Bank which has resulted in, or is likely to result in, the</textblock>
    <textblock>financial instability of the Bank.</textblock>
    <textblock>b.</textblock>
    <textblock>Limitations on grounds for approval of application.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 960.19(b)(2) of the proposed rule provides that the</textblock>
    <textblock>Board shall disapprove an application for a temporary suspension</textblock>
    <textblock>if it determines that the Bank's reduction in earnings is a result</textblock>
    <textblock>of:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) A change in the terms of advances (other than subsidized</textblock>
    <textblock>advances) to members which is not justified by market conditions;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Inordinate operating and administrative expenses; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Mismanagement.</textblock>
    <textblock>The ``reduction in earnings'' language replaces the term</textblock>
    <textblock>``financial instability'' used in the Board's existing regulation,</textblock>
    <textblock>because the former is the term used in the Act. See 12 CFR</textblock>
    <textblock>960.11(c); 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6).</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, the requirement in ยง960.11(c)(5) of the Board's</textblock>
    <textblock>existing regulation that the Bank shall disapprove an application</textblock>
    <textblock>if for any other reason the temporary suspension is not warranted,</textblock>
    <textblock>is deleted in the proposed rule because it is not required by the</textblock>
    <textblock>Act, and limits the Board's discretion to balance reasons</textblock>
    <textblock>warranting approval of an application for a temporary suspension.</textblock>
    <textblock>See 12 CFR 960.11(c)(5); 12 U.S.C. 1430(j)(6).</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Board Decision</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 960.19(c) of the proposed rule provides that the Board</textblock>
    <textblock>shall approve or disapprove a Bank's application for a temporary</textblock>
    <textblock>suspension within 30 calendar days of receipt of such application,</textblock>
    <textblock>and the Board's decision shall be in writing and shall be</textblock>
    <textblock>accompanied by specific findings and reasons for its action. A</textblock>
    <textblock>copy of the Board's decision shall be forwarded to each of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Banks.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Board Approval of Application for Temporary Suspension</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 960.19(d)(1) of the proposed rule provides that if the</textblock>
    <textblock>Board approves a Bank's application for a temporary suspension,</textblock>
    <textblock>the Board's written decision shall specify the period of time such</textblock>
    <textblock>suspension shall remain in effect.</textblock>
