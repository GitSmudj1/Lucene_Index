    <textblock>Under §960.17(d)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule, if the Bank</textblock>
    <textblock>contracts with the loan fund or loan consortium to meet the</textblock>
    <textblock>monitoring requirements in §960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>rule, the Bank shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to</textblock>
    <textblock>monitor the AHP-assisted housing units according to the monitoring</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements of §960.14(e) through (h) of the proposed rule. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Bank also shall require the loan fund or loan consortium to</textblock>
    <textblock>require the sponsor or owner of the project to submit to the loan</textblock>
    <textblock>fund or loan consortium such reports and certifications as are</textblock>
    <textblock>required under §960.15(c) of the proposed rule. In addition, the</textblock>
    <textblock>loan fund or loan consortium shall report to the Bank any new loan</textblock>
    <textblock>or grant made using repayments of loans by the borrower. If a</textblock>
    <textblock>loan fund or loan consortium receives loans or grants from an</textblock>
    <textblock>applicant pursuant to separate AHP funding cycles, the use of such</textblock>
    <textblock>funds must be reported separately.</textblock>
    <textblock>The monitoring and reporting requirements in §960.17(d) of the</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed rule are a change from the provisions on monitoring and</textblock>
    <textblock>reporting in the Board's existing policy guidelines, which require</textblock>
    <textblock>the applicant to monitor the loan fund or loan consortium and</textblock>
    <textblock>require the Bank to monitor the applicant. This change is</textblock>
    <textblock>intended to conform the monitoring and reporting requirements for</textblock>
    <textblock>projects involving loan funds or loan consortia with the proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>monitoring and reporting requirements applicable to AHP-assisted</textblock>
    <textblock>housing projects generally under §§960.14 and 960.15 of this</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 960.17(e)(1) of the proposed rule provides that a loan</textblock>
    <textblock>fund or loan consortium receiving loans or grants from applicants</textblock>
    <textblock>pursuant to the AHP and the project sponsors and owners receiving</textblock>
    <textblock>loans or grants from loan funds or loan consortia are subject to</textblock>
    <textblock>the corrective and remedial actions contained in §960.16 of the</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed rule for fraud and non-compliance with respect to the AHP</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 960.17(e)(2)(i) of the proposed rule provides that in</textblock>
    <textblock>the event of a loan fund's or loan consortium's fraud or willful</textblock>
    <textblock>non-compliance with respect to the requirements of this part, the</textblock>
    <textblock>full amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered from the loan</textblock>
    <textblock>fund or loan consortium by the applicant and returned to the Bank,</textblock>
    <textblock>or if previously agreed to by the Bank, shall be recovered by the</textblock>
    <textblock>Bank from the loan fund or loan consortium.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 960.17(e)(2)(ii) of the proposed rule requires an</textblock>
    <textblock>applicant that provides a loan or a grant to a loan fund or loan</textblock>
    <textblock>consortium pursuant to the AHP to have in place either:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) A legally binding agreement or other legally enforceable</textblock>
    <textblock>mechanism that permits the applicant to recover from the loan fund</textblock>
    <textblock>or loan consortium, in the event of fraud or willful</textblock>
    <textblock>non-compliance by the loan fund or loan consortium with respect to</textblock>
    <textblock>the AHP requirements, the full amount of the AHP subsidy; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) If the Bank agrees and such an agreement is legally</textblock>
    <textblock>enforceable, a three-party agreement that includes the Bank, the</textblock>
    <textblock>applicant, and the loan fund or loan consortium, that permits the</textblock>
    <textblock>Bank to recover from the loan fund or loan consortium, in the</textblock>
    <textblock>event of fraud or willful non-compliance by the loan fund or loan</textblock>
    <textblock>consortium with respect to the AHP requirements, the full amount</textblock>
    <textblock>of the AHP subsidy.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 960.17(e)(3)(i) of the proposed rule provides that</textblock>
    <textblock>in the event of a sponsor's or owner's fraud or willful</textblock>
    <textblock>non-compliance with respect to the AHP requirements, the full</textblock>
    <textblock>amount of the AHP subsidy shall be recovered by the loan fund or</textblock>
    <textblock>loan consortium from the sponsor or owner to be used for</textblock>
    <textblock>additional AHP projects.</textblock>
