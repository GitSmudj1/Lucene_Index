    <textblock>105-57.007␣Change in conditions after submission to IRS.</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>31 U.S.C. 3720A.</textblock>
    <textblock>§105-57.001</textblock>
    <textblock>Purpose.</textblock>
    <textblock>This part establishes procedures for the General Services Administration (GSA) to refer past due debts to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for offset against income tax refunds of taxpayers owing debts to GSA.</textblock>
    <textblock>§105-57.002</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability and scope.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) This part implements 31 U.S.C. 3720A which authorizes the IRS to reduce a tax refund by the amount of a past due legally enforceable debt owed to the United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) For purposes of this section, a past due legally enforceable debt referable to the IRS is a debt which is owed to the United States and:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Has been delinquent for at least three months but, except in the case of a judgment debt, has not been delinquent more than ten years at the time the offset is made;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) With respect to which, GSA has given the taxpayer at least 60 days, from the date of notification, to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past due or legally enforceable, has considered such evidence, and has determined that the debt is past due and legally enforceable;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the salary offset provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5514(a)(1);</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Cannot be currently collected pursuant to the administrative offset provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3716;</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Has been disclosed by GSA to a credit reporting agency, including a consumer reporting agency as authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3711(f);</textblock>
    <textblock>(6) With respect to which, GSA has notified, or has made a reasonable attempt to notify, the taxpayer that the debt is past due and, unless repaid within 60 days thereafter, will be referred to the IRS for offset against any income tax refunds due the taxpayer;</textblock>
    <textblock>(7) Is at least $25.00;</textblock>
    <textblock>(8) All other requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3720A and the Department of the Treasury regulations relating to eligibility of a debt for tax refund offset, at 26 CFR 301.6402-6T, have been satisfied.</textblock>
    <textblock>§105-57.003</textblock>
    <textblock>Administrative charges.</textblock>
    <textblock>All administrative charges incurred in connection with the referral of debts to the IRS will be added to the debt, thus increasing the amount of the offset.</textblock>
    <textblock>§105-57.004</textblock>
    <textblock>Reasonable attempt to notify.</textblock>
    <textblock>In order to constitute a reasonable attempt to notify the debtor, GSA must have used a mailing address for the debtor obtained from the IRS pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6103 (m)(2) or (m)(4), within one year preceding the attempt to notify the debtor.</textblock>
    <textblock>§105-57.005</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice requirement before offset.</textblock>
    <textblock>The notification provided by GSA to the debtor will inform the debtor how to go about presenting evidence to GSA that all or part of the debt is either not past due or is not legally enforceable.</textblock>
    <textblock>§105-57.006</textblock>
    <textblock>Consideration of evidence.</textblock>
    <textblock>Evidence submitted by the debtor will be considered by officials or employees of GSA. Any determination that an amount of such debt is past due and legally enforceable will be made by such officials or employees. Evidence that the debt is affected by a bankruptcy proceeding involving the debtor shall bar referral of the debt.</textblock>
    <textblock>§105-57.007</textblock>
    <textblock>Change in conditions after submission to IRS.</textblock>
    <textblock>If the amount of a debt is reduced after submission by GSA and offset by IRS, GSA will refund to the debtor any excess amount and will promptly notify IRS of the refund. GSA will also promptly notify the IRS if, after submission of a debt to the IRS for offset, GSA:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Determines that an error has been made with respect to the information submitted;</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Receives a payment or credits a payment to an account submitted; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Receives notification that the debtor has filed for bankruptcy under Title 11 of the United States Code or has been adjudicated bankrupt and the debt has been discharged.</textblock>
