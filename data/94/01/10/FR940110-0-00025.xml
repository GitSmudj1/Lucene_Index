    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The General Services Administration (GSA) has determined that this rule is not a significant rule for the purposes of Executive Order (E.O.) 12866 of September 10, 1993, because it is not likely to result in an economic impact exceeding $100 million or more, to have a material adverse effect on the economy, environment or safety, to interfere with the actions of another agency, to materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs, or to raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in E.O. 12866. Therefore, a regulatory assessment has not been prepared. GSA has based all administrative decisions underlying this rule on adequate information concerning the need for and the consequence of this rule; has determined that the potential benefits to society from this rule outweigh the potential costs; has maximized the net benefits; and has chosen the alternative approach involving the least net cost to society.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The General Services Administration has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.).</textblock>
