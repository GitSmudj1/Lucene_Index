    <textblock>(or hemoglobin), serum iron, transferrin saturation, serum</textblock>
    <textblock>ferritin, and blood pressure must be measured.</textblock>

    <textblock>hemoglobin level) higher than 30 percent. (Patients with</textblock>
    <textblock>severe angina, severe pulmonary distress, or severe</textblock>
    <textblock>hypertension may require EPO to prevent adverse symptoms</textblock>
