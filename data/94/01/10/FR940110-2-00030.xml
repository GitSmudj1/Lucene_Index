The first alternative involves the development of Cameron Station as follows: mixed residential on 70 acres, commercial/retail on 16 acres, open space/recreation on 50.5 acres, and 16 acres for infrastructure use. The second alternative would place all buildings and grounds in caretaker status.</textblock>
