    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This hearing is being held to consider proposals to amend five Federal milk marketing orders. The proposals would establish a multiple component pricing plan for pricing producer milk under the orders. Producer milk utilized in Class II and Class III would be priced to handlers on the basis of three components. The components priced would be butterfat, protein and solids-not-fat other than protein. Under some of the proposals, producer prices or protein prices would be adjusted for quality attributes of milk, such as somatic cell content. The hearing was requested by a dairy trade association and several cooperative associations that represent a substantial number of dairy farmers who supply these markets. A number of other dairy cooperative associations and dairy organizations submitted proposals to be considered at the hearing. The proponents maintain that the proposed payment plans would give producers a direct economic incentive to produce the components valued by the marketplace.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>This administrative action is governed by the provisions of Sections 556 and 557 of title 5 of the United States Code and therefore, is excluded from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice is hereby given of a public hearing to be held at the Sheraton Inn Airport, 2500 E. 79th Street, Bloomington, Minnesota 55425 (telephone 612/854-1771), beginning at 9 a.m. on January 25, 1994, with respect to proposed amendments to the tentative marketing agreements and to the orders regulating the handling of milk in the aforesaid marketing areas.</textblock>
    <textblock>The hearing is called pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), and the applicable rules of practice and procedure governing the formulation of marketing agreements and marketing orders (7 CFR part 900).</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of the hearing is to receive evidence with respect to the economic and marketing conditions which relate to the proposed amendments, hereinafter set forth, and any appropriate modifications thereof, to the tentative marketing agreements and to the orders.</textblock>
    <textblock>Actions under the Federal milk order programs are subject to the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). This Act seeks to ensure that, within the statutory authority of a program, the regulatory and information requirements are tailored to the size and nature of small businesses. For the purpose of the Act, a dairy farm is a ``small business'' if it has an annual gross revenue of less than $500,000, and a dairy products manufacturer is a ``small business'' if it has fewer than 500 employees. Most parties subject to a milk order are considered as a small business. Accordingly, interested parties are invited to present evidence on the probable regulatory and informational impact of the hearing proposals on small businesses. Also, parties may suggest modifications of these proposals for the purpose of tailoring their applicability to small business.</textblock>
    <textblock>The amendments to the rules proposed herein have been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. They are not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, the proposed amendments would not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with these rules.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with the law and requesting a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district courts of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after date of the entry of the ruling.</textblock>
    <textblock>Interested parties who wish to introduce exhibits should provide the Presiding Officer at the hearing with 6 copies of such exhibits for the Official Record. Also, it would be helpful if additional copies are available for the use of other participants at the hearing.</textblock>
