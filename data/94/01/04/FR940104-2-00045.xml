    <textblock>Office of the Assistant Secretary for Community Planning and Development.</textblock>
    <textblock>Description of the Need for the Information and its Proposed Use:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Empowerment Zone/Enterprise Community Program is authorized by Title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993. The statute requires the Secretaries of HUD and Agriculture to make designations of empowerment zones and enterprise communities from among eligible areas based on a Strategic Plan which addresses the human, physical, economic and community development problems in the area. HUD has prepared an application form HUD-40003 to allow applicants to apply for designation. We are asking the OMB for expedited clearance of the application form to allow the maximum time possible for eligible applications to prepare their applications.</textblock>
    <textblock>Respondents:</textblock>
    <textblock>Units of general local government together with their appropriate State and State Certified Economic Development Corporations may apply.</textblock>
    <textblock>Frequency of response:</textblock>
    <textblock>This is a one time application process. The Secretaries of HUD and Agriculture are authorized to make a maximum number of designations each, as specified by the statute in urban and rural areas.</textblock>
    <textblock>Reporting burden:</textblock>
    <textblock>Status:</textblock>
    <textblock>This is a new collection for a one-time appropriation.</textblock>
