    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>NMFS has determined that the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon should be reclassified from threatened to endangered under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (ESA). NMFS has determined that the current biological status of the species is endangered based on the continued decline and increased variability of run sizes since its first listing as a threatened species in 1989, the expectation of weak returns in certain years as the result of two small year classes (1991 and 1993), and continuing threats to the population. Although measures implemented through consultations conducted under section 7 of the ESA and State and Federal regulatory actions are designed to reduce adverse impacts on the species, quantifiable improvements in population levels are not likely to be evident for several years. NMFS will continue to closely monitor the status of this population, and evaluate the protective measures to determine whether there is evidence that these measures have reduced or eliminated threats to the species and whether a change in status may be warranted.</textblock>

    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the ESA and its implementing regulations (50 CFR part 424), an ``endangered species'' is any species that is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portion of its range. A ``threatened species'' is any species that is likely to become an endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significant portion of its range. Based on a review of the status of the Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon and the factors affecting the species, NMFS has determined that it is endangered.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Sacramento River winter-run chinook salmon is a unique population that is distinguishable from other chinook salmon runs in the Sacramento River based on the timing of its upstream migration and spawning period. For the most part, the winter-run chinook salmon population is comprised of three year classes, each of which primarily returns to spawn as 3-year old fish.</textblock>
    <textblock>The best available data on winter-run chinook salmon abundance are the annual estimates of the spawning run size made by the California Department of Fish and Game (CDFG) based on counts of fish passing the Red Bluff Diversion Dam. The CDFG began estimating the annual run size for winter-run chinook salmon in 1967 after the Dam was placed in operation. This time series of annual run size estimates has documented a precipitous decline in the winter-run chinook salmon to its present low level (Table 1).</textblock>
