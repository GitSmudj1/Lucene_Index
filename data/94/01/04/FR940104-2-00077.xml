    <textblock>December 28, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>Odetics, Inc. (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified securities from listing and registration on the American Stock Exchange, Inc. (``Amex'').</textblock>
    <textblock>The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing these securities from listing and registration include the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>According to the Company, its Board of Directors (the ``Board'') unanimously approved resolutions on November 18, 1993, to withdraw the Company's Class A and Class B Common Stock from listing on the Amex and, instead, list such Common Stock on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations/National Market Systems (``NASDAQ/NMS''). According to the Company, the decision of the Board followed a lengthy study of the matter, and was based upon the belief that listing of the Class A and Class B Common Stock on NASDAQ/NMS will be more beneficial to its stockholders than the present listing on the Amex because:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The Company believes that the liquidity may be improved through the multiple market maker system; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The Company believes that the visibility and possibly research coverage may increase with improved liquidity.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any interested person may, on or before January 20, 1994, submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.</textblock>
