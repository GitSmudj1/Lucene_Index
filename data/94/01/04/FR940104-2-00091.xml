    <textblock>Special Applications</textblock>
    <textblock>NTIA possesses the discretionary authority to recommend awarding grants to eligible broadcast and nonbroadcast applicants whose proposals are so unique or innovative that they do not clearly fall within the priorities listed below. Innovative projects submitted under this category must address demonstrated and substantial community needs (e.g., service to identifiable ethnic or linguistic minority audiences, service to the blind or deaf, electronic text, and nonbroadcast projects offering educational or instructional services).</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority 1_Provision of Public Telecommunications Facilities for First Radio and Television Signals to a Geographic Area</textblock>
    <textblock>There are three subcategories:</textblock>
    <textblock>A.</textblock>
    <textblock>Projects that include local origination capacity.</textblock>
    <textblock>This subcategory includes the planning or construction of new facilities that can provide a full range of radio and/or television programs including material that is locally produced.</textblock>
    <textblock>B.</textblock>
    <textblock>Projects that do not include local origination capacity.</textblock>
    <textblock>This subcategory includes projects such as increases in tower height and/or power of existing stations and construction of translators, cable networks, and repeater transmitters that will result in providing public telecommunications services to previously unserved areas.</textblock>

    <textblock>Projects that provide first nationally distributed programming.</textblock>
    <textblock>This subcategory includes projects that provide satellite downlink facilities to noncommercial radio and television stations that would bring nationally distributed programming to a geographic area for the first time.</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority 1 and its subcategories apply only to grant applicants proposing to plan or construct new facilities to bring public telecommunications services to geographic areas that are presently unserved.</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority 2_Replacement of Basic Equipment of Existing Essential Broadcast Stations</textblock>
    <textblock>Projects eligible for consideration under this category include the urgent replacement of obsolete or worn out equipment in existing broadcast stations that provide either the only public telecommunications signal or the only locally originated public telecommunications signal to a geographical area.</textblock>
    <textblock>Priority 3_Establishment of a First Local Origination Capacity in a Geographical Area</textblock>
