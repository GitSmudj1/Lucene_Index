    <textblock>I. Introduction</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 4, 1992, the Commission issued Order No. 497-D</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>in response to the opinion issued by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in</textblock>
    <textblock>Tenneco Gas</textblock>
    <textblock>v.</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Tenneco)</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>which upheld in substantial part Order Nos. 497 and 497-A,</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>the Commission's final rule governing the relationship between interstate natural gas pipelines and their marketing or brokering affiliates. However, the court found that the Commission did not adequately justify its extension of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of §161.3(f)</textblock>
    <textblock>4</textblock>
    <textblock>of the Commission's regulations to gas sales and marketing information. Further, in its review of Ozark Gas Transmission System (Ozark),</textblock>
    <textblock>5</textblock>
    <textblock>a consolidated case, the court found that, based upon the evidence in the record, the Commission erred in finding Order No. 497 applicable to Ozark Gas Transmission System (Ozark), a joint venture. Accordingly, the court remanded the proceeding to the Commission. In response to the court's remand, the Commission issued Order No. 497-D which revised §161.3(f) to narrow the scope of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement with respect to sales and marketing information, and found that Ozark is subject to the requirements of Order No. 497. In addition, Order No. 497-D extended the sunset date of Order No. 497's reporting requirements from December 31, 1992, until December 31, 1993. However, the order stated that 90 days after the Commission has determined that an individual pipeline is in full compliance with Order No. 636,</textblock>
    <textblock>6</textblock>
    <textblock>the pipeline would not be required to submit the affiliated transportation log (FERC Form No. 592) to the Commission. The order stated that the pipeline must continue to maintain and provide its affiliated transportation log information on its electronic bulletin board (EBB).</textblock>
    <textblock>This order (1) deletes the remaining categories of gas sales and marketing information from the contemporaneous disclosure requirement, (2) affirms the Commission's decision to eliminate the filing of Form 592, (3) affirms the Commission's decision that Ozark is subject to Order No. 497, (4) rejects Hadson Gas Systems, Inc.'s (Hadson) argument that the Commission's procedures for acting on §§161.3(j) and 284.286(e) filings prohibit public participation, (5) requires all future standards of conduct filings made under section 161.3(j) and all requests for waiver of the standards to include form notices, suitable for publishing in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>, (6) clarifies what type of employee is an ``operating employee'' for purposes of the Order No. 497 regulations, and (7) extends the sunset date of Order No. 497's reporting requirements until June 30, 1994, because concurrently with this order the Commission is issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR) in Docket No. RM94-6-000 which proposes to revise Order No. 497's reporting requirements.</textblock>
