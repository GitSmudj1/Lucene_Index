  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') has adopted amendments to Form F-9 under the multijurisdictional disclosure system (``MJDS'') for Canadian issuers which will recognize investment grade ratings by securities rating organizations recognized by Canadian securities regulators for purposes of filings on Forms F-9 and 40-F. These amendments have been adopted in light of the Commission's experience with the MJDS and should further facilitate transnational capital formation. They are being made effective in light of the adoption by Canadian securities regulators of parallel amendments to the MJDS in Canada for U.S. issuers.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Amendments to Form F-9</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 3, 1993, the Commission adopted several amendments to the MJDS.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the November 3 Release, the Commission stated that the amendments to Form F-9</textblock>
    <textblock>relating to recognition of investment grade ratings by securities rating organizations recognized by Canadian securities regulators would not become effective until such time as the Canadian securities regulators had adopted parallel amendments to the multijurisdictional disclosure system in Canada for U.S. issuers.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Canadian securities regulators have now adopted such amendments with an effective date of December 31, 1993. As a result, the Commission is publishing this release to make effective the amendments to Form F-9 described above.</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act [5 U.S.C. 605], at the time the Commission issued its release proposing the amendments being adopted hereby, the Chairman of the Commission certified that such amendments will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. That certification, including the reasons therefor, was attached as an Appendix to such release and was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Cost-Benefit Analysis</textblock>
    <textblock>No specific data were provided in response to the Commission's request regarding the costs and benefits of the amendments being adopted today. Some commenters indicated that these amendments would save Canadian issuers the expense of obtaining a securities rating from those rating organizations currently specified under Form F-9.</textblock>
    <textblock>IV. Effective Date</textblock>
    <textblock>The amendments to Form F-9 shall be effective on the date of publication in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act, which allows effectiveness in less than 30 days after publication for ``a substantive rule which grants or recognizes an exemption or relieves a restriction.'' 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(1).</textblock>
    <textblock>V. Statutory Bases</textblock>
    <textblock>The amendments to the Commission's rule and form are being proposed pursuant to sections 6, 7, 8, 10 and 19(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Sections 3(b), 4A, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 23 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.</textblock>
