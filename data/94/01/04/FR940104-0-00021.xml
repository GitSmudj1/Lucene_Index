    <textblock>2. Commission Ruling</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission rejects Hadson's argument that its procedures for acting on §161.3(j) and §284.286(e) filings prohibit public participation. Hadson misinterprets §284.286(e). It requires pipelines to file procedures for complying with standards of conduct as part of their publicly noticed compliance filings.</textblock>
    <textblock>34</textblock>
    <textblock>Any interested person can participate in those proceedings and protest pipelines' proposals for complying with the standards. All the pipelines' compliance filings have been publicly available and Hadson, as well as other interested persons, have had ample opportunity to comment on those procedures. In fact, Hadson intervened in 91 restructuring proceedings and filed comments with respect to several pipelines' standards of conduct.</textblock>
    <textblock>35</textblock>
    <textblock>Contrary to Hadson's claims of ``stealth,'' the Commission's decisions with respect to the standards of conduct will be reviewed in the context of the restructuring proceedings.</textblock>
    <textblock>The public also participated in the proceedings in which the Commission reviewed the standards of conduct pipelines had filed before Order No. 636 required restructuring. Although the Commission labeled these proceedings as ``non-adversarial,''</textblock>
    <textblock>36</textblock>
    <textblock>and invited the public to file complaints,</textblock>
    <textblock>37</textblock>
    <textblock>it also addressed all requests for rehearing of the May 1991 standards of conduct decisions (these dockets have the prefix MG).</textblock>
    <textblock>38</textblock>
    <textblock>Eight parties sought rehearing of the May 1991 MG orders.</textblock>
    <textblock>39</textblock>
    <textblock>Of those, IGM asked the Commission to address its previous protests.</textblock>
    <textblock>40</textblock>
    <textblock>In the Order on Rehearing, the Commission individually addressed each of IGM's previous allegations concerning pipelines' implementation of the standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>41</textblock>
    <textblock>Hadson had the same opportunity to file comments and protests in the pipelines' pre-Order No. 636 standards of conduct (MG) proceedings and did not.</textblock>
    <textblock>Finally, Hadson incorrectly states that the Commission treated the MG filings as non-public. These filings are public and are available through the Commission's Records Information and Management System. In addition, all conversations that occurred between the Commission staff and pipelines were memorialized in memoranda that were placed in the Commission's public files.</textblock>
    <textblock>42</textblock>
    <textblock>The public had an opportunity to raise issues concerning those conversations during rehearing of the May 1991 orders.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, not only are the MG filings public, but contrary to Hadson's assertions, they have no real relation to our decision to eliminate the requirement to file Form 592s. The MG dockets concern the pipelines' general implementation of the standards of conduct. In contrast, Form 592 is a log of specific transportation transactions. As stated, we are eliminating the requirements to file Form 592s because the information contained in them will be available on pipelines' EBBs.</textblock>
    <textblock>43</textblock>
    <textblock>However, the Commission does agree that, prospectively, it can facilitate access to pipelines' standards of conduct filings by publicly noticing them. As a result, the Commission will require all future standards of conduct filings made under §161.3(j) and all requests for waiver of the standards to include form notices suitable for publishing in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>E. Interpretation of ``Operating Employee''</textblock>
    <textblock>In response to questions raised by Hadson and other companies and in order to assist pipelines in their compliance with the separation of operating personnel as required by Standard G and the reporting requirements of §250.16(b), the Commission will clarify what type of employee it considers an ``operating employee.''</textblock>
    <textblock>Standard G, 18 CFR 161.3(g), states that ``[t]o the maximum extent practicable a [pipeline's] operating employees and the operating employees of its marketing affiliate must function independently of each other.'' In addition, under the reporting requirements of §250.16(b), ``[a]n interstate pipeline must file *␣*␣* (1)[n]ew and existing tariff provisions containing *␣*␣* (i) [a] complete list of operating personnel and facilities shared by the interstate natural gas pipeline and the affiliated marketing or brokering company.''</textblock>
