    <textblock>The information collection requirements contained in the referenced sections have been previously approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisions of 44 U.S.C. chapter 35 and have been assigned OMB numbers 0581-0116 for navel oranges and 0581-0121 for Valencia oranges.</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule reduces the reporting burden on approximately 25 processors of navel and Valencia oranges who had been completing Form 38, taking about 0.33 hour to complete each report. This rule also reduces the reporting burden on approximately 210 handlers who ship primarily by truck, taking about 0.40 hour to complete each report. About 80 handlers who ship by rail at some point during a season will continue to use Form 3, taking approximately 0.20 hour to complete the report.</textblock>
    <textblock>Based on these considerations, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>After consideration of all relevant material presented, the information and recommendations submitted by the committees, and other information, it is found that finalizing the interim final rule, without change, as published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(58 FR 53112, October 14, 1993) will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.</textblock>
