    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Order Extending Time for Comments and Reply Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>Adopted: December 27, 1993; Released: December 28, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment Date: January 25, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Reply Comment Date: February 9, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>By the Chief Engineer:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. On December 23, 1993, the Cable-Consumer Electronics Compatibility Advisory Group (Advisory Group) requested that the time for filing comments to the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) in the above-captioned proceeding be extended from January 10, 1994 to January 25, 1994 and that the reply comment date be extended from January 25, 1994 to February 9, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. In its request, the Advisory Group indicates that a 15 day extension of the comment periods would increase the chances that the cable and consumer electronics industries, though the Advisory Group, will be able to prepare a joint filing that help to narrow the issues in dispute between those industries and should increase the quality of such joint submission.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The Commission does not routinely grant extensions of time.</textblock>
    <textblock>In this instance, however, we believe that extending the comment deadline by 15 days will serve the public interest by providing the cable and consumer electronics industries additional opportunity to reach a consensus on the proposals set forth in the NPRM and should result in a improved record being submitted to the Commission. We also believe it is in the public interest to extend the reply comment deadline correspondingly. Accordingly,</textblock>
    <textblock>it is ordered</textblock>
    <textblock>That the deadline for filing comments is extended to January 25, 1994, and the deadline for filing reply comments is extended to February 9, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. This action is taken pursuant to authority found in sections 4(i) and 303 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i) and 303, and pursuant to 47 CFR 0.31, 0.241, and 1.46.
