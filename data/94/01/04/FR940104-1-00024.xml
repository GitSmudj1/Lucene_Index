    <textblock>General Instructions</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The notation f(m,n) will be used to denote a numeric string of length ``m'' including a decimal (``.'') with ``n'' digits following the decimal.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. In preparing the required flat file, the following conventions must be followed:</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) All numeric fields must not be left blank and must be right justified unless indicated otherwise.</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) All money items should be rounded to the nearest dollar except where noted.</textblock>
    <textblock>(C) All volumetric data should be stated in MMbtu's (rounded to the nearest MMbtu), except where noted.</textblock>
    <textblock>(D) All rates should be stated in cents per MMbtu fixed decimal numbers, format f(10,2). For example, $1.5264/MMbtu should be stated as 152.64.</textblock>
    <textblock>(E) Negative values should be reported with a ``^'' sign preceding the first nonzero digit reported.</textblock>
    <textblock>(F) Commas must not be included in any numeric field.</textblock>
    <textblock>(G) Percents should be reported as whole numbers between 0 and 100 inclusive.</textblock>
    <textblock>(H) All dates should be reported as six digit numerics (year, month, day), unless otherwise indicated.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The sequence number is the sequential number assigned to a record as it is recorded on a schedule/record. The sequence number is incremented as additional records are added to a schedule/record and will be between 1 and 999,999, inclusive. (</textblock>
    <textblock>Note:</textblock>
    <textblock>The sequence number should be right justified, zero filled.)</textblock>
    <textblock>4. The reference number is the alphanumeric string formed by concatenation of the Schedule ID, Record ID, sequence number, and item location number. E.g., a respondent's Company ID reported in the first record on the ``General Information'' record would have reference number ``X101000001011'' formed by joining (concatenating) the schedule ID ``X1'', the record ID ``01'', the sequence number ``000001'', and the item location number ``011''.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Report any footnote relative to any item reported on Schedule X1 in the ``Footnotes Record'', (Record 06 of Schedule X1). Each footnote should be cross referenced to the schedule and record (line) it pertains to by the appropriate reference number. E.g., a footnote for Company ID reported in the first record of the ``General Information'' record, (Schedule X1, Record 01), would be recorded in the ``Footnote Record,'' (Schedule X1, Record 06), using the reference number ``X101000001011''. At a minimum, the respondent should report the following information, in footnotes, for each contract/ request reported in the ``Transportation Service Data Record,'' (Schedule X1, Record 02).</textblock>
    <textblock>a. The field ``Respondent Affiliation,'' item number 15, should be footnoted to provide a complete list of personnel and facilities shared by the interstate pipeline and affiliated marketer or broker, or by the interstate pipeline and its blanket sales operating unit. Negative reports are required.</textblock>
    <textblock>b. The field ``Disposition of Request,'' item number 11, should be footnoted to provide any complaints and the disposition of such complaints by the shipper or end user concerning the requested or furnished service.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. Source of codes.</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) Pipeline Company ID: Use the code for the pipeline as contained in the Buyer Seller Code List, U.S. Department of Energy's publication DOE/EIA-0176. A code may be obtained by calling EIA at (202) 254-5435.</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) Contract ID: The respondent's own designation for the contract or agreement covering the transaction being reported. This identifier will either be assigned by the respondent or the party providing a service to the respondent.</textblock>
    <textblock>7. A pipeline blanket sales operating unit is any entity operating under a subpart J of part 284 blanket sales certificate, and is considered the functional equivalent of a marketing affiliate.</textblock>
