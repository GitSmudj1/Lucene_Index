Under the partial consent decree, the defendants will pay a $100,000 civil penalty to the U.S. Treasury, and will provide up to $225,000 in funding for projects to improve and protect wetlands and water quality in the same watershed where the alleged violations occurred. If entered by the Court, the proposed partial consent decree, in conjunction with the previously entered partial consent decree, will fully resolve this litigation.</textblock>
