    <textblock>3. Served outside the continental United States in direct support of Air Transport Command-directed flight operations during the period December 14, 1941 through August 14, 1945.</textblock>
    <textblock>Qualifying periods of time are computed from the date of departure from the continental United States to the date of return to the continental United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>Application Procedures</textblock>
    <textblock>Before an individual can receive any VA benefits, the person must first apply for an Armed Forces Discharge Certificate by filling out a DD Form 2168 and sending it to the following address: HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-6001, ATTN: Sgt White.</textblock>
    <textblock>Important: Applicants must attach supporting documents to their DD Form 2168 application. Considered of primary importance will be any employment records from Northwest Airlines headquarters. Other supporting documentation might include copies of passports with appropriate entries, flight log books, Army Air Force Identification Forms 133, any personal employment records such as commendations regarding ATC performance, employee expense reports of charges to USAAF contracts, medical certifications prior to departure from U.S., USAAF passes to leave the limits of an overseas base, military orders, miscellaneous USAAF papers, etc. Additionally, the captain of a flight crew may provide written confirmation for other crew members on the flight.</textblock>
    <textblock>Upon confirmation of an applicant's eligibility the DD-214 will be passed from HQ AFMPC/DPMARS2 to the Awards and Decorations office (in the same building) to determine which ribbons the applicant is eligible to receive (campaign ribbons, theater ribbons, victory medal, etc.). Specific awards (i.e., Silver Star, Purple Heart, Air Medal, etc.) need separate justification detailing the act, achievement, or service believed to warrant the appropriate medal/ribbon.</textblock>
    <textblock>DD Forms 2168 are available from VA offices or from the U.S. Air Force offices in this notice.</textblock>
