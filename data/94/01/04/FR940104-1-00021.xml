    <textblock>VI. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification</textblock>
    <textblock>The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (RFA)</textblock>
    <textblock>34</textblock>
    <textblock>generally requires a description and analysis of final rules that will have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Pursuant to section 605(b) of the RFA, the Commission hereby certifies that the regulations proposed herein will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>VII. Information Collection Requirement</textblock>
    <textblock>Office of Management and Budget (OMB) regulations require approval of certain information collection requirements imposed by agency rules.</textblock>
    <textblock>35</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed rule revises and reduces the reporting requirements/burden under existing FERC-592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines (OMB Control No. 1902-0157).</textblock>
    <textblock>The information required under FERC-592 enables the Commission to carry out its legislative mandate under the NGA and NGPA and will help ensure a viable capacity release market under the Commission's Order No. 636. Specifically, the required information allows the Commission to review/monitor pipeline transportation, sales, and storage transactions with its marketing affiliates to deter undue discrimination and to take appropriate action, where and when necessary. The information is also used by others to indicate whether or not there has been discrimination in pipeline/affiliate/nonaffiliate transactions.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission is submitting notification of these FERC-592 information requirements to OMB for its review and approval. Interested persons may obtain further information by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208-1415]. Comments on the requirements of the subject proposed rule may also be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission].</textblock>
