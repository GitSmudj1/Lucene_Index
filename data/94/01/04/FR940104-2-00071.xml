    <textblock>In response to today's competitive market environment, the PSE has proposed to codify its policy that members should make their best efforts not to interfere in another member's cross transaction and, in particular, that the specialist should not participate unless he or she is liquidating a position. The PSE also has proposed to add a new requirement, based on a comparable rule on the Phlx, that the specialist's proprietary bid or offer yield to the customer side of a cross transaction at the cross price.</textblock>
    <textblock>Looking at the proposal as whole, the Commission believes that it will clarify the roles of various market participants and assure that, under routine circumstances, crosses are executed in a fair and orderly manner. In sum, the Commission finds that this proposed rule change should improve the PSE's ability to compete for block business and should enhance the depth and liquidity of the Exchange market.</textblock>
    <textblock>In terms of auction market principles, the Commission believes that the proposed rule change strikes an appropriate balance between the competing needs of various customer orders represented for execution on the PSE and the proprietary trading operations of Exchange members and member organizations, including specialists. The Commission notes that Rule 5.14(b) will continue to require that a member effecting a cross transaction first assure that all existing bids or offers on the specialist's book or represented in the trading crowd, at or better than the cross price, are filled at their limits.</textblock>
    <textblock>On that basis, the Commission has concluded that the PSE proposal adheres to the auction market principles of time and price priority and that this method for the execution of crosses (and, in particular, the priority granted to the customer side of the transaction) will not disadvantage existing orders.</textblock>
    <textblock>In fact, limit orders on the PSE which coincide with the cross price could benefit from being assured of receiving an execution at that price.</textblock>
    <textblock>Furthermore, the Commission finds that the PSE proposal does not restrict the opportunity for customer orders to receive price improvement. To this end, the Commission interprets the proposed commentary to Rule 5.14(b), and the Exchange agrees with that interpretation,</textblock>
    <textblock>to allow the specialist to participate in a cross transaction to provide one side with a better price, notwithstanding the other provisions of this rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, under the PSE's method, it is possible for interest in the trading crowd, including an order for the principal account of a member, to break up the cross and to improve the price.</textblock>
    <textblock>Finally, the Commission believes that the PSE proposal would not grant priority, parity or precedence to the order of a member in a manner inconsistent with section 11(a)(1)(G) of the Act or SEC Rule 11a1-1(T)(a)(3) thereunder.</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of its proposed rule change, the PSE has defined the term ``customer order'' as an order that a broker represents in an agency capacity, including a professional order that is not for an account associated with the executing broker. Because this definition of ``customer order'' excludes (and, thus, does not grant priority to) an order for an account over which the broker or an associated person of the broker exercises investment discretion, the Commission is satisfied that the proposed rule change complies with section 11(a).</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof. Amendments No. 1 and No. 2 merely clarify certain language used in the original filing and make no substantive changes to the proposed rule. Finally, the Commission did not receive any comments on the original proposal, which was noticed for the full statutory period.</textblock>

  <footnote>
    <textblock>As noted above, this part of the PSE proposal is based on recent amendments to Phlx Rule 126. See</textblock>
    <textblock>supra,</textblock>
    <textblock>note 16. Briefly, the Phlx requires that a member's proprietary bid or offer yield to the customer side of a cross transaction at the cross price. In approving the Phlx proposal, the Commission took note of the fact that most principal trading activity on the floor of that regional stock exchange, other than facilitation crosses, is undertaken by the specialist.</textblock>
