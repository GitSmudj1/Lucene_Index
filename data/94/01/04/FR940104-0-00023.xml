    <textblock>The information required under FERC-592 enables the Commission to carry out its legislative mandate under the NGA and NGPA and will help ensure a viable capacity release market under the Commission's Order No. 636. Specifically, the required information allows the Commission to review/monitor pipeline transportation, sales, and storage transactions with its marketing affiliates to deter undue discrimination and to take appropriate action, where and when necessary. The information is also used by others to indicate whether or not there has been discrimination in pipeline/affiliate/nonaffiliate transactions.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission is notifying OMB that there is no change in the FERC-592 reporting requirements as a result of the subject order and requesting that OMB extend its approval of FERC-592 through June 30, 1994. The 180-day extension of FERC-592 is necessary to allow the Commission adequate time to prepare a final rule based on the related NOPR, issued concurrently with this order, in Docket No. RM94-6-000 (Standards of Conduct and Reporting Requirements for Transportation and Affiliate Transactions).</textblock>
    <textblock>Interested persons may obtain further information by contacting the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208-1415]. Comments on the FERC-592 reporting requirements may also be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission].</textblock>
    <textblock>VI. Effective Date</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)</textblock>
    <textblock>46</textblock>
    <textblock>generally requires a rule to be effective not less than 30 days after publication in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>unless good cause is found to shorten the time period. The sunset date for the reporting requirements will expire before the APA's 30 day publication requirement has been fulfilled thus causing a gap in the reporting requirements. Therefore, in order to prevent a gap in the rule's reporting requirements, this final rule is effective January 1, 1994.</textblock>
