    <textblock>(A) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Changes</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of the proposed changes is to establish fees for reports produced from individual files and new combinations of files in the MCC/MSTC File Transmission Service. MCC/MSTC's File Transmission Service (``FTS'') (File Nos. SR-MCC-87-6 and SR-MSTC-87-7)</textblock>
    <textblock>provides a computer-to-computer interface for the transmission of data between MCC/MSTC and their participants.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed rule changes are consistent with section 17A of the Act in that they provide for the equitable allocation of reasonable fees and other charges among participants using MCC and MSTC facilities.</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement on burden on Competition</textblock>
    <textblock>MCC and MSTC do not believe that the proposed rule changes will impose a burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the proposes of the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>(C) Self-Regulatory Organizations' Statement of Comments on the Proposed Rule Changes Received from Members, Participants, or Others</textblock>
    <textblock>Comments were neither solicited nor received.</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Date of Effectiveness of the Proposed Rule Changes and Timing for Commission Action</textblock>
    <textblock>The foregoing rule changes became effective pursuant to section 19(b)(3)(A)(ii) of the Act and Rule 19b-4(e)(2) thereunder because they establish or change a due, fee, or other charge of the self-regulatory organizations. At any time within sixty days of the filing of such proposed rule changes, the Commission may summarily abrogate such rule changes if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purpose of the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>IV. Solicitation of Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views, and arguments concerning the foregoing. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submissions, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule changes that are filed with the Commission, and all written communication relating to the proposed rule changes between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street NW., Washington, DC 20549.
