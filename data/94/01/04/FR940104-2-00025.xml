    <textblock>Several alternatives were evaluated. A no action alternative was evaluated for both subprojects. Two alternative routes for the new sewer main in the East Area were examined. An alternative route for the sewer main to the outlying areas was not evaluated since the only practical route follows the existing creek crossings.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed upgrades occurring in the floodplain would not have any long-term effects upon the floodplain or surrounding environment. Only during construction could the project potentially affect the floodplain or the aquatic life in White Oak Creek and the impacts, if any, would be negligible. During construction, sediment could be introduced into the creek and unnamed tributary. DOE will prepare a sediment control plan identifying the best management practices to be employed during construction to minimize potential harm to or within the affected floodplain. Control measures would include the use of sediment and erosion control fences to minimize siltation. Procedural measures would include excavating trenches of the minimum size and performing construction activities during dry periods. Immediately upon installation of sections of the sewer line, the trench would be backfilled and compacted. The area would then be graded to the original contour and seeded. The upgrade project would conform to all applicable State and local floodplain protection standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>DOE will endeavor to allow 15 days of public review after publication of the Statement of Findings prior to implementing the proposed action.</textblock>
