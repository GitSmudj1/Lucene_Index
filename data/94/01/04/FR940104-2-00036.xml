    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA provides research contracts to the NAS/IOM to support the preparation of the Food Chemicals Codex, a compendium of specifications for substances used as food ingredients. Before the inclusion of any specifications in a Food Chemicals Codex publication, public announcement will be made in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. All interested parties are invited to comment and to make suggestions for consideration. Suggestions should be accompanied by supporting data or documentation to facilitate and expedite review by the Committee on Food Chemicals Codex.</textblock>

    <textblock>Federal Registers</textblock>
    <textblock>of January 11, 1991 (56 FR 1198), and April 9, 1991 (56 FR 14382), FDA announced that the NAS/IOM Committee on Food Chemicals Codex was considering new monographs and monograph revisions for inclusion in the third supplement to the Food Chemicals Codex, third edition, which has since been published.
