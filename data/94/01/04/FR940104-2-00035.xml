    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>In a notice published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of April 22, 1993 (58 FR 21583), FDA announced that a petition (FAP 2B4341) had been filed on behalf of Milliken Chemical, c/o 1001 G St. NW., suite 500 West, Washington, DC 20001, proposing that the food additive regulations in ยง178.3295</textblock>
    <textblock>Clarifying agents for polymers</textblock>
    <textblock>(21 CFR 178.3295) be amended to provide for the safe use of dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol as a clarifying agent for polypropylene articles intended for use in contact with food.</textblock>
    <textblock>Upon further review of the petition, the agency notes that the petitioner had requested use of the additive as a clarifying agent in high-propylene olefin copolymers in addition to its use in polypropylene films. Therefore, FDA is amending the filing notice of April 22, 1993, to state that the petitioner requested that the food additive regulations be amended to provide for the safe use of dimethyldibenzylidene sorbitol as a clarifying agent in polypropylene and high-propylene olefin copolymers for use in contact with food.</textblock>
    <textblock>The potential environmental impact of this action is being reviewed. To encourage public participation consistent with regulations promulgated under the National Environmental Policy Act (40 CFR 1501.4(b)), the agency is placing the environmental assessment submitted with the petition that is the subject of the notice on public display at the Dockets Management Branch (address above) for public review and comment. FDA will also place on public display any amendments to, or comments on, the petitioner's environmental assessment without further announcement in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. Interested persons may, on or before February 3, 1994, submit to the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written comments regarding this notice.

Received comments may be seen in the office above between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. If, based on its review, the agency finds that an environmental impact statement is not required and this petition results in a regulation, the notice of availability of the agency's finding of no significant impact and evidence supporting that finding will be published with the final regulation in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>in accordance with 21 CFR 25.40(c).</textblock>
