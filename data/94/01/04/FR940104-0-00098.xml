Objectives of a DSM plan shall be stated in terms of load profile adjustments by customer rate class and/or market segment. The benefit/cost analysis shall include the following steps:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Identification of objectives, alternatives, and effects;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Simulation of impacts on the system and its consumers, and the probable costs and benefits, including sensitivity/probability and scenario analysis; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Selection of DSM activities;</textblock>
    <textblock>(e) An outline of monitoring and reporting procedures to evaluate the performance of the implemented DSM plan;</textblock>

    <textblock>(2) Maintenance;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Environmental compliance;</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Capacity planning, including deferment of capacity and reliability of capacity;</textblock>
