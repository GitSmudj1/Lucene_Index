    <textblock>II. Public Reporting Burden</textblock>
    <textblock>The public reporting burden under FERC-592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines, as revised by Order Nos. 497-D and 636, is expected to remain unchanged. Currently, the reporting burden is estimated to average 9.94 hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Annual reporting requirements under FERC-592 are expected to total 7,882 hours, based on an estimated 793 responses from approximately 61 respondents.</textblock>
    <textblock>Issued concurrently with this order is a NOPR in Docket No. RM94-6-000.</textblock>
    <textblock>7</textblock>
    <textblock>The NOPR proposes to significantly reduce the FERC-592 information reporting requirements and burden. Extending the sunset date for FERC-592 through June 30, 1994, will give interested parties and the Commission time to evaluate the NOPR comments and allow the Commission time to prepare a final rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>Interested persons may send comments regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of this information collection, including suggestions for reductions to the reporting burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208-1415, FAX (202) 208-2425]. Comments on these reporting requirements may also be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, D.C. 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (202) 395-6880].</textblock>
    <textblock>Hard copy and/or electronic formats for any data collection required by this order may be obtained by contacting: La Dorn Systems Corporation, room 3308, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>On July 21, 1992, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued its opinion in</textblock>
    <textblock>Tenneco,</textblock>
    <textblock>upholding in substantial part Order Nos. 497 and 497-A. However, the court found that the Commission did not adequately justify its extension of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of §161.3(f) to gas sales and marketing information. The court stated that ``[o]n remand the Commission should reconsider its justification for applying [the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of §161.3(f)] to sales and marketing information and ensure that the final requirement is reasonably tailored to meet the Commission's goals of improving the market and benefitting consumers, as well as preventing undue discrimination.''</textblock>
    <textblock>8</textblock>
    <textblock>In a related matter, the court stated that ``[a]pplying [the contemporaneous disclosure requirement of §161.3(f)] to released-gas information prior to the issuance of Order No. 497-A might well be fundamentally unfair'' and that the Commission could avoid ``the expense of litigation over this issue by announcing that it will not retroactively apply [§161.3(f)] to released gas information.''</textblock>
    <textblock>9</textblock>
    <textblock>Further, in its review of</textblock>
    <textblock>Ozark,</textblock>
    <textblock>the court found that the Commission erred in finding Order No. 497 applicable to Ozark, a joint venture partnership composed of subsidiaries of four natural gas pipelines, each of which has a 25 percent ownership and voting interest. The court stated that the Commission failed to consider relevant evidence regarding the ability of the owner pipelines with affiliates to control the partnership.</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 4, 1992, in response to the court's opinion in</textblock>
    <textblock>Tenneco,</textblock>
    <textblock>the Commission issued Order No. 497-D, an order on remand and extending sunset date. Based upon the court's opinion, and in light of the structural changes in the gas industry that were to occur as a result of Order No. 636, the Commission revised §161.3(f) to narrow the scope of the contemporaneous disclosure requirement with respect to sales and marketing information. Under revised standard (f), pipelines are still required to contemporaneously disclose information related to transportation of natural gas. However, with respect to information related to gas sales or marketing, pipelines are only required to disclose information relating to sales or marketing on its system or the system of an affiliated pipeline. There are two categories of gas sales or marketing information that are not required to be contemporaneously disclosed: (1) Gas sales or marketing information that is available from public sources and (2) information related to gas sales off a pipeline's system, but not involving the system of an affiliated pipeline. Section 161.3(f) now reads:</textblock>
