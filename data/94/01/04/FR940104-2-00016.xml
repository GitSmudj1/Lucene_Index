    <textblock>On December 13, 1993, the Secretary of the Air Force determined that the service of the group known as ``U.S. Civilian Female Employees of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps While Serving in the Defense of Bataan and Corregidor During the Period January 2, 1942 to February 3, 1945'' shall be considered ``active duty'' under the provisions of Public Law 95-202 for the purposes of all laws administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).</textblock>
    <textblock>To be eligible for VA benefits, each member of the group must establish:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. They were employed as U.S. civilian female employees of the U.S. Army Nurse Corps (ANC), during the period January 2, 1942 to February 3, 1945, and</textblock>
    <textblock>2. When their employment began with the ANC, and</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Continuous employment prior to surrender of Corregidor to the Japanese on May 6, 1942, to gain recognition for the time spent in the civilian internment camps, and</textblock>
    <textblock>4. The date of release/escape from a civilian internment camp or termination date prior to Japanese internment.</textblock>
    <textblock>Application Procedures</textblock>
    <textblock>Before an individual can receive any VA benefits, the person must first apply for an Armed Forces Discharge Certificate by filling out a DD Form 2168 and sending it to the following address: US Army Reserve Personnel Center (DARP-VSE-N), 9700 Page Blvd, St. Louis, MO 6132-520.</textblock>
    <textblock>Important: Applicants must attach supporting documents to their DD Form 2168 application. Considered of primary importance will be any civilian employment records.</textblock>
    <textblock>Upon confirmation of an applicant's eligibility the DD-214 will be passed to the Awards and Decorations office to determine which ribbons the applicant is eligible to receive (campaign ribbons, theater ribbons, victory medal, etc.). Specific awards (i.e., Silver Star, Purple Heart, etc.) need separate justification detailing the act, achievement, or service believed to warrant the appropriate medal/ribbon.</textblock>
    <textblock>DD Forms 2168 are available from VA offices or from the U.S. Air Force offices in this notice.</textblock>
    <textblock>For further information contact Lt. Col. Robert Dunlap at the Secretary of the Air Force Personnel Council (AFPC), 1535 Command Drive-3d Floor-EE Wing, Andrews AFB, MD 20331-7002, telephone (301) 981-3504/5750.</textblock>
