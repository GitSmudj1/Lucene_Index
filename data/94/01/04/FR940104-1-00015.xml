    <textblock>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is proposing to amend its regulations governing standards of conduct and reporting requirements for transportation and affiliate transactions. The Commission is proposing to reduce the reporting requirements significantly based on changes in the way pipelines will be allocating capacity after implementation of Order No. 636</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>and the Commission's experience with the reporting requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Reporting Requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission estimates the public reporting burden for this collection of information under the proposed rule to average 66.2 hours per respondent, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The information will be collected under FERC-592, Marketing Affiliates of Interstate Pipelines. In lieu of being physically filed with the Commission on a periodic basis as a ``response'' or ``filing'', the data will be updated continuously and made available to customers/shippers, the public, and the Commission by Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs) established and maintained by the pipeline respondents pursuant to Order No. 636. The annual reporting burden for some 61 respondents under the proposed rule is estimated to total 4,038.2 hours.</textblock>
    <textblock>Because the proposed rule provides for fewer information items, the burden estimate for FERC-592 in the subject Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) represents a burden reduction of 63 hours per respondent_or a total reduction of 3,843 hours. The current annual reporting burden attributable to the FERC-592 information collection is 7,882 hours. A copy of this proposed rule is being provided to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).</textblock>
    <textblock>Interested persons may send comments regarding the burden estimates or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for further reductions of this burden, to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426 [Attention: Michael Miller, Information Services Division, (202) 208-1415, FAX (202) 208-2425]. Comments on the requirements of this proposed rule may also be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Washington, DC 20503 [Attention: Desk Officer for Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (202) 395-6880].</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission, in Order No. 497,</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>issued a rule intended to prevent pipelines from providing preferential treatment to their marketing or brokering affiliates. The rule adopted standards of conduct (codified at part 161 of the Commission's regulations)</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>and tariff and reporting requirements (codified in §250.16).</textblock>
    <textblock>4</textblock>
    <textblock>The reporting requirements required the pipelines to file FERC Form No. 592, a log containing information relating to transportation for affiliated marketers, and to maintain the same information for nonaffiliated shippers. The Commission imposed a sunset provision requiring a reevaluation of the requirements of the rule within one year to determine whether increased competition in transportation had mitigated the concerns about affiliate abuse. The Commission has extended the sunset provision until December 31, 1993, and, contemporaneously with this NOPR, is issuing Order No. 497-E which extends the reporting requirements until June 30, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>5</textblock>
    <textblock>In Order No. 636, the Commission created a new operating environment for interstate pipelines and shippers by requiring pipelines to unbundle their sale of gas from their transportation service and implementing changes in the terms and conditions for providing transportation. One of the principal changes introduced by Order No. 636 was the initiation of capacity release mechanisms through which firm shippers can release their firm transportation capacity, including storage capacity, to others wanting to obtain the capacity. The Commission mandated that all allocations of firm capacity, both firm capacity available from the pipeline and released capacity, be implemented through Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs) operated by the pipelines (or operated on their behalf by third parties). The Commission also has begun the process, in Docket No. RM93-4-000, of standardizing the methods by which pipelines will provide information about available capacity through their EBBs.</textblock>
