    <textblock>You do not cooperate with us</textblock>
    <textblock>. If there is a question</textblock>
    <textblock>about whether you continue to be disabled and we ask you to give</textblock>
    <textblock>us medical or other evidence or to go for a physical or mental</textblock>
    <textblock>examination by a certain date, we will find that your disability</textblock>
    <textblock>has ended if you fail, without good cause, to do what we ask.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 404.911 explains the factors we consider and how we will</textblock>
    <textblock>determine generally whether you have good cause for failure to</textblock>
    <textblock>cooperate. In addition, §404.1518 discusses how we determine</textblock>
    <textblock>whether you have good cause for failing to attend a consultative</textblock>
    <textblock>examination. The month in which your disability ends will be the</textblock>
    <textblock>first month in which you failed to do what we asked.</textblock>

    <textblock>educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of</textblock>
    <textblock>facility with the English language) the individual may have which</textblock>
    <textblock>may have caused the individual's failure to cooperate.</textblock>
