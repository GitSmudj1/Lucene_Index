    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations in 7 CFR part 340, ``Introduction of Organisms and Products Altered or Produced Through Genetic Engineering Which Are Plant Pests or Which There Is Reason to Believe Are Plant Pests,'' require a person to obtain a permit before introducing (importing, moving interstate, or releasing into the environment) into the United States certain genetically engineered organisms and products that are considered ``regulated articles.'' The regulations set forth procedures for obtaining a permit for the release into the environment of a regulated article, and for obtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to these regulations, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has received and is reviewing the following applications for permits to release genetically engineered organisms into the environment:</textblock>
