    <textblock>The Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act 1994, (approved October 28, 1993, Public Law 103-124) (94 App. Act) made $6.5 million available for the HBCU Program in FY 1994. The Department is also making an additional $2 million of FY 1993 HBCU funds eligible for program applicants.</textblock>
    <textblock>Because of the large number of applications anticipated for funding under the FY 1993 NOFA, and to make the FY 1994 funds available as soon as possible, the Department is combining the FY 1993 and 1994 funds into a single competition under this Notice. All of the applications received for the FY 1993 NOFA will be considered for funding from this combined pool of $13,000,000.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, the Department is extending the application due date to 4:30 p.m. on February 11, 1994, to give additional applicants an opportunity to apply for funding under this program. However, applicants who have already submitted an application may not submit an additional application.</textblock>
    <textblock>The total of $13,000,000 announced as available in this Notice will be awarded under the same terms set forth in the FY 1993 NOFA, cited above (September 17, 1993, 58 FR 48716).</textblock>
