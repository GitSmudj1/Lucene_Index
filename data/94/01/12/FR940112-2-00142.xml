    <textblock>Eligibility</textblock>
    <textblock>Eligible applicants for these projects are state technology extension programs operated by state governments, or on behalf of state governments by private or public non-profit organizations. All states will be eligible, regardless of state size, industrial density/sparseness, or number of existing industrial assistance programs. States that have received previous planning grants remain eligible for additional Program Planning projects.

One proposal for Program Planning will be accepted per state.</textblock>
