    <textblock>Take notice that on January 3, 1994 Ozark Gas Transmission System (Ozark) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1 the following tariff sheet, with a proposed effective date of February 2, 1994:</textblock>
    <textblock>Seventh Revised Tariff Sheet No. 4.</textblock>
    <textblock>Ozark states that the filing is a general rate case submitted principally to comply with the terms of Ozark's settlement in Docket No. RP84-53. The filing reflects a base period encompassing the twelve months ending October 31, 1993, adjusted for known and measurable changes through the nine month period ending July 31, 1994. Ozark states that the filing utilizes straight fixed-variable rate design, the Ozark method of calculating an equity only rate base, and projected ITS throughput of 10,000 Dth. The proposed changes would decrease Ozark's cost of service by approximately $65,856 compared to the cost of service approved by the Commission in Docket No. RS92-72.</textblock>
    <textblock>Ozark states that copies of the filing were served upon Ozark's jurisdictional customers and interested state regulatory agencies.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with §§385.214 and 385.211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure. All such motions and protests should be filed on or before January 13, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection in the public reference room.</textblock>
