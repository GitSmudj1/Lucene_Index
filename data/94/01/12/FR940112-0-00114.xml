    <textblock>B. Section 500.6␣Net Quantity of Contents Declaration, Location</textblock>
    <textblock>This section relates to the technical requirements to be followed in the presentation of the declaration of contents. There are several amendments to subsection (b). First, the words ``or mass'' are added after the word ``weight.'' This addition is made necessary by the metric amendments to section 4(a)(2) of the FPLA, which state that the quantity of contents shall be ``in terms of weight or mass, measure or numerical count.''</textblock>
    <textblock>15</textblock>
    <textblock>The same addition is made in each of the regulations that refer to weight so that they uniformly read ``weight or mass.''</textblock>
    <textblock>An example of an improper metric qualifier, i.e., ``giant liter,'' has been added to the existing examples of improper inch/pound qualifiers. This example should aid in the preparation of labels. Further, the amendment includes a parenthetical metric size descriptor in addition to the existing inch/pound size reference.</textblock>
    <textblock>The amendment to this section allows the use of the ``e'' mark as part of the statement of the net quantity of contents. Without the change, the ``e'' mark could be considered an improper qualifier and its use violative of the regulations.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission received two comments relating to the use of the ``e'' mark. The Michigan State Department of Agriculture commented that the use of the ``e'' mark as part of the statement of quantity of contents is appropriate.</textblock>
    <textblock>16</textblock>
    <textblock>NCWM commented on the placement of the ``e'' mark.</textblock>
    <textblock>17</textblock>
    <textblock>The amendment proposed by the Commission reads:</textblock>
    <textblock>When used, the ``e'' mark shall be at least 3 millimeters</textblock>
    <textblock>(0.118 inches) in height and shall appear immediately</textblock>
    <textblock>after the metric portion of the net quantity of</textblock>
    <textblock>contents statement.</textblock>
    <textblock>NCWM suggests the following alternative:</textblock>
    <textblock>When used, the ``e'' mark shall be at least 3 millimeters</textblock>
    <textblock>in height and shall be placed in the same field of</textblock>
    <textblock>vision as the quantity of contents statement.</textblock>
    <textblock>NCWM states that the reason for its suggested change is consistency with the law in the European Community and to avoid having the FTC impose specific placement requirements on the ``e'' mark.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission agrees that the Commission rules should be flexible enough to allow companies to meet both the Commission requirements and other reasonable variations, and that specific placement requirements prevent flexibility. However, the Commission is not persuaded that use of the phrase ``in the same field of vision'' is appropriate. While this terminology may be a term of art in the European Community, it is doubtful that many American companies, especially small businesses, would understand its meaning. Accordingly, the amendments refrain from using the phrase ``in the same field of vision'' and avoid requiring a precise placement of the ``e'' mark, although they permit the use of the ``e'' mark as part of the statement of the net quantity of contents. The Commission has amended the subject sentence in Subsection (b) to read:</textblock>
    <textblock>When used, the ``e'' mark shall be at least 3 millimeters</textblock>
    <textblock>(approx. 1/8 inch) in height.</textblock>
    <textblock>18</textblock>
    <textblock>C. Section 500.7␣Net Quantity of Contents, Method of Expression</textblock>
    <textblock>The only change to this section is the addition of ``or mass'' each time the term ``weight'' is used.</textblock>
    <textblock>D. Section 500.8␣Units of Weight or Mass and Measure</textblock>
    <textblock>This section specifies the measurement units which must be used in making the content disclosure statements. The amendments to this section implement the 1992 metric amendments to FPLA by specifying the SI metric units which must be used in dual declaration statements. Neither the amendments to the FPLA nor the Commission's regulations require that the measurement systems be used in a particular order.</textblock>
    <textblock>19</textblock>
    <textblock>Thus, manufacturers have discretion to put SI metric units first or customary inch/pound units first as they so choose.</textblock>

    <textblock>NIST commented that the use of an inch declaration to three decimal places (the .118 inches used in the proposed amendment) was ``superfluous.'' NIST, 12, 3. The Commission adopts NIST's suggestion to use ``approx. 1/8 in.'' in the sentence.</textblock>

    <textblock>Section 4(a)(2) of the 1992 amendments to the FPLA states that the quantity of contents shall be stated using units ``*␣*␣* of both the customary inch/pound system *␣*␣* and *␣*␣* the SI metric system.'' While the inch/pound system precedes the term SI metric in this phrase, there is little reason to infer a Congressional intent that this also be the order in which quantities are disclosed. The amended rules therefore leave this choice to manufacturers and distributors.</textblock>
