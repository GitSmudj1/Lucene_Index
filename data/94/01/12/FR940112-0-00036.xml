    <textblock>16. Section 404.1579 is amended by revising the section</textblock>
    <textblock>heading and by revising paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) to read as</textblock>
    <textblock>follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§404.1579</textblock>
    <textblock>How we will determine whether your disability</textblock>
    <textblock>continues or ends.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(e)␣*␣*␣*</textblock>
    <textblock>(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>A prior determination or decision was fraudulently</textblock>
    <textblock>obtained</textblock>
    <textblock>. If we find that any prior favorable determination or</textblock>
    <textblock>decision was obtained by fraud, we may find that you are not</textblock>
    <textblock>disabled. In addition, we may reopen your claim under the rules</textblock>
    <textblock>in §404.988. In determining whether a prior favorable</textblock>
    <textblock>determination or decision was fraudulently obtained, we will take</textblock>
    <textblock>into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic</textblock>
    <textblock>limitations (including any lack of facility with the English</textblock>
    <textblock>language) which you may have had at the time.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>You do not cooperate with us</textblock>
    <textblock>. If there is a question</textblock>
    <textblock>about whether you continue to be disabled and we ask you to give</textblock>
    <textblock>us medical or other evidence or to go for a physical or mental</textblock>
    <textblock>examination by a certain date, we will find that your disability</textblock>
    <textblock>has ended if you fail, without good cause, to do what we ask.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 404.911 explains the factors we consider and how we will</textblock>
    <textblock>determine generally whether you have good cause for failure to</textblock>
    <textblock>cooperate. In addition, §404.1518 discusses how we determine</textblock>
    <textblock>whether you have good cause for failing to attend a consultative</textblock>
    <textblock>examination. The month in which your disability ends will be the</textblock>
    <textblock>first month in which you failed to do what we asked.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>17. Section 404.1586 is amended by revising paragraph (d) to</textblock>
    <textblock>read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§404.1586</textblock>
    <textblock>Why and when we will stop your cash benefits.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(d)</textblock>
    <textblock>If you do not cooperate with us</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>If we ask you to give us medical or other evidence or to go for a</textblock>
    <textblock>medical examination by a certain date, we will find that your</textblock>
    <textblock>disability has ended if you fail, without good cause, to do what</textblock>
    <textblock>we ask. Section 404.911 explains the factors we consider and how</textblock>
    <textblock>we will determine generally whether you have good cause for</textblock>
    <textblock>failure to cooperate. In addition, §404.1518 discusses how we</textblock>
    <textblock>determine whether you have good cause for failing to attend a</textblock>
    <textblock>consultative examination. The month in which your disability</textblock>
    <textblock>will be found to have ended will be the month in which you failed</textblock>
    <textblock>to do what we asked.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>18. Section 404.1594 is amended by revising the section</textblock>
    <textblock>heading and by revising paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) to read as</textblock>
    <textblock>follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§404.1594</textblock>
    <textblock>How we will determine whether your disability</textblock>
    <textblock>continues or ends.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
