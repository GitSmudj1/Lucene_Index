    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Federal Trade Commission (the ``Commission'' or ``FTC'') amends its regulations issued under section 4 of the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) to require the use of the units of both the customary inch/pound measurement system and the metric measurement system in the net quantity statement for certain consumer commodities. This action is being taken to implement 1992 amendments to the FPLA, which require such dual measurement system disclosure.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Statement of Basis and Purpose</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Introduction</textblock>
    <textblock>In 1967, Congress enacted the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (15 U.S.C. 1451</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq</textblock>
    <textblock>.) (FPLA). Congress declared that packages and their labels should be marked to enable consumers to obtain accurate information as to the quantity of the contents and to facilitate value comparisons.</textblock>
    <textblock>To effectuate its policy of providing consumers accurate quantity information on commodity labels, Congress in the FPLA set out general disclosure requirements and delegated to various agencies, including the FTC, the duty of promulgating regulations. The FTC in 1968 published regulations that provided detailed guidance to industry on what to include in statements of identity of products; in the identification of manufacturers, packers, or distributors; and in declarations of net quantities (33 FR 4718, March 19, 1968; 16 CFR part 500).</textblock>
    <textblock>The 1967 FPLA specified that the quantity disclosures be made in the customary American inch/pound system of measurement. The FTC's implementing regulations thus required use of the inch/pound system of measurement. The FTC regulations, however, also permitted the use of the metric system of measurement as an additional net quantity disclosure (16 CFR 500.21).</textblock>
