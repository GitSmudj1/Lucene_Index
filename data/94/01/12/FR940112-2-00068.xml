    <textblock>OMB No.:</textblock>

    <textblock>Description:</textblock>
    <textblock>This information collection is required by Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, Federal regulations and issuances made by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Service for the purpose of enforcing the support obligations owed by absent parents to their children and the spouse (or former spouse) with whom such children are living, locating absent parents, establishing paternity, obtaining child and spousal support, and assuring that assistance in obtaining support will be available to all children.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has designated the Director of the Office of Child Support Enforcement at the Administration for Children and Families, among other things, to establish such standards for State programs for locating absent parents, establishing paternity, and obtaining child support and support for the spouse (or former spouse), and to review and approve State plans for such programs. A State must submit a State plan for a program of support collection and establishment of paternity under Title IV-D of the Social Security Act. The information obtained on the State plan preprint will serve as a contract between the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) and any State specifying activities the State must perform as required by law and other Federal requirements as a condition for Federal financial participation.</textblock>
