    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the Energy and Water Use Rule, each required label on a covered appliance must show a range, or scale, indicating the range of energy costs or efficiencies for all models of a size or capacity comparable to the labeled model. This notice publishes the new range figures, which, under §§305.10, 305.11 and 305.14 of the rule, must be used on labels on refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers manufactured on and after April 12, 1994, and in advertising of refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers in catalogs printed after April 12, 1994. Properly labeled refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers manufactured prior to the effective date need not be relabeled. Catalogs printed prior to the effective date in accordance with 16 CFR 305.14 need not be revised.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 19, 1979, the Commission issued a final rule,</textblock>
    <textblock>pursuant to section 324 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act of 1975,</textblock>
    <textblock>covering certain appliance categories, including refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers. The rule requires that energy costs and related information be disclosed on labels and in retail sales catalogs for all refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers and freezers presently manufactured. Certain point-of-sale promotional materials must disclose the availability of energy usage information. If a refrigerator, refrigerator-freezer or freezer is advertised in a catalog from which it may be purchased by cash, charge account or credit terms, then the range of estimated annual energy costs for the product must be included on each page of the catalog that lists the product. The required disclosures and all claims concerning energy consumption made in writing or in broadcast advertisements must be based on the results of test procedures developed by the Department of Energy, which are referenced in the rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 305.8(b) of the rule requires manufacturers, after filing an initial report, to report estimated annual operating cost or energy efficiency annually by specified dates for each product type.</textblock>
    <textblock>Because the costs for the various types of energy change yearly, and because manufacturers regularly add new models to their lines, improve existing models and drop others, the data base from which the ranges of comparability are calculated is constantly changing.</textblock>
    <textblock>To keep the required information in line with these changes, the Commission is empowered, under §305.10 of the rule, to publish new ranges (but not more often than annually) if an analysis of the new data indicates that the upper or lower limits of the ranges have changed by more than 15%.</textblock>
    <textblock>The new figures for the estimated annual costs of operation for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers, which were calculated using the 1993 representative average energy cost for electricity (8.30 cents per kilowatt-hour) published by DOE on January 5, 1993,</textblock>
    <textblock>have been submitted and have been analyzed by the Commission. New ranges based upon them are herewith published.</textblock>

    <textblock>44 FR 66466. On December 10, 1987 (52 FR 46888), the Commission amended the Appliance Labeling Rule by extending coverage to include central air conditioners and heat pumps. On October 25, 1993 (58 FR 54955), the Commission extended the Rule's coverage to include certain plumbing products (showerheads, faucets, water closets and urinals).</textblock>
