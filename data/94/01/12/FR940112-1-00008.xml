    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This notice proposes to modify the current Class D airspace at Hood Army Airfield (AAF) and Robert Gray AAF, and to establish Class E airspace at Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, TX. The current Class D airspace encompasses Killeen Municipal Airport and with airspace reclassification, aircraft operators at Killeen Municipal Airport are now required to establish two-way radio communication with Hood AAF Air Traffic Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) or when Hood AAF ATCT is closed, Robert Gray AAF ATCT. This notice proposes to remove the airspace surrounding Killeen Municipal Airport from Hood AAF's Class D airspace and to establish Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to maintain adequate Class D airspace and two-way radio communications at Hood AAF and Robert Gray AAF, to remove Killeen Municipal Airport, TX, from the current Class D airspace, and to establish Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, TX.</textblock>

    <textblock>The Proposal</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify Class D airspace at Hood AAF and Robert Gray AAF, TX, and to establish Class E airspace at Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, TX. This modification has been requested by both the operators of Hood AAF and the operators of Killeen Municipal Airport. The proposal would remove that portion of current Class D airspace which surrounds Killeen Municipal Airport and would establish Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport. The intended effect of this proposal is to maintain adequate Class D airspace and two-way radio communications to contain instrument flight rule (IFR) operations at Hood AAF and Robert Gray AAF, TX, to remove Killeen Municipal Airport from the Class D airspace, and to establish Class E airspace at Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, Texas.</textblock>
    <textblock>The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace designations are published in Paragraph 5000 and Class E airspace areas designated as surface areas for airports are published in Paragraph 6002 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D and Class E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.</textblock>
