    <textblock>The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (the Commission) has issued Amendment No. 4 to Material License No. SNM-2503 held by Duke Power Company for the receipt and storage of spent fuel at the Oconee Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installation (ISFSI), located on the Oconee Nuclear Station site, Oconee County, South Carolina. This amendment is effective as of the date of issuance.</textblock>
    <textblock>The amendment revises section 5.4.1 of the Technical Specification regarding the concrete density of Horizontal Storage Module (HSM) from ``a minimum of 145 pounds per cubic foot'' to ``a minimum of 140 pounds per cubic foot.'' This amendment does not affect fuel receipt, handling, and storage safety.</textblock>
    <textblock>The application for this amendment complies with the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the license amendment. Prior public notice of the amendment was not required since the amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission has determined that the issuance of the amendment will not result in any significant environmental impact and that, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(c)(11), an environmental assessment need not be prepared in connection with issuance of the amendment.</textblock>
    <textblock>For further details with respect to this action, see (1) the application for amendment dated March 9, 1993, as supplemented by letter dated November 16, 1993; (2) Amendment No. 4 to Materials license No. SNM-2503; and (3) the Commission's letter to the licensee dated January 5, 1994. All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public Document Room, The Gelman Building, Lower Level, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, and the Oconee County Library, 501 W. South Broad Street, Walhalla, SC 29691.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 5th day of January 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</textblock>
