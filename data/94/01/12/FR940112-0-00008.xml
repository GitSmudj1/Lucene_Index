    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This action amends the Blanding, Utah, Class E airspace. Controlled airspace extending from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) is necessary for a new instrument approach procedure and missed approach holding pattern at Blanding Municipal Airport, Blanding, Utah. Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' replacing it with the designation ``Class E airspace.'' The airspace will be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>History</textblock>
    <textblock>On October 1, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) by amending the Blanding, Utah, Class E Airspace (58 FR 51256). Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received.</textblock>
    <textblock>Airspace reclassification, in effect as of September 16, 1993, has discontinued the use of the term ``transition area,'' and airspace extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth is now Class E airspace. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Rule</textblock>
    <textblock>This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the Class E airspace at Blanding, Utah, to provide controlled airspace for aircraft executing a new instrument approach procedure and missed approach holding pattern at Blanding Municipal Airport, Blanding, Utah.</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</textblock>
