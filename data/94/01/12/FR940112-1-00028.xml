    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document contains proposed Income Tax Regulations relating to the determination of combined taxable income under the profit split method. These regulations would amend the current regulations and provide revised rules in order for taxpayers to compute the combined taxable income under profit split when the possession product chosen for purposes of section 936(h)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code is a component product or an end-product form. These regulations are necessary to provide guidance to taxpayers electing the profit split method of computing taxable income under section 936(h)(5).</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>This document contains proposed amendments to the Income Tax Regulations (26 CFR part 1) under section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. These amendments to the regulations are proposed to provide simplified rules for computing combined taxable income under the profit split method for a taxpayer that has chosen a component product or an end-product form as its possession product.</textblock>
    <textblock>Explanation of Provisions</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed regulations would amend ยง1.936-6(b)(1),</textblock>
    <textblock>Q &amp; A. 12,</textblock>
    <textblock>with conforming changes made to</textblock>
    <textblock>Q &amp; A. 10, A. 11, and A. 13.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the proposed revision, where the possession product is a component product or an end-product form, the combined taxable income attributable to the possession product will be determined by multiplying the combined taxable income of the possession corporation and affiliated groups derived from covered sales of integrated products (which includes the possession product) by a production cost ratio. In the case of a component product, the combined taxable income of the integrated product would be multiplied by a ratio, the numerator of which equals the production costs of the component product and the denominator of which equals the production costs of the integrated product. The combined taxable income of an end-product form is determined in a similar manner using the production costs of the end-product form.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed change is intended to simplify the computation of combined taxable income under</textblock>
    <textblock>Q &amp; A. 12</textblock>
    <textblock>and to eliminate the need to apply section 482 in cases in which a possession product is a component product or an end-product form. No inference is intended as to the interpretation or scope of current regulations by the revisions proposed herein.</textblock>
    <textblock>The example under ยง1.936-6(b)(1),</textblock>
    <textblock>Q &amp; A. 12</textblock>
    <textblock>is modified to reflect the revised rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>Proposed Effective Date</textblock>
    <textblock>The changes made in this document are proposed to be effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1993.</textblock>
