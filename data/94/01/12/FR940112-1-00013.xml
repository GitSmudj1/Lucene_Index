    <textblock>Any person may obtain a copy of this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) by submitting a request to the Federal Aviation Administration, System Management Branch, ANM-530, 1601 Lind Avenue, SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056. Communications must identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in being placed on mailing list for future NPRM's should also request a copy of Advisory Circular No. 11-2A, which describes the application procedure.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Proposal</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the class E airspace at Lakeview, Oregon, to accommodate a new instrument approach procedure at the Lake County, Airport. The area would be depicted on aeronautical charts for pilot reference. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace designations for airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The class E airspace designations listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</textblock>
