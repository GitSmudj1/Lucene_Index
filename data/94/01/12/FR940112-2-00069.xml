    <textblock>Faculty Loan Repayment Program</textblock>
    <textblock>The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) announces that</textblock>
    <textblock>applications for fiscal year (FY) 1994, for the Disadvantaged Health Professions Faculty Loan Repayment Program (FLRP) are now being accepted under section 738 (a) of the Public Health Service Act (The Act), as amended by the Health Professions Education Extension Amendments of 1992, Public Law 102-408, dated October 13, 1992.</textblock>
    <textblock>In FY 1994, approximately $800,000 is available for competing applications for the Disadvantaged Health Professions Faculty Loan Repayment Program. It is expected that 26 awards averaging $30,000 ($15,000 per year for two years) will be supported with these funds.</textblock>
    <textblock>Previous Funding Experience</textblock>
    <textblock>Previous funding experience information is provided to assist potential applicants to make better informed decisions regarding submission of an application for this program. In fiscal years 1991, 1992 and 1993, a total of 91 awards, averaging $24,000 ($12,000 per year for 2 years) were made.</textblock>
    <textblock>Purpose</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of the Disadvantaged Health Professions Faculty Loan Repayment Program (FLRP) is to attract disadvantaged health professions faculty members for accredited health professions schools. The program provides a financial incentive for degree-trained health professions personnel from disadvantaged backgrounds who will serve as members of the faculties of those schools. The FLRP is directed at those individuals available to serve immediately or within a short time as ``new'' full-time faculty members.</textblock>
    <textblock>Loan repayment may be provided only for an individual who has</textblock>
    <textblock>not</textblock>
    <textblock>been a member of the faculty of any school at any time during the 18-month period preceding the date on which the Secretary receives the request of the individual for a repayment contract (i.e., ``new'' faculty).</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 738(b) makes available grants and contracts with schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, podiatric medicine, pharmacy, public health, health administration, clinical psychology and other public or private nonprofit health or educational entities to assist in increasing the number of underrepresented minority faculty. Section 738(b) will be implemented as a separate program.</textblock>
    <textblock>Eligible Individuals</textblock>
    <textblock>Individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds are eligible to compete for participation in the FLRP if they:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Have a degree in medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry,</textblock>
    <textblock>nursing, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, optometry, veterinary</textblock>
    <textblock>medicine, public health or clinical psychology; or</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Are enrolled in an approved graduate training program in one</textblock>
    <textblock>of the health professions listed above; or</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Are enrolled as a full-time student in the final year of health</textblock>
    <textblock>professions training, leading to a degree from an eligible school.</textblock>
    <textblock>Established faculty members are not eligible to apply for funds under the FLRP. Only individuals that have not taught in the last 18 (eighteen) months prior to application to the program will be considered.</textblock>
    <textblock>Statutory Requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>Prior to submitting an application, eligible individuals must sign a contract, as prescribed by the Secretary, setting forth the terms and conditions of the FLRP. This contract requires the individual to have entered into a contract with an eligible school to serve as a full-time member of the faculty, as determined by the school, for not less than 2 years, whereby the school agrees to pay, for each year, a sum (in addition to faculty salary) equal to that paid by the Secretary towards the repayment of principal due on the applicant's health professions educational loans. Additionally, the individual involved may not have been a member of the faculty of any school at any time during the last 18 months prior to application to the program.</textblock>
    <textblock>Eligible Schools</textblock>
    <textblock>Eligible health professions schools are public or nonprofit private accredited schools of medicine, osteopathic medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, podiatric medicine, optometry, veterinary medicine or public health, or schools that offer graduate programs in clinical psychology and which are located in States as provided in section 799 of the Act. Schools of nursing are also eligible, as defined in section 853 of the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>Provisions of the Loan Repayment Program</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 738 (a) authorizes repayment, for any year for which repayments are made, not to exceed 20 percent of the outstanding principal and interest on the individual's educational loans. Of the repayment, the Secretary pays half, up to $20,000. The school pays an equal amount, unless the Secretary determines that the repayment will impose an undue financial hardship on the school in which case, the Secretary may pay up to the entire 20 percent.</textblock>
    <textblock>The school is required, for each such year, to make payments of principal and interest in an amount equal to the amount of payment made by the Secretary for that year. These payments must be in addition to the faculty salary the participant otherwise would receive.</textblock>
    <textblock>Allowable educational loan repayment expenses include the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Tuition expenses;</textblock>
    <textblock>2. All other reasonable educational expenses such as fees, books,</textblock>
    <textblock>supplies, educational equipment and materials required by the school, and incurred by the applicant;</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Reasonable living expenses, as determined by the Secretary; and</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Partial payments of the increased Federal income tax liability</textblock>
    <textblock>caused by the FLRP's payments and considered to be ``other income,'' if the recipient requests such assistance.</textblock>
    <textblock>Prior to entering into an agreement for repayment of loans, the Secretary requires satisfactory evidence of the existence and reasonableness of the individual's educational loans, including a copy of the original written loan agreement establishing the outstanding educational loan.</textblock>
    <textblock>Waiver Provision</textblock>
    <textblock>In the event of undue financial hardship to a school, the school may obtain from the Secretary a waiver of its share of payments while the participant is serving under the terms of the contract. For purposes of this program, ``undue financial hardship'', as seen by the Secretary, is based on a school's particular financial status as influenced by such circumstances as budget cutbacks. Decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, and may</textblock>
    <textblock>be supported by the school's documentation of comparative yearly financial allocation of funds; or the most current certified public accounting audit, including the Balance Sheet and Statement of Income and Expenses for the past several years.</textblock>
    <textblock>If the Secretary waives the school's payment requirement, the amount of the Federal loan repayment may be up to the full 20 percent described above (regardless of the ``equal amount'' provision described above), but cannot exceed the $20,000 repayment limit. The participant must pay that portion of loan payment due which is not covered.</textblock>
    <textblock>The following Definitions, Program Requirements, Review Criteria and Funding Preference were established in FY 1991 after public comment dated October 2, 1991, at 56 FR 49896, and the Secretary is extending them in FY 1994.</textblock>
