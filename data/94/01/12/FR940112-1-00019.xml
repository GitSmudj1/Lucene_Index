  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule would notify Federal Airways V-93 and V-451 located in Maine. Modifying V-93 and V-451 is necessary because a section of both airways is defined by radials from the Navy Brunswick, ME, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range/Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) facility. Navy Brunswick VORTAC is scheduled to be decommissioned on April 28, 1994, and the effective date of the final rule, if issued would coincide with that date.</textblock>

    <textblock>The Proposal</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to modify V-93 and V-451. A section of both airways is defined by radials from the Navy Brunswick, ME (NHZ) VORTAC which is scheduled to be decommissioned on April 28, 1994. This action would ensure that the airways are usable after the navigational aid has been decommissioned. This proposed action would be come effective concurrent with the decommissioning of the Navy Brunswick VORTAC. Domestic VOR Federal airways are published in paragraph 6010(a) of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The airways listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</textblock>
