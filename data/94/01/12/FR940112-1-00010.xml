    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This notice proposes to establish Class D airspace at Friedman Memorial Airport, Hailey, Idaho. Midwest ATC Service, Inc., operates a control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport with an associated airport traffic area. Airspace Reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and eliminated those ATA's not already designated to become Class D airspace. As a result, the requirement for two-way radio communication with the control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport lapsed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain instrument flight rules (IFR) operations and continue the two-way radio communication requirement at Friedman Memorial Airport.</textblock>

    <textblock>The Proposal</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class D airspace at Friedman Memorial Airport, Hailey, Idaho. Midwest ATC Service, Inc., operates a control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport with an associated airport traffic area (ATA). Airspace reclassification, which became effective September 16, 1993, discontinued the use of the term ``airport traffic area'' and, for control zones with operating control towers, replaced it with the designation ``Class D airspace.'' Only ATA's already designated to become Class D airspace continued to exist; Friedman Memorial Airport was not so designated. As a result, the requirement for two-way radio communication with the control tower at Friedman Memorial Airport lapsed. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class D airspace to contain IFR operations and continue the two-way communication requirement at Friedman Memorial Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class D airspace is published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A, dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 as of September 16, 1993 (58 FR 36398; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace listed in the document would be published subsequently in the Order.</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</textblock>
