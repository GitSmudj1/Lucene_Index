    <textblock>Self-Regulatory Organizations; Delta Government Options Corp.; Order Approving a Proposed Rule Change Relating to Permissible Forms of Margin Deposits</textblock>
    <textblock>January 4, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>On February 12, 1991, Delta Government Options Corp. (``Delta'') filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposed rule change pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'')</textblock>
    <textblock>relating to the acceptance of U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds as margin. On March 23, 1991, the Commission published notice of the proposed rule change in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>to solicit comments from interested persons.</textblock>
    <textblock>One comment letter was received in response to which</textblock>
    <textblock>Delta amended its proposal on April 25, 1991.</textblock>
    <textblock>On September 8, 1993, Delta submitted a second amendment concerning the participation of registered investment companies.</textblock>
    <textblock>As discussed below, the Commission is approving Delta's proposal as amended.</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Description</textblock>
    <textblock>Delta's proposal expands the permissible forms of margin by permitting participants to deposit not only Fed Funds</textblock>
    <textblock>but also U.S. Treasury bills with a remaining term to maturity of 365 days or less and Treasury securities which would be deliverable by a participant if an option contract written by the participant was exercised and assigned to the participant (i.e., ``cover).</textblock>
    <textblock>Treasury bills deposited as margin will be valued for purposes of determining the amount of margin on deposit with Delta as 100% of the lesser of their par value or their market value. Deposits of Treasury bills as margin must be made in principal amounts of $50,000 and integral multiples thereof.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the event that Treasury bills deposited as margin mature while on deposit with Delta, Delta will hold the cash proceeds as margin and will invest them in accordance with its rules governing the investment of cash margin deposits.</textblock>
    <textblock>If a participant that is an employee benefit plan (i.e., pension plan) subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (``ERISA'')</textblock>
    <textblock>deposits Treasury bills as margin, Delta will monitor the maturity date of such Treasury bills and will require the pension plan to substitute collateral prior to the maturity of the Treasury bills.</textblock>

    <textblock>The one comment letter, submitted by The First Boston Corporation (``First Boston''), generally supported Delta's proposal because it believed the acceptance of Treasury bills as margin would increase the competitiveness and usefulness of Delta and would not infuse any additional credit risk into the settlement system. First Boston noted, however, that pursuant to Delta's original proposal (1) deposits of Treasury bills as margin would have to be made in principal amounts of $500,000 and integral multiples thereof and (2) where the margin was deposited in the form of Treasury bills, excess margin of less than $500,000 would not be automatically returned to participants. First Boston stated that these $500,000 minimums were unreasonably high and would reduce needlessly the utility of using Treasury bills as margin. Letter from Scott H. Rockoff, Vice President, Regulatory Reporting and Analysis, First Boston, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, Commission (April 15, 1991). In response, Delta amended its proposal so that the deposit and automatic return minimums are $50,000. Delta also added a provision to the proposal whereby participants can waive their rights to receive on a daily basis excess margin. Participants have an unqualified right to withdraw such a waiver at any time during business hours. Letter from Robert C. Mendelson, Morgan, Lewis and Bockius (Counsel for Delta), to Ross Pazzol, Esq., Division of Market Regulation (``Division''), Commission (April 24, 1991) and letter from David J. Maloy, President, Delta, to Sonia Burnett, Esq., Division, Commission (December 3, 1993).</textblock>

    <textblock>When Delta filed the original proposal, its rules permitted investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``1940 Act''), 15 U.S.C. 80a (1990), to be participants. Accordingly, the original proposal would have allowed investment companies to deposit with their custodian banks that hold margin for the benefit of Delta Treasury bills, notes, and bonds as margin. Staff of the Commission's Division of Investment Management (``IM'') raised concerns relating to Delta's custody and control of investment companies' securities deposited as margin. In response, Delta amended the proposal to prohibit participation in Delta by registered investment companies. Delta intends to remove the participation prohibition at such time as Delta and Commission staff determine the conditions under which investment companies may become participants. Letter from David J. Maloy, President, Delta, to Julia Ulstrup, Senior Counsel, IM, Commission (September 8, 1993).</textblock>

    <textblock>Pursant to Delta's procedures, margin deposited in the form of Fed Funds (i.e., cash) can be invested in overnight repurchase agreements that require as collateral the delivery of Treasury bills with maturities not to exceed 180 days from the date of the repurchase agreement.

    <textblock>Letter from Robert C. Mendelson, Esq., Morgan, Lewis &amp; Bockius (Counsel for Delta), to Ross Pazzol, Esq., Division, Commission (April 24, 1991). Under section 1002(21) of ERISA, a person that exercises discretionary authority or control over the assets of an employee benefit plan is deemed to be a plan fiduciary and is required to act solely in the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries and exclusively to provide benefits to these participants and beneficiaries. Because such fiduciary responsibilities may interfere and potentially conflict with Delta's obligations to its participants as a registered clearing agency, Delta is implementing a special procedure for handling margin deposited by pension plans to avoid this potential ERISA problem. Furthermore, as explained in greater detail in Section II of this order, the Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration of the Department of Labor has granted an exemption for certain transactions involving Delta that facilitates the participation of employee benefit plans in Delta.</textblock>
