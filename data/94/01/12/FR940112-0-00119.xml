    <textblock>L. Section 500.16␣Measurement of Container Type Commodities, How Expressed</textblock>
    <textblock>Formerly §500.15a, the Commission renumbers this section and adds metric parentheticals to the inch/pound statements and examples.</textblock>
    <textblock>Further, subsections 500.16(b)(1) and (b)(2) are brought into conformity with other sections of the amendments by specifying the customary inch/pound units of liquid and dry measurement which should be used.</textblock>
    <textblock>M. Section 500.17␣Fractions</textblock>
    <textblock>Formerly §500.16, the Commission renumbers this section and adds the requirement that SI metric declarations contain only decimal fractions. This prohibition against using common fractions with metric units is consistent with staff interpretations dating from 1984 and with proper metric usage. In accordance with the amendments to FPLA, the amendment to this section states that decimal fractions shall not be carried out to more than three decimal places, rather than the previous two decimal places.</textblock>
    <textblock>N. Section 500.18␣SI Metric Prefixes</textblock>
    <textblock>This is a new section and presents the metric prefixes to be used on labels. Unlike scientific metric prefix charts which have prefixes for huge amounts, e.g. ``exa-'' for units with eighteen trailing digits (1,000,000,000,000,000,000) and for minuscule amounts, e.g. ``atto-'' for units with eighteen preceding digits (.000 000 000 000 000 000 1), the chart is restricted to prefixes usable in the size range of consumer commodities. The chart contained in the proposed regulation referred to ``kilo-'', ``hecto-'', ``deca-'', ``deci-'', ``centi-'', and ``milli-''. However, based on comments received, the Commission is adding the prefix ``micro-'' and its appropriate symbol, the Greek letter ``mu'' (μ) and deleting the ``hecto-.'' As stated by one commenter, the micrometer ``*␣*␣* is used for thickness of plastic and other material thicknesses *␣*␣*.''</textblock>
    <textblock>33</textblock>
    <textblock>Since the Commission's FPLA regulations govern products such as garbage bags, foil and other household wrapping products the Commission has determined that it is appropriate to add the prefix for the SI metric unit used to describe their thickness. The comments stated that the prefix ``hecto'' was not used on consumer products.</textblock>
    <textblock>34</textblock>
    <textblock>O. Section 500.19␣Conversion of SI Metric Quantities to Inch/Pound and Inch/Pound Quantities to SI metric Quantities</textblock>
    <textblock>This is a new section. Subsection (a) sets out the</textblock>
    <textblock>conversion factors for converting from metric to inch/pound and from inch/pound to metric quantities. The chart facilitates compliance with the 1992 amendments to the FPLA requiring dual inch/pound and metric disclosure by giving manufacturers the technical information they need to convert one measurement system to the other. The factors used in this chart are consistent with those published in the ``Guide for the Use of the International System of Units,'' NIST Special Publication 811, Department of Commerce, September, 1991, and ``Preferred Metric Units For General Use by the Federal Government,'' Federal Standard 376B, General Services Administration, January 27, 1993. Because many of the products governed by the Commission's regulations issued under the FPLA are measured in the customary inch/pound unit ``mil'' (1/1000 of an inch), the Commission has added a factor for converting mils into the SI metric unit micrometer.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subsection (b), relating to the number of digits to be used in making the required content disclosures, was not in the proposed regulation but has been added as the result of the comments received. As discussed in section III.D. above, the issue of the degree of precision needed in making the disclosures generated 12 comments</textblock>
    <textblock>35</textblock>
    <textblock>, 11 of which argued for avoiding unneeded degrees of accuracy. Based on the logic contained in the comments, the Commission has determined that for most declarations of content the use of three significant digits will suffice to give consumers adequate information. In certain situations, i.e., where the quantity involved is below 100 grams, milliliters, centimeters, square centimeters or cubic centimeters, the manufacturer or distributor has the option of using two digits. The prescribed use of three and two digits is consistent with the Uniform Packaging and Labeling Act adopted by the National Conference on Weights and Measures and the packaging and labeling regulations of the Canadian Legal Metrology Branch.</textblock>
    <textblock>36</textblock>
    <textblock>P. Section 500.20␣Conspicuousness</textblock>
    <textblock>Formerly §500.17, the Commission renumbers this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>Q. Section 500.21␣Type Size in Relationship to the Area of the Principal Display Panel</textblock>
    <textblock>Formerly §500.18, the Commission renumbers this section and amends it to add metric parentheticals. Subsection (g) is new and relates to the size requirements of the ```e' mark.''</textblock>
