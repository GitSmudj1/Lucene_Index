    <textblock>Dotson argues that, due to the severity of his drug addiction, he needs the cocaine and heroin in order for him to steal and panhandle. (Of course, he steals and panhandles so that he can purchase more cocaine and heroin, so that he can continue to steal and panhandle_and thus the cycle of addiction continues.) Because he needs the narcotics in order to engage in SGA, Dotson continues, he believes that the cost of the cocaine and heroin should be deducted from his earnings as an IRWE.</textblock>
    <textblock>Sadly, we have no reason to disbelieve Dotson's self-characterization. Unfortunately for him, however, the regulations comprehend more than mere addiction to a substance before the cost of that substance will be considered an IRWE. As the statute and regulations reveal, a number of obstacles lie in the path of Dotson's argument. We content ourselves, however, to focus upon the requirement that in order to be an IRWE a drug must ``reduce or eliminate'' the symptoms of a claimant's impairment, or ``slow down its progression.'' 20 CFR 416.976(c)(5)(i). In the face of Dotson's claim that his disability stems from drug abuse, he cannot hope to maintain the argument that his continued use of heroin and cocaine reduces or eliminates the symptoms of his impairment. Rather, Dotson's use of drugs serves as the basis of his alleged disability. And far from slowing Dotson's dependency upon narcotics, his continued use of heroin and cocaine only exacerbates his disability. With these considerations in mind, we must reject Dotson's claim for an IRWE.</textblock>
    <textblock>E. The Constitutional Claims</textblock>
    <textblock>Dotson lastly argues that using illegal activity to constitute SGA violates his rights to due process and equal protection of the laws under the United States Constitution, although he has encountered some difficulty in articulating the precise nature of his constitutional complaints. It would seem that his due process argument_one which might be more properly construed as an administrative challenge to the regulations_reduces to the theory that the ALJ's decision in this case attempts to override Congress' intent to provide SSI benefits to substance abusers and, therefore, is void for want of a rational basis. His equal protection claim, on the other hand, appears based on the assertion that, under the Secretary's position, rich drug addicts will be treated preferentially to the disadvantage of poor ones. We briefly address each of his arguments.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Due Process</textblock>
    <textblock>To establish a due process violation, Dotson faces the well-settled and formidable burden of proving that the Secretary's regulations, as we have interpreted them, lack a rational basis. See,</textblock>
    <textblock>e.g., Weinberger</textblock>
    <textblock>v.</textblock>
    <textblock>Salfi,</textblock>
    <textblock>422 U.S. 749, 768 (1975) (``the Due Process Clause can be thought to interpose a bar only if the statute [or, as here, a regulation] manifests a patently arbitrary classification, utterly lacking in rational justification [citation omitted]''). Moreover, that rational basis need not be expressed explicitly by Congress or the administrative agency; ``any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.''</textblock>
    <textblock>Dandridge</textblock>
    <textblock>v.</textblock>
    <textblock>Williams,</textblock>
    <textblock>397 U.S. 471, 485 (1970) (citation omitted).</textblock>
    <textblock>Initially, we note that interpreting the Secretary's regulations as allowing illegal activity to constitute SGA does not interfere with Congress' intent, assuming there is one, to provide disability benefits to substance abusers.</textblock>
    <textblock>12</textblock>
    <textblock>Rather, such an interpretation prevents only those substance abusers who are engaging in SGA, whether legally or illegally employed, from receiving SSI benefits reserved for disabled persons who are also poor. See</textblock>
    <textblock>Bowen</textblock>
    <textblock>v.</textblock>
    <textblock>Yuckert,</textblock>
    <textblock>482 U.S. 137, 140 (1987) (``Title XVI of the Act provides for the payment of disability benefits to indigent persons *␣*␣*.'' [Emphasis added.]) Thus, the Secretary's regulations coincide with the SSI program's underlying purpose.</textblock>
    <textblock>Moving to the next level, Dotson's myopic view of Congress' intent in the statutory context serves to highlight the flaw in his constitutional argument. Simply put, we cannot say that regulations which preclude the disbursement of federal disability benefits to persons who are engaging in substantial and gainful activity, regardless of the activity's legality, constitutes a ``patently arbitrary classification'' warranting judicial intervention. To the contrary, working within a system where the limited supply of federal funds will never satisfy the deserving demand, we are hard pressed to think of a better dividing line than the one drawn by the Secretary. Having said this much, we must reject Dotson's due process claim.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Equal Protection</textblock>
    <textblock>Dotson faces an equally difficult burden when arguing to this court that the Secretary's regulations violate the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment. Because a statute's or regulation's differential impact upon the poor versus the wealthy, by itself, does not subject that distinction to strict judicial scrutiny, see,</textblock>
    <textblock>e.g., Kadrmas</textblock>
    <textblock>v.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dickinson Public Schools,</textblock>
    <textblock>487 U.S. 450, 458 (1988), Dotson must prove that the classification drawn by the Secretary's regulations fails to rationally further a legitimate interest,</textblock>
    <textblock>Zobel</textblock>
    <textblock>v.</textblock>
    <textblock>Williams,</textblock>
    <textblock>457 U.S. 55, 60 (1982). Under such a standard, Dotson's constitutional claim again must fail.</textblock>
  </text>
  <footnote>
    <textblock>We are inclined to agree with Dotson that Congress has envisioned the application of the Act to substance abusers. See,</textblock>
    <textblock>e.g.,</textblock>
    <textblock>42 U.S.C. 1382(e)(3)(A) (requiring SSI recipients who are alcoholics or drug addicts to undergo treatment as a condition of receiving disability benefits); 42 U.S.C. 1383(a)(2)(A)(ii) (providing for payment of SSI benefits to alcoholics and drug addicts through representative payees).</textblock>
