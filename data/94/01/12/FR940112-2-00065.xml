    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>In settlement of alleged violations of federal law prohibiting unfair acts and practices and unfair methods of competition, this consent order allows, among other things, the respondents to proceed with the proposed acquisition of certain DuPont assets, but it requires the respondents to divest, within 15 months, a predetermined acrylic-plastic manufacturing capacity by selling one of their U.S. plants to a Commission-approved purchaser, and to provide the buyer with technical assistance for 18 months, if necessary. In addition, if the divestiture is not accomplished in the specified time-frame, the respondents agree to a Commission-appointed trustee to complete the transaction.</textblock>
