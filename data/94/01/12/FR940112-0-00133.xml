    <textblock>(a) If less than 1 square foot (929 cm2), in terms of square inches and fractions thereof.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) If at least 1 square foot (929 cm2) but less than 4 square feet (37.1 dm2), in terms of square feet with any remainder in terms of square inches or common or decimal fractions of the square foot.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) If 4 square feet (37.1 dm2) or more, in terms of the largest appropriate whole unit (square yards, square yards and square feet, or square feet) with any remainder in terms of square inches or common or decimal fractions of the square foot or square yard.</textblock>

    <textblock>Statements of cubic measure and dry measure.</textblock>
    <textblock>Statements of cubic measure and dry measure shall be expressed in terms most appropriate to the providing of accurate information as to the net quantity of contents, and to the facilitating of value comparisons by consumers. When the content declaration on a commodity sold in compressed form is stated in terms of cubic measure there may also be a statement indicating the amount of material from which the final product was compressed. Such statement shall not exceed the actual amount of material that can be recovered.</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง500.15</textblock>
    <textblock>Units of count, more than one ply.</textblock>
    <textblock>If the commodity is in distinct usable units made up of one or more components or ply, the statement of net quantity of contents shall (in addition to complying with the requirements of linear and area measurement declaration for each unit as specified in ยง500.12) include the number of ply and the total number of usable units.</textblock>
    <textblock>(</textblock>
    <textblock>Example:</textblock>
    <textblock>``100 2-ply facial tissues, 81/2 inches x 10 inches'' (21.5 x 25.4 cm).) For the purposes of this section, roll type commodities (e.g. paper towels), irrespective of perforations, shall not be considered to be usable units, and shall be labeled in terms of total area measurement and the number of ply. Such area measurement, however, shall be supplemented by a count statement and the dimensions of a single unit.</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง500.16</textblock>
    <textblock>Measurement of container type commodities, how expressed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notwithstanding other provisions of this Part 500 of the regulations pertaining to the expression of net quantity of contents by measurement, commodities designed and sold at retail to be used as containers for other materials or objects, such as bags, cups, boxes, and pans, shall be labeled in accordance with the following paragraphs:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) The declaration of net quantity for container commodities shall be expressed as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) For bag type commodities, in terms of count followed by linear dimensions of the bag (whether packaged in a perforated roll or otherwise) Net quantity of contents in terms of feet and inches shall be expressed as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) When the unit bag is characterized by two dimensions because of the absence of a gusset, the width and length will be expressed in inches, except that a dimension of 2 feet or more will be expressed in feet with any remainder in terms of inches or common or decimal fractions of the foot.</textblock>
    <textblock>(</textblock>
    <textblock>Example:</textblock>
    <textblock>``25 bags, 17 in. x 20 in. (43.1 x 50.8 cm)'' or ``200 bags, 20 in. x 2 ft. 6 in. (50.8 x 76.2 cm)'', or ``50 bags, 20 in. x 21/2 ft. (50.8 x 76.2 cm)''.)</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) When the unit bag is gussetted, the dimensions will be expressed as width, depth and length in terms of inches except that any dimensions of 2 feet or more will be expressed in feet with any remainder in terms of inches or the common or decimal fractions of the foot.</textblock>
    <textblock>(</textblock>
    <textblock>Examples:</textblock>
    <textblock>``25 bags, 17 in. x 4 in. x 20 in. (43 x 10 x 50 cm)'', or ``200 bags, 20 in. x 12 in. x 21/2 ft. (50.8 x 30.4 x 76.2 cm)''.)</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) For other square, oblong, rectangular or similarly shaped containers, in terms of count followed by length, width, and depth except depth need not be listed when less than 2 inches (5.08 cm).</textblock>
    <textblock>(</textblock>
    <textblock>Example:</textblock>
    <textblock>``2 cake pans, 8 in. x 8 in. (20.3 x 20.3 cm)'', or ``roasting pan, 12 in. x 8 in. x 3 in. (30.4 x 20.3 x 7.62 cm)''.)</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) For circular or other generally round shaped containers, except cups, and the like, in terms of count followed by diameter and depth except depth need not be listed when less than 2 inches (5.08 cm).</textblock>
    <textblock>(</textblock>
    <textblock>Example:</textblock>
    <textblock>``4 pie pans, 8 in. diameter (20.3 cm)'' or ``2 cake pans, 8 in. diameter x 4 in. (20.3 x 10.1 cm)''.)</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) When the functional use of the container is related by label reference in standard terms of measure to the capability of holding a specific quantity of substance or class of substances such references shall be a part of the net quantity statement and shall specify capacity as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Liquid measure for containers which are intended to be used for liquids, semi-solids, viscous materials or mixtures of solids and liquids. The customary inch/pound statement of capacity shall be stated in terms of the largest whole U.S. gallon of 231 cubic inches, quart, pint, or ounce with any remainder in terms of the common or decimal fraction of that unit.</textblock>
    <textblock>(</textblock>
    <textblock>Example:</textblock>
    <textblock>Freezer Boxes: ``4 boxes, 1 qt. capacity, 6 in. x 6 in. x 4 in. (946 mL capacity, 15.2 x 15.2 x 10.1 cm)''.)</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Dry measure for containers which are intended to be used for solids. The customary inch/pound statement of capacity shall be stated in terms of the largest whole U.S. bushel of 2,150.42 cubic inches, peck, dry quart, or dry pint with any remainder in terms of the common or decimal fraction of that unit.</textblock>
    <textblock>(</textblock>
    <textblock>Example:</textblock>
    <textblock>Leaf Bags: ``8 bags, 6 bushel capacity, 4 feet x 5 feet (211 L capacity_1.21 m x 1.52 m)''.)</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Where containers are used as liners for other more permanent containers, in the same terms as are normally used to express the capacity of the more permanent container.</textblock>
    <textblock>(</textblock>
    <textblock>Example:</textblock>
    <textblock>Garbage Can Liners: ``10 liners, 2 ft. 6 in. x 3 ft. 1 in., fits up to 30 gallon cans (76.2 x 93.9 cm, fits up to 113 L cans''.)</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Notwithstanding the above requirements, the net quantity statement for containers such as cups will be listed in terms of count and liquid capacity per unit.</textblock>
    <textblock>(</textblock>
    <textblock>Example:</textblock>
    <textblock>``24 cups, 6 fl. oz. capacity (177 mL)''.)</textblock>
