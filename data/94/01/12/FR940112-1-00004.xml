    <textblock>The FAA estimates that 2,265 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 16 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed initial inspection and replacement, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $1,100 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $4,484,700. This cost figure is based on the assumption that none of the affected airplane owners/operators have accomplished the proposed actions. The FAA believes that some airplane owners/operators have already incorporated the inspection terminating MLG trunnion replacements. With this in mind, the FAA anticipates that the cost of the proposed AD would be much lower than the figure referenced above.</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption</textblock>

    <textblock>The Proposed Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.</textblock>
    <textblock>§39.13</textblock>
    <textblock>[Amended]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new AD:</textblock>
    <textblock>Piper Aircraft Corporation:</textblock>
    <textblock>Docket 93-CE-58-AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability:</textblock>
    <textblock>The following model and serial number airplanes that are not equipped with main landing gear (MLG) trunnions (both left and right side) that have either part number (P/N) 67926-30, 67926-31, 67926-32, 67926-33, 39486-14, or 39486-15, as applicable, certificated in any category:</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance:</textblock>
    <textblock>Required as indicated, unless already accomplished.</textblock>
    <textblock>To prevent collapse of the main landing gear caused by cracked trunnions, which could result in airplane damage, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>Note</textblock>
    <textblock>1: The paragraph structure of this AD is as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Level 1: (a), (b), (c), etc.</textblock>
    <textblock>Level 2: (1), (2), (3), etc.</textblock>
    <textblock>Level 3: (i), (ii), (iii), etc.</textblock>
    <textblock>Level 2 and Level 3 structures are designations of the Level 1 paragraph they immediately follow.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Upon the accumulation of 500 hours time-in-service (TIS) on a MLG trunnion, dye-penetrant inspect the MLG trunnion for cracks in accordance with the INSTRUCTIONS section of Piper Service Bulletin (SB) 787B, dated August 25, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note</textblock>
    <textblock>2: If hours TIS on the MLG trunnion are unknown, hours TIS accumulated on the airplane may be substituted.</textblock>
