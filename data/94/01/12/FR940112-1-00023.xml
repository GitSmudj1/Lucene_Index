    <textblock>I. Introduction</textblock>
    <textblock>On July 23, 1993, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NOPR)</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>in which the Commission proposed to amend 18 CFR Parts 141 and 385 to provide for the electronic filing of FERC Form No. 1, ``Annual Report of Major electric utilities, licensees and others'' (Form 1). Under the proposed rule, in addition to paper copies, future Form 1 filings would also be made by means of a computer diskette incorporating software programming developed by the Commission. Electronic reporting of Form 1 was proposed to commence with reporting year 1993, due on or before April 30, 1994. No change was proposed in Form 1 itself.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission also proposed to amend 18 CFR part 375 to delegate to the Chief Accountant or his designee the authority to act on requests for waiver of the Form 1 and Form 1-F</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>filing requirements.</textblock>

    <textblock>three industry associations</textblock>
    <textblock>5</textblock>
    <textblock>and the Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy.</textblock>
