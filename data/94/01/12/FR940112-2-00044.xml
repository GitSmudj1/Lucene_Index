    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>In September 1991, the State of California passed legislation that effectively required the eight separate counties of the San Joaquin Valley Air Basin to form a single air pollution control district (APCD). EPA had delegated PSD authority to Fresno County APCD by an agreement dated December 23, 1985. Because the San Joaquin Valley Unified APCD has chosen to defer to EPA the regulation of sources subject to PSD rules at 40 CFR 52.21, EPA is responding to their request to rescind PSD authority previously delegated to Fresno County APCD.</textblock>
    <textblock>The following letter represents the terms and conditions of the rescission.</textblock>
    <textblock>The PSD Delegation of Authority is reviewable under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act only in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. A petition for review must be filed by March 14, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dated: December 10, 1993.</textblock>
