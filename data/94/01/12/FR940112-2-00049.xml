    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA issued a notice, which was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of May 6, 1992 (57 FR 19428), announcing the establishment of temporary tolerance for residues of the fungicide fosetyl-Al, aluminum tris (</textblock>
    <textblock>O</textblock>
    <textblock>-ethylphosphonate) in or on the raw agricultural commodity cotton at 0.20 parts per million (ppm). This tolerance was issued in response to pesticide petition (PP) 1G3997, submitted by Rhone-Poulenc AG Company, P.O. Box 12014, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.</textblock>
    <textblock>This temporary tolerance has been extended to permit the continued marketing of the raw agricultural commodity named above when treated in accordance with the provisions of experimental use permit 264-EUP-91, which is being issued under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) as amended (Pub. L. 95-396, 92 Stat. 819; 7 U.S.C. 136).</textblock>
    <textblock>The scientific data reported and other relevant material were evaluated, and it was determined that the extension of this temporary tolerance will protect the public health. Therefore, the temporary tolerance has been extended on the condition that the pesticide be used in accordance with the experimental use permit and with the following provisions:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The total amount of the active fungicide to be used must not exceed the quantity authorized by the experimental use permit.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Rhone-Poulenc AG Company must immediately notify the EPA of any findings from the experimental use that have a bearing on safety. The company must also keep records of production, distribution, and performance and on request make the records available to any authorized officer or employee of the EPA or the Food and Drug Administration.</textblock>
    <textblock>This tolerance expires January 1, 1996. Residues not in excess of this amount remaining in or on the raw agricultural commodity after this expiration date will not be considered actionable if the pesticide is legally applied during the term of, and in accordance with, the provisions of the experimental use permit and temporary tolerance. This tolerance may be revoked if the experimental use permit is revoked or if any experience with or scientific data on this pesticide indicate that such revocation is necessary to protect the public health.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this notice from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).</textblock>
