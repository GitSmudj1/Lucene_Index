    <textblock>The examples of disclosures set out in this section and others are intended to assist manufacturers and distributors in designing labels which comply with the amendments to the regulations. The examples are not mandatory and set out different options. For instance, in the only reference to fractions of measurement units, the amendments to the FPLA state that decimal fractions of pounds and metric mass units may be ``carried out to not more than three decimal places.'' (15 U.S.C. 1453) This is a change from the original FPLA, which restricted decimal fractions to two places. The examples in the Commission's amended regulations use different decimal places to show that the manufacturer or distributor can choose which to use. As another instance of options presented to manufacturers or distributors, some of the examples used in the amended regulations state the SI metric measurement first while others put customary inch/pound units first.</textblock>
    <textblock>The high degree of precision used in the examples contained in the proposed amendments generated thirteen comments.</textblock>
    <textblock>20</textblock>
    <textblock>But for one,</textblock>
    <textblock>21</textblock>
    <textblock>the comments uniformly stated that the examples use too precise measurements for commercial purposes. The comments suggest that in most instances three digits, including both whole number and decimals, should be used while in certain situations two digits should be allowed. As a result of the comments, the Commission has changed the examples throughout the regulations to use three and two digits as suggested and has added an amendment to §500.19 (see part III.O. below) embodying such usage.</textblock>
    <textblock>22</textblock>
    <textblock>The only description of measurement precision in the 1992 amendments to the FPLA is in section 4(a)(3)(A), which states that for certain packages decimal fractions may be carried out to no more than three places. Based upon this statutory language, the illustrative examples used in the proposed amendments contained up to three decimal places. Sometimes this resulted in examples using as many as six total digits, including whole numbers and decimal places. The comments generally stated that such precision implies a greater measuring accuracy than is likely to be possible.</textblock>
    <textblock>23</textblock>
    <textblock>The comment from Mr. John Buchanan is illustrative:</textblock>
    <textblock>I suggest that the regulatory requirement for net quantity be limited to three significant digits, which would still be consistent with the FPLA specification but would lead to less cluttered labels, greater truth in labeling by removing the spurious accuracy, and a more rapid conception of the metric system by consumers. *␣*␣* Conversions such as 1 lb. (453.59 g) look very intimidating to the average citizen. Some of the implied accuracies are bordering on the ludicrous, for example, in 500.27 you are suggesting that the linear dimensions of facial tissue can be measured to one-hundredth of a millimetre, which is less than the diameter of a single fiber! Or, in 500.16, where the capacity of a 6 fl. oz. cup is expressed to an accuracy of one-hundredth of a millilitre_far less than one drop.</textblock>
    <textblock>24</textblock>
    <textblock>Based upon its consideration of the comments, the Commission has changed the examples used in the final amendments. The changes require the use of three digits for the quantity declaration (e.g., ``453g (1 lb)'' (§500.9(a)) except where the quantity is below 100 grams, milliliters, centimeters, square centimeters or cubic centimeters where the quantity declaration can be shown in two figures (e.g. ``17 in.×4 in.×20 in. (43×10×50 cm)'' (500.16(a)(1)(ii)). These changes bring the amended regulations into conformity with the Uniform Packaging and Labeling Regulation adopted by the National Conference on Weights and Measures and the packaging and labeling regulations of the Canadian Legal Metrology Branch.</textblock>
    <textblock>25</textblock>
    <textblock>Aside from the above changes, subsection (a) requires the use of grams, milligrams, and kilograms as well as pounds and ounces in weight or mass declarations. Examples of dual declarations are included.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subsection (b) requires the use of liters and milliliters as well as gallons, quarts, and pints in fluid measure disclosure. The term ``Celsius'' replaces ``Centigrade'' because Centigrade is obsolete for temperature measurement.</textblock>
