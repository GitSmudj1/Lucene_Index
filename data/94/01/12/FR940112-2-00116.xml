    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The objective of this effort is to organize and conduct a peer review of the CONTAIN code, light water reactor version. The peer review is to provide an independent assessment of the modeling capabilities and limitations, and adequacy of the CONTAIN code. The results of the peer review are to be documented in a summary report that describes the results of the independent assessment by the peer review participants and the technical acceptability of the code.</textblock>
    <textblock>A peer review committee has been organized using recognized experts from the national laboratories, universities, CONTAIN user community and independent contractors. Meetings are held to discuss and evaluate the applicability and state of validation of the various CONTAIN phenomenological models. The meeting scheduled for January 19-21, 1994, is the third meeting of the CONTAIN Peer Review Committee. The Committee will (1) present preliminary review findings, (2) review code sensitivity studies, and (3) receive briefings from the code development staff about the integrated code and the detailed models in the code.</textblock>
