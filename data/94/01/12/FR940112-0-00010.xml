    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>History</textblock>
    <textblock>On August 17, 1993, the FAA proposed to amend part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to amend the Class D airspace for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Boeing Field Airport, and Renton Municipal Airport, Washington (58 FR 43573).</textblock>
    <textblock>Interested parties were invited to participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written comments on the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal were received. This amendment is the same as that proposed in the notice, except some coordinates of the airspace descriptions have been changed slightly to delete a small amount of Class D airspace south of Boeing Field which was found to be unnecessary. The coordinates in the proposal were North American Datum 27; however, these coordinates have been updated to North American Datum 83. Class D airspace areas are published in paragraph 5000 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class D airspace designation listed in this document will be published subsequently in the Order.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Rule</textblock>
    <textblock>This amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations amends the Class D airspace for Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, Boeing Field Airport, and Renton Municipal Airport, Washington. These changes are necessary to reflect the actual airspace delegated to each airport traffic control tower and to show this airspace on appropriate aeronautical charts for pilots' use.</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore: (1) Is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</textblock>
