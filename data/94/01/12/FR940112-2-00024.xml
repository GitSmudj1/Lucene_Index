    <textblock>Second Revised Sheet No. 140</textblock>
    <textblock>According to Alabama-Tennessee, this filing is being made to comply with the order issued by the Commission on November 26, 1993 in Alabama-Tennessee Natural Gas Co., 65 FERC ¶61, 262 (1993). Alabama-Tennessee states that the first of these revised tariff sheets reflects certain minor changes to its proposed treatment of the Account No. 191 credit balance amounts contained in its original filing in this docket which it submitted on October 29, 1993. Second Revised Sheet No. 140 provides additional clarifying language that Alabama-Tennessee will flowthrough any purchased gas adjustment refunds regardless of when it receives such refunds. In addition, in connection with its filing, Alabama-Tennessee has submitted various working papers in connection with its proposed treatment of the Account No. 191 credit balance.</textblock>

    <textblock>Alabama-Tennessee states that copies of its filing were served upon the Company's customers and affected state commissions as well as all the parties shown on the Commission's official service list established in this proceeding.</textblock>
