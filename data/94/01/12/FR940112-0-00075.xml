    <textblock>Final rule with comment period.</textblock>

  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule with comment period permits States flexibility to revise the process by which incurred medical expenses are considered to reduce an individual's or family's income to become Medicaid eligible. This process is commonly referred to as ``spenddown.'' Only States which cover the medically needy, and States which use more restrictive criteria to determine eligibility of the aged, blind, and disabled, than the criteria used to determine eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits (section 1902(f) States) have a spenddown.</textblock>
    <textblock>These revisions permit States to: Consider as incurred medical expenses projected institutional expenses at the Medicaid reimbursement rate, and deduct those projected expenses from income in determining eligibility; combine the retroactive and prospective medically needy budget periods; either include or exclude medical expenses incurred earlier than the third month before the month of application (States must, however, deduct current payments on old bills not previously deducted in any budget period); and deduct incurred medical expenses from income in the order in which the services were provided, in the order each bill is submitted to the agency, or by type of service.</textblock>
    <textblock>All States with medically needy programs using the criteria of the SSI program may implement any of the provisions. States using more restrictive criteria than the SSI program under section 1902(f) of the Social Security Act may implement all of these provisions except for the option to exclude medical expenses incurred earlier than the third month before the month of application.</textblock>
