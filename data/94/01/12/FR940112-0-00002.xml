    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule amends agency regulations by adding the names of airlines who have entered into agreements with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (Service) under the purview of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the Act). This rule is necessary so that air carriers who become signatory to preinspection or transit without visa (TWOV) agreements with the Services are listed in agency regulations. This rule also adds Aruba and Paradise Island, Bahamas to the list of preinspection stations.</textblock>

    <textblock>EFFECTIVE DATE:</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule is effective January 12, 1994.</textblock>

    <textblock>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</textblock>
    <textblock>Una Brien, Assistant Chief Inspector, Inspections Division, Immigration and Naturalization Service, 425 I Street, NW., room 7228, Washington, DC 20536, telephone (202) 514-2681.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the current regulations, air carriers are required to enter into contracts with the Service in order to participate in the preinspection and Transit Without Visa (TWOV) programs. Contracts have been signed using Forms I-425 (Agreement for Preinspection) and I-426 (Immediate and Continuous Transit Agreement) under the purview of section 238 of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Accordingly, §§238.3 and 238.4 of title 8 of the Code of Federal Regulations are being amended to include these carriers.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Service's implementation of this rule as a final rule is based upon the ``good cause'' exception found at 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(B) and (d)(3). The reasons for immediate implementation of this final rule are as follows: A notice and comment period for a proposed rule is unnecessary because this regulation merely updates the listing of carriers and preinspection stations signatory with the agency. Moreover, it imposes a benefit rather than a burden or penalty of any kind to applicable persons.</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization Service certifies that this rule does not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. It is anticipated that this rule will not have a significant adverse economic impact since this rule merely amends agency regulations by adding to the list of airline carriers and preinspection stations. This rule is not significant within the meaning of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866, nor does this rule have Federalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment in accordance with Executive Order 12612.</textblock>
