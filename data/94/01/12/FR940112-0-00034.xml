    <textblock>7. Section 404.511 is amended by revising the section</textblock>
    <textblock>heading and by revising paragraph (b) to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§404.511</textblock>
    <textblock>When an individual is at ``fault'' in a deduction</textblock>
    <textblock>overpayment.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Subsequent deduction overpayments.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Social Security Administration generally will not find an</textblock>
    <textblock>individual to be without fault where, after having been</textblock>
    <textblock>exonerated for a ``deduction overpayment'' and after having been</textblock>
    <textblock>advised of the correct interpretation of the deduction provision,</textblock>
    <textblock>the individual incurs another ``deduction overpayment'' under the</textblock>
    <textblock>same circumstances as the first overpayment. However, in</textblock>
    <textblock>determining whether the individual is without fault, the Social</textblock>
    <textblock>Security Administration will consider all of the pertinent</textblock>
    <textblock>circumstances surrounding the prior and subsequent ``deduction</textblock>
    <textblock>overpayments,'' including any physical, mental, educational, or</textblock>
    <textblock>linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the</textblock>
    <textblock>English language) which the individual may have.</textblock>
