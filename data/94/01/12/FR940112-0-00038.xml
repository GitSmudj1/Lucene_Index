    <textblock>(2) We will not find you ineligible for SSI benefits if you</textblock>
    <textblock>have a good reason for not applying for the other benefits within</textblock>
    <textblock>the 30-day period or taking other necessary steps to obtain them.</textblock>
    <textblock>In determining whether a good reason exists, we will take into</textblock>
    <textblock>account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic</textblock>
    <textblock>limitations (including any lack of facility with the English</textblock>
    <textblock>language) which may have caused you to fail to apply for other</textblock>
    <textblock>benefits. You may have a good reason if, for example_</textblock>

    <textblock>3. The authority citation for subpart E is revised to read</textblock>
    <textblock>as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>Secs. 1102, 1601, 1602, 1611(c), and 1631(a)-(d) and (g) of the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 1302, 1381, 1381a, 1382(c), and 1383(a)-(d) and (g).</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Section 416.552 is amended by adding after the fifth</textblock>
    <textblock>sentence of the introductory text a new sentence to read as</textblock>
    <textblock>follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§416.552</textblock>
    <textblock>Waiver of adjustment or recovery_without fault.</textblock>
    <textblock>*␣*␣* In determining whether an individual is without fault</textblock>
    <textblock>based on a consideration of these factors, the Social Security</textblock>
    <textblock>Administration will take into account any physical, mental,</textblock>
    <textblock>educational, or linguistic limitations (including any lack of</textblock>
    <textblock>facility with the English language) the individual may have. *␣*␣*</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Section 416.556 is amended by revising paragraph (b) to</textblock>
    <textblock>read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§416.556</textblock>
    <textblock>Waiver of adjustment or recovery_countable resources</textblock>
    <textblock>in excess of the limits prescribed in §416.1205 by $50 or less.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Failure to report the excess resources correctly and in a</textblock>
    <textblock>timely manner will be considered to be willful and knowing and</textblock>
    <textblock>the individual will be found to be at fault when the evidence</textblock>
    <textblock>clearly shows the individual (and spouse if any) was fully aware</textblock>
    <textblock>of the requirements of the law and of the excess resources and</textblock>
    <textblock>chose to conceal these resources. When an individual incurred a</textblock>
    <textblock>similar overpayment in the past and received an explanation and</textblock>
    <textblock>instructions at the time of the previous overpayment, we will</textblock>
    <textblock>generally find the individual to be at fault. However, in</textblock>
    <textblock>determining whether the individual is at fault, we will consider</textblock>
    <textblock>all aspects of the current and prior overpayment situations, and</textblock>
    <textblock>where we determine the individual is not at fault, we will waive</textblock>
    <textblock>adjustment or recovery of the subsequent overpayment. In making</textblock>
    <textblock>any determination or decision under this section concerning</textblock>
    <textblock>whether an individual is at fault, including a determination or</textblock>
    <textblock>decision of whether the failure to report the excess resources</textblock>
    <textblock>correctly and in a timely manner was willful and knowing, we will</textblock>
    <textblock>take into account any physical, mental, educational, or</textblock>
    <textblock>linguistic limitations (including any lack of facility with the</textblock>
    <textblock>English language) of the individual (and spouse if any).</textblock>
    <textblock>6. The authority citation for subpart G of part 416</textblock>
    <textblock>continues to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>Secs. 1102, 1611, 1612, 1613, 1614, and 1631 of</textblock>
    <textblock>the Social Security Act; 42 U.S.C. 1302, 1382, 1382a, 1382b,</textblock>
    <textblock>1382c, and 1383; sec. 211 of Pub. L. 93-66, 87 Stat. 154.</textblock>
    <textblock>7. Section 416.732 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§416.732</textblock>
    <textblock>No penalty deduction if you have good cause for failure</textblock>
    <textblock>to report timely.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) We will find that you have good cause for failure to</textblock>
    <textblock>report timely and we will not impose a penalty deduction, if_</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) You are ``without fault'' as defined in §416.552; or</textblock>
