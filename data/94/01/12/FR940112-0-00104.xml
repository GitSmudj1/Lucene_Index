    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>RSPA is granting an extension for the continued construction of cargo tank motor vehicles to the MC 306, MC 307, MC 312, MC 331, and MC 338 specifications. The date is extended from April 21, 1994 to August 31, 1995. This extension is based on comments received from the Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association, the Heil Co., and members of the Compressed Gas Association. This final rule allows cargo tank manufacturers additional time to implement engineering</textblock>
    <textblock>procedures required for manufacture of cargo tank motor</textblock>
    <textblock>vehicles to the new DOT 406, DOT 407 and DOT 412 specifications and to implement design modifications as a result of changes to the structural integrity calculations in the MC 331 and MC 338 specifications.</textblock>
