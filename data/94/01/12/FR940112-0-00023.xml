    <textblock>I. Introduction</textblock>
    <textblock>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (Commission) is revising its regulations in part 385 governing Commission review of contested Department of Energy (DOE) remedial orders. The Commission is removing the requirement that the presiding officer submit a revised proposed order to the Commission at the same time as he or she certifies and files with the Secretary the record in the proceeding and copies of written comments by the parties.</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Background and Discussion</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission reviews contested DOE remedial orders pursuant to section 503(c) of the Department of Energy Organization Act (DOE Act).</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the current Rules of Practice and Procedure, the Commission Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) who presides over a remedial order proceeding issues a public decision and proposed order following the hearing in the matter. The parties then have an opportunity to file comments and reply comments. The ALJ receives the comments and certifies the record to the Commission. In addition, the Judge also submits to the Commission a nonpublic ``revised proposed order.'' The revised proposed order is not part of the record of the proceeding.</textblock>
