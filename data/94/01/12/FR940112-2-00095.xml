    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3600-3619), the Department is authorized to investigate complaints alleging discrimination in housing. (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968 as amended by the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 is cited as the ``Fair Housing Act.'') Section 810(f) of the Fair Housing Act requires the Department to refer complaints to State and local agencies that have ``substantially equivalent'' fair housing standards, as determined and certified by the Department. The</textblock>
    <textblock>standards and procedures for certifying State and local fair housing laws that provide substantive rights and remedies for alleged discriminatory housing practices that are substantially equivalent to those provided in the Fair Housing Act are set forth in 24 CFR part 115.</textblock>
    <textblock>On July 23, 1993 (58 FR 39561), the Department published the annual notice required by 24 CFR 115.6, which announced, among other things, the updated, consolidated list of all certified agencies, and a list of agencies with which an agreement for interim referrals or other utilization of services had been entered into under 24 CFR 115.11. In the July 23, 1993 notice, the Department listed thirty-four jurisdictions, of which the State of Arizona was one, which had entered into an agreement with the Department, subsequent to September 12, 1988, for interim referrals, and were considered to have interim certification in accordance with section 810(f)(4) of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 (hereafter ``Act''). (The Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 was enacted on September 13, 1988.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice Announcements and Solicitation of Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with 24 CFR 115.6(c)(1), this notice announces that the fair housing law of the State of Arizona has been determined by the Assistant Secretary of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity to be substantially equivalent, on its face, to the Fair Housing Act. The Assistant Secretary has determined, after</textblock>
    <textblock>application of the criteria set forth in 24 CFR 115.3 and 115.4, that the fair housing law of the State of Arizona provides, on its face, substantive rights and remedies for alleged discriminatory housing practices that are substantially equivalent to those provided in the Fair Housing Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>Following a review of performance standards and other materials pertaining to the fair housing law of the State of Arizona, and its enforcement by the State of Arizona, the Department expects to make a final determination that the law, in operation, provides rights and remedies that are substantially equivalent to those available under the Fair Housing Act. The Department intends to execute a Memorandum of Understanding with the agency charged with enforcement of the fair housing law of the State of Arizona in accordance with ยง115.6(c).</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with 24 CFR 115.6(b), the public is invited to submit written comments on this notice. Specifically, the Department requests written comments on the proposed determination that the current practices and past performance of the agency of the State of Arizona charged with administration and enforcement of the State's fair housing law demonstrate that, in operation, the State law provides substantive rights and remedies that are substantially equivalent to the Fair Housing Act. This notice also</textblock>
    <textblock>invites comments from the public on the Department's determination that the fair housing law of the State of Arizona is substantially equivalent, on its face, to the Fair Housing Act.</textblock>
