    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>This notice is intended to inform the public of the planning effort and to invite public participation in the identification of the planning issues and planning criteria. Public comment will be solicited throughout the planning process. The amended Box Elder RMP will be prepared under 43 CFR, part 1610 to meet the requirements of section 202 of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act. Decisions generated during this planning process will supersede the decisions in the 1986 Box Elder RMP.</textblock>
    <textblock>The RMP amendment and EA will address the general planning issue of management prescriptions for numerous scattered tracts of land (approximately 42,350 acres) which have been acquired and to address management of future land acquisitions. Specific items to be addressed include the possible designation of Areas of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) in the Salt Wells Wildlife Area (WHA), Blue Springs WHA, and the inclusion of additional public lands within the Central Pacific Railroad Grade ACEC and the Donner Creek/Bettridge Creek ACEC. Other topics will include livestock grazing, oil and gas, off-road-vehicle use, wilderness, and land tenure adjustments and any other planning issues that may need to be addressed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Tentative planning criteria to be used are those identified in the existing Box Elder RMP.</textblock>
    <textblock>Public participation is being sought at this initial stage in the planning process to ensure the RMP amendment addresses all issues, problems, and concerns from those interested in the management of lands within the Bear River Resource Area. Necessary amendments to the approved plan will keep the document current and viable.</textblock>
