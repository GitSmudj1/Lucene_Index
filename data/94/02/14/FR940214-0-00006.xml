    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule is effective under Marketing Agreement No. 149 and Order No. 967, both as amended (7 CFR part 967), regulating the handling of celery grown in Florida. The marketing agreement and order are effective under the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), hereinafter referred to as the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department is issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. Under the marketing order provisions now in effect, Florida celery is subject to assessments. It is intended that the assessment rate as issued herein will be applicable to all assessable celery handled during the 1993-94 fiscal year, from August 1, 1993, through July 31, 1994. This rule will not preempt any State or local laws, regulations, or policies unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Act provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provision of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order, is not in accordance with law and requesting a modification of the order or to be exempted therefrom. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After the hearing the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has his or her principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to requirements set forth in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS) has considered the economic impact of this rule on small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of the RFA is to fit regulatory actions to the scale of business subject to such actions in order that small businesses will not be unduly or disproportionately burdened. Marketing orders issued pursuant to the Act, and the rules issued thereunder, are unique in that they are brought about through group action of essentially small entities acting on their own behalf. Thus, both statutes have small entity orientation and compatibility.</textblock>
    <textblock>There are approximately seven producers of Florida celery under this marketing order, and approximately seven handlers. Small agricultural producers have been defined by the Small Business Administration (13 CFR 121.601) as those having annual receipts of less than $500,000, and small agricultural service firms are defined as those whose annual receipts are less than $3,500,000. The majority of Florida celery producers and handlers may be classified as small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>The budget of expenses for the 1993-94 fiscal year was prepared by the Committee, the agency responsible for local administration of the marketing order, and submitted to the Department for approval. The members of the Committee are producers and handlers of Florida celery. They are familiar with the Committee's needs and with the costs of goods and services in their local area and are thus in a position to formulate an appropriate budget. The budget was formulated and discussed in a public meeting. Thus, all directly affected persons have had an opportunity to participate and provide input.</textblock>
    <textblock>The assessment rate recommended by the Committee was derived by dividing anticipated expenses by expected shipments of Florida celery. Because that rate will be applied to actual shipments, it must be established at a rate that will provide sufficient income to pay the Committee's expenses.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Committee met June 9, 1993, and unanimously recommended a 1993-94 budget of $90,000 and an assessment rate of $0.02 per crate. The expenses and assessment rate were published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>as an interim final rule July 16, 1993 (58 FR 38277). That interim final rule added ยง967.228, authorizing expenses and establishing an assessment rate for the Committee, and provided that interested persons could file comments through August 16, 1993. No comments were filed.</textblock>
