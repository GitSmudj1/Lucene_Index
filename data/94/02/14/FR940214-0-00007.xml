    <textblock>The Committee budgeted $45,000 to the American Celery Council for promotional and merchandising activities. However, the Council is no longer in business. The Committee subsequently met on October 6, 1993, and unanimously recommended a decrease of $45,000 for promotion, merchandising, and public relations; reducing funding for the category to $15,000. This action reduces the total Committee budget for fiscal year 1993-94 to $45,000.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Committee also unanimously recommended reducing the assessment rate by $0.01, for a total of $0.01. This rate, when applied to anticipated shipments of 4,500,000 crates, will yield $45,000 in assessment income. Funds in the Committee's authorized reserve as of July 31, 1992, were $27,853, which is within the maximum permitted by the order of one marketing year's expenses.</textblock>
    <textblock>An amended interim final rule was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on November 24, 1993 (58 FR 62033). That interim final rule amended ยง967.228 to decrease the level of authorized expenses and reduce the assessment rate for the Committee. That rule provided that interested persons could file comments through December 27, 1993. No comments were received.</textblock>
    <textblock>While this action will impose some additional costs on handlers, the costs are in the form of uniform assessments on handlers. Some of the additional costs may be passed on to producers. However, these costs will be offset by the benefits derived by the operation of the marketing order. Therefore, the Administrator of the AMS has determined that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>After consideration of all relevant matter presented, including the information and recommendations submitted by the Committee and other available information, it is hereby found that this rule, as hereinafter set forth, will tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>It is further found that good cause exists for not postponing the effective date of this action until 30 days after publication in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(5 U.S.C. 553) because the Committee needs to have sufficient funds to pay its expenses which are incurred on a continuous basis. The 1993-94 fiscal year began on August 1, 1993. The marketing order requires that the rate of assessment for the fiscal period apply to all assessable celery handled during the fiscal year. In addition, handlers are aware of this action which was recommended by the Committee at a public meeting and published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>as an amended interim final rule.</textblock>
