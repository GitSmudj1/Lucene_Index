    <textblock>Field Services states that El Paso is filing concurrently with its petition an application under Section 7(b) of the Natural Gas Act to abandon, effective January 1, 1996, certain certificated facilities which are used to perform the gathering and production area services.</textblock>
    <textblock>Field Services asserts that it has been established and organized to provide, on a stand-alone basis, non-jurisdictional production area services and upon the transfer of the facilities described in its petition, will effectively step into El Paso's shoes with respect to gathering and other production area services now being provided by El Paso and will continue to provide these services on an uninterrupted basis.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment date:</textblock>
    <textblock>February 25, 1994, in accordance with the first paragraph of Standard Paragraph F at the end of this notice.</textblock>
    <textblock>Standard Paragraphs</textblock>
    <textblock>F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before the comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.</textblock>
    <textblock>Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of</textblock>
    <textblock>the certificate and/or permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the procedure herein provided for, unless otherwise advised, it will be unnecessary for applicant to appear or be represented at the hearing.</textblock>
    <textblock>G. Any person or the Commission's staff may, within 45 days after issuance of the instant notice by the Commission, file pursuant to Rule 214 of the Commission's Procedural Rules (18 CFR 385.214) a motion to intervene or notice of intervention and pursuant to ยง157.205 of the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) a protest to the request. If no protest is filed within the time allowed therefor, the proposed activity shall be deemed to be authorized effective the day after the time allowed for filing a protest. If a protest is filed and not withdrawn within 30 days after the time allowed for filing a protest, the instant request shall be treated as an application for authorization pursuant to</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง7 of the Natural Gas Act.</textblock>
