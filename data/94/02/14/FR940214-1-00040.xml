    <textblock>The preliminary revisions underwent concurrent public</textblock>
    <textblock>review and committee balloting which lasted 2 months. The</textblock>
    <textblock>final revisions also underwent public review and committee</textblock>
    <textblock>balloting and were approved May 3, 1993. A quorum of</textblock>
    <textblock>two-thirds of the subcommittee was necessary to vote the</textblock>
    <textblock>document's approval.</textblock>
    <textblock>The announcement of the 1993 edition of ``Recommended</textblock>
    <textblock>Practice for Reuse of Hemodialyzers'' was made in the ``AAMI</textblock>
    <textblock>News'', the ``American National Standards Institute Reporter'',</textblock>
    <textblock>and in press releases to 500 trade journals. The 1993</textblock>
    <textblock>edition (ANSI/AAMI RD47) may be purchased from AAMI,</textblock>
    <textblock>3300 Washington Boulevard, suite 400, Arlington, Virginia</textblock>
    <textblock>22201-4598. Upon final approval of the incorporation by</textblock>
    <textblock>reference, the 1993 edition will be available for inspection</textblock>
    <textblock>at the HCFA Information Resource Center, 6325 Security</textblock>
    <textblock>Boulevard, Room G-10-A East High Rise Building, Baltimore,</textblock>
    <textblock>MD 21207, or the Office of the Federal Register, 800 North</textblock>
    <textblock>Capitol Street, NW., suite 700, Washington, DC.</textblock>
    <textblock>The 1993 edition is directed to the physician in charge</textblock>
    <textblock>of hemodialyzer reprocessing by either the manual or</textblock>
    <textblock>automated method and describes the essential elements of</textblock>
    <textblock>good practices for reprocessing dialyzers to help assure</textblock>
    <textblock>device safety and effectiveness. Some of the salient</textblock>
    <textblock>changes included in the document are:</textblock>
    <textblock>•New Occupational Safety and Health Administration</textblock>
    <textblock>(OSHA) recommended environmental exposure limits of</textblock>
    <textblock>chemicals;</textblock>
    <textblock>•Significant simplification and clarification of the</textblock>
    <textblock>process of validating indirect performance measurements;</textblock>
    <textblock>•A new section on equipment safety that recommends</textblock>
    <textblock>testing the function of the reprocessing system after repair</textblock>
    <textblock>of automated equipment unless a system has an autotest mode;</textblock>
    <textblock>•A definition for ``rebound'' that describes the</textblock>
    <textblock>disinfectant rebound effect;</textblock>
    <textblock>•Revisions regarding use, testing, and removal of</textblock>
    <textblock>chemical germicide and more detailed specifications on</textblock>
    <textblock>germicides involved in reuse;</textblock>
    <textblock>•An expanded section on safety monitoring of clinical</textblock>
    <textblock>test results;</textblock>
    <textblock>•Several new bibliographical references;</textblock>
    <textblock>•Appendices that list the rationales for the revised</textblock>
    <textblock>sections and include a new basic formaldehyde assay test</textblock>
    <textblock>method; and</textblock>
    <textblock>•Revised requirements for personnel qualifications and</textblock>
    <textblock>training, patient considerations, water and reprocessing</textblock>
    <textblock>equipment.</textblock>
    <textblock>V. Provisions of the Proposed Regulations</textblock>
    <textblock>We propose to revise §405.2140(a)(5) to require that</textblock>
    <textblock>ESRD facilities meet the AAMI standards on water quality</textblock>
    <textblock>found in sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2, and B1-B5 of Appendix B of</textblock>
    <textblock>``Hemodialysis Systems'' (2nd Edition) which would be</textblock>
    <textblock>incorporated by reference. We would indicate that copies of</textblock>
    <textblock>this publication may be purchased from AAMI and are</textblock>
    <textblock>available for inspection at the HCFA Information Resource</textblock>
    <textblock>Center or the Office of the Federal Register.</textblock>
    <textblock>In §405.2150(a)(1), we propose to require ESRD</textblock>
    <textblock>facilities reusing hemodialyzers to meet the 1993 edition of</textblock>
    <textblock>the AAMI guidelines on ``Recommended Practice for Reuse of</textblock>
    <textblock>Hemodialyzers'' which we propose to incorporate by reference.</textblock>
    <textblock>We would indicate that copies of the 1993 edition may be</textblock>
    <textblock>purchased from AAMI and are available for inspection at the</textblock>
    <textblock>HCFA Information Resource Center or the Office of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register.</textblock>
    <textblock>We would remove §405.2150(a)(2) concerning staff</textblock>
    <textblock>exposure to chemical germicides, paragraph (a)(3)(iii)</textblock>
    <textblock>concerning reporting adverse patient reactions to the</textblock>
    <textblock>manufacturer; and paragraph (b) concerning the standard for</textblock>
    <textblock>dialyzer caps. These topics are covered in the following</textblock>
    <textblock>sections of the revised 1993 AAMI guidelines which would be</textblock>
    <textblock>incorporated by reference:</textblock>
    <textblock>•Section 8_Physical plant and environmental safety</textblock>
    <textblock>considerations</textblock>
    <textblock>•Section 11_Reprocessing</textblock>
    <textblock>•Section 13_Monitoring</textblock>
    <textblock>•Annex A_Section A11.4_Germicide.</textblock>
    <textblock>VI. Response to Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>Because of the large number of items of correspondence</textblock>
    <textblock>we normally receive on a proposed rule, we are not able to</textblock>
    <textblock>acknowledge or respond to them individually. However, we</textblock>
    <textblock>will consider all comments that we receive by the date and</textblock>
    <textblock>time specified in the</textblock>
    <textblock>DATES</textblock>
    <textblock>section of this preamble, and</textblock>
    <textblock>if we proceed with the final rule, we will respond to the</textblock>
    <textblock>comments in the preamble to the final rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>VII. Collection of Information Requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule contains no information collection</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements. Consequently, this rule need not be reviewed</textblock>
    <textblock>by the Office of Management and Budget under the authority</textblock>
    <textblock>of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501</textblock>
    <textblock>et</textblock>
    <textblock>seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>).</textblock>
