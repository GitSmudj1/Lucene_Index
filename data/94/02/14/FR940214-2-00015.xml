    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>Interested parties are hereby notified that the District Engineer, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, has prepared a Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (FPEIS) for the U.S. Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) regarding Joint Training Exercise Roving Sands (RS) proposed to be conducted at Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range. This EIS addresses the next five RS exercises as well as potential uses of RS sites by 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and 11th Air Defense Artillery (ADA) Brigade.</textblock>
    <textblock>Proposed action: Roving Sands is an annual training exercise coordinated by the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, sponsored by FORSCOM, and executed by the 11th ADA Brigade. The exercise will take place at Fort Bliss, Texas and New Mexico; White Sands Missile Range, Holloman Air Force Base, and Roswell, New Mexico. Most of the ground activity will occur on established Fort Bliss training areas. As many as 10,000 Army, Air Force, Navy, and Marine personnel will participate in the exercise, with about 200 aircraft and 3,000 wheeled vehicles. Roving Sands is scheduled to be conducted during the April-June time period each year. The exercise will last approximately three weeks. Actual force employment and field training will be approximately 11 days. This action does not involve a discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States or wetlands and no evaluation into Section 404(b)(1) of the Clean Water Act is required. Cultural and biological surveys have been conducted to satisfy pertinent statutory and regulatory requirements pertaining to historical and archaeological resources as well as threatened and endangered species and critical habitats. No threatened or endangered species or cultural resources would be affected by this action. Advance planning has been used to avoid any sites which are environmentally sensitive.</textblock>
