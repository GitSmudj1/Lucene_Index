    <textblock>C. For the purpose of minimizing the impact on plant operators, clarification of ERDS data will be pursued through the NRC.</textblock>
    <textblock>VI. Implementation</textblock>
    <textblock>KDHE, KDEP, and the NRC agree to work in concert to assure that the following communications and information exchange protocol regarding the NRC ERDS are followed.</textblock>
    <textblock>A. KDHE, KDEP, and the NRC agree in good faith to make available to each other information within the intent and scope of this Agreement.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. NRC, KDHE and KDEP agree to meet as necessary to exchange information on matters of common concern pertinent to this Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed, such meetings will be held in the NRC Operations Center. The affected utilities will be kept informed of pertinent information covered by this Agreement.</textblock>
    <textblock>C. To preclude the premature public release of sensitive information, NRC, KDHE and KDEP will protect sensitive information to the extent permitted by the Federal Freedom of Information Act, the State Freedom of Information Act, 10 CFR 2.790, and other applicable authority.</textblock>
    <textblock>D. NRC will conduct periodic tests of licensee ERDS data links. A copy of the test schedule will be provided to KDHE by the NRC. KDHE may test its ability to access ERDS data during these scheduled tests, or may schedule independent tests of the State link with the NRC.</textblock>
    <textblock>E. NRC will provide access to ERDS for emergency exercises with reactor units capable of transmitting exercise data to ERDS. For exercises in which the NRC is not participating, KDHE will coordinate with NRC in advance to ensure ERDS availability. NRC reserves the right to preempt ERDS use for any exercise in progress in the event of an actual event at any licensed nuclear power plant.</textblock>

These individuals may designate appropriate staff representatives for the purpose of administering this Agreement.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Identification of these contacts is not intended to restrict communication between NRC, KDHE and KDEP staff members on technical and other day-to-day activities.</textblock>
    <textblock>VIII. Resolution of Disagreements</textblock>
    <textblock>A. If disagreements arise about matters within the scope of this Agreement, NRC, KDHE and KDEP will work together to resolve these differences.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Resolution of differences between the State and NRC staff over issues arising out of this Agreement will be the initial responsibility of the NRC Division of Operational Assessment management.</textblock>
    <textblock>C. Differences which cannot be resolved in accordance with Sections VIII.A and VIII.B will be reviewed and resolved by the Director, Office for Analysis and Evaluation of Operational Data.</textblock>
