    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has amended its regulations concerning procedural due process and appellate rights. The change adds three exceptions to the general requirement that a pretermination/reduction notice must be sent to a claimant prior to accomplishing an action adversely affecting benefit payments. The intended effects of the change are to allow earlier adjudicative response in certain situations and to reduce the amount of potential overpayments.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>VA published a proposal to amend 38 CFR 3.103(b)(3) in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of July 15, 1993 (58 FR 38104-06). Interested persons were invited to submit written comments on or before August 16, 1993. No comments were received, and the amendments are adopted as proposed.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary hereby certifies that these regulatory amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities as they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612. The reason for this certification is that these amendments would not directly affect any small entities. Only VA beneficiaries could be directly affected. Therefore, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), these amendments are exempt from the initial and final regulatory flexibility analysis requirements of sections 603 and 604.</textblock>
    <textblock>There is no affected Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number.</textblock>
    <textblock>List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 3</textblock>
