    <textblock>3. Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. CP94-205-000]</textblock>
    <textblock>Take notice that on January 31, 1994, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee), P.O. Box 2511, Houston, Texas 77252, filed a prior notice request with the Commission in Docket No. CP94-205-000 pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (NGA) for authorization to operate three existing delivery point facilities (which were constructed under Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978) under Tennessee's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-413-000 pursuant to Section 7 of the NGA, all as more fully set forth in the request which is open to public inspection.</textblock>
    <textblock>Tennessee proposes to operate the Franklin Gas Lift delivery point in St. Mary Parish, Louisiana; the Hurricane Sales delivery point in Putnam County, West Virginia; and the Plymouth Sales delivery point in San Patricio County, Texas, under its blanket certificate. Tennessee asserts that since it now renders significant transportation service under its Subpart G blanket certificate, operation of the delivery points would provide more flexibility in using its facilities to the benefit of all customers on Tennessee's system. Tennessee states that the delivery of natural gas volumes through these existing delivery points would not impact Tennessee's peak day and annual deliveries; that its tariff permits the proposed activity; and that it has sufficient capacity to accommodate the proposed changes without detriment or disadvantage to Tennessee's other customers.</textblock>
