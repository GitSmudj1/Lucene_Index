  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. This proposal would require installation of new fairlead assemblies and P-clips; inspection to detect damage of the wiring harness at the wing rear spars; repair or replacement of any damaged wiring harness with a new wiring harness assembly; and verification of the position of the currently installed P-clips, and repositioning, if necessary. This proposal is prompted by a report of abrasion of an electrical power cable in the wiring harness at the wing rear spar. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent abrasion of electrical power cables in the wiring harnesses at the wing rear spars, which could lead to a dormant failure of emergency fuel and hydraulic shutoff services.</textblock>
