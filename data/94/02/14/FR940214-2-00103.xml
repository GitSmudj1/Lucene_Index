    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The following is a summary of the application. The complete application is available for a fee from the Commission's Public Reference Branch.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicants' Representations</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Transamerica is a stock life insurance company incorporated under the laws of California in 1906.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. The Separate Account was established by Transamerica on September 28, 1993. Schwab will serve as the distributor and principal underwriter of the Contracts.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The Contract is a flexible purchase payment deferred variable annuity which can be purchased on a non-tax qualified basis or used as a funding vehicle in connection with certain retirement plans which qualify for favorable income tax treatment. Purchase payments under the Contracts will be allocated to one or more sub-accounts of the Separate Account. The initial purchase payment under a Contract must be at least $5,000. Additional purchase payments of at least $1,000 each may be made at any time before the annuity date.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Each Contract contains death benefit provisions that provide a benefit equal to the greatest of (a) the sum of all purchase payments, less the sum of all withdrawals and any applicable premium or similar taxes, or (b) the account value, as of the end of the valuation period during which the later of (1) due proof of death is received and (2) the receipt of a written notice of the method of settlement elected by the beneficiary.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. A Transfer fee of $10 will be deducted under the Contract for each transfer in excess of 10 per Contract year. Transamerica will also deduct an annual Contract charge of $25 for each Contract at the end of each Contract Year for administrative services. While Transamerica does not currently impose an Administrative Expense Charge, it reserves the right to deduct such a charge on a daily basis in the future from the assets of the Separate Account. However, the Administrative Expense Charge is guaranteed not to exceed an effective annual rate of 0.15% of the average net assets held in each sub-account. Transamerica does not anticipate any profit from these charges. Transamerica will deduct the administrative charges in reliance upon and in compliance with Rule 26a-1 under the 1940 Act.</textblock>
