    <textblock>Abbreviated Rulemaking Actions_Atlantic Sea Scallops</textblock>
    <textblock>The Council will consider framework adjustments to management measures under the framework for abbreviated rulemaking described in the final rule for Amendment 4 to the FMP for Atlantic Sea Scallops (59 FR 2757, January 19, 1994). The Council will determine whether adjustments, or additional management measures are necessary to protect small scallops in the Mid-Atlantic region. The Council will receive findings and recommendations from its Plan Development Team for Atlantic Sea Scallops, which met on February 4, 1994. Additionally, the Council will determine whether adjustments or additional management measures are necessary to address possible problems with double-linking of rings in the dredge bags, the availability of 51/2 inch (13.97 cm) twine tops and the increase of at-sea freezing of scallops.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Council's recommendation on adjustments to, or addition of, management measures must come from one or more of the following categories:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Days at sea changes (total or average);</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Shell height;</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Offloading window re-instatement;</textblock>
