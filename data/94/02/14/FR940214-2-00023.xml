    <textblock>In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (Commission's) regulations, 18 CFR part 380 (Order No. 486, 52 FR 47897), the Office of Hydropower Licensing has reviewed the application for a new license for the existing Niangua Hydroelectric Project, located on the Niangua River in Camden County, Missouri near the city of Camdenton, and has prepared a Draft Environmental Assessment (DEA) for the project. In the DEA, the Commission's staff has analyzed the existing and potential future environmental impacts of the project and has concluded that approval of the project, with appropriate environmental protective or enhancement measures, would not constitute a major federal action that would significantly affect quality of the human environment.</textblock>
    <textblock>Copies of the DEA are available for the review in the Public Reference Branch, room 3104, of the Commission's offices at 941 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any comments should be filed within 45 days from the date of this notice and should be addressed to Lois D. Cashell, Secretary, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. Please affix ``Niangua Hydroelectric Project, FERC No. 2561-003'' to all comments. For further information, contact Joe Davis, Environmental Coordinator, at (202) 219-2865.</textblock>
