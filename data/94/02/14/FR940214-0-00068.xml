    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On August 2, 1993, the Food Safety and Inspection Service published a final rule (58 FR 41138) which amended part 318 of the Federal meat regulations by adding a new ยง318.23 (9 CFR 318.23) which prescribes heat-processing procedures, cooking instructions, and cooling, handling, and storage requirements for uncured meat patties. The rule also amended part 320 of the Federal meat inspection regulations (9 CFR 320) by adding a new ยง320.1(b)(7) (9 CFR 320.1(b)(7)) which prescribes the records to be kept by establishments. There was one numbering error in that section. The section number is corrected as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง320.1</textblock>
    <textblock>[Corrected]</textblock>
    <textblock>On page 41152, in the third column, in part 320 under ``4.'' the ``(b)(7)'' in the second line should read ``(b)(9).''</textblock>
