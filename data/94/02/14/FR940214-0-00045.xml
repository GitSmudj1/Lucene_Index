    <textblock>(14) Total on-site parking spaces per living unit will be within the following ranges unless otherwise required by local authorities:</textblock>
    <textblock>Note:</textblock>
    <textblock>Additional spaces for visitors, staff, or health care workers may be provided.</textblock>
    <textblock>(15) Management, maintenance, and community rooms should be in accordance with Guide 2 of subpart A of part 1924 of this chapter (available in any FmHA office). Laundry rooms should be no larger than necessary to accommodate equipment, circulation (including handicapped accessibility) and areas for sorting and folding clothes.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Type of housing.</textblock>
    <textblock>All housing will be designed to:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Be economically constructed and not of elaborate design or materials. All new construction will conform with the applicable development standards of §1924.5(d)(1) of subpart A of part 1924 of this chapter. The gross square foot living area of new units will be within the ranges listed below. Living area is defined as: All enclosed space for the unit (except unfinished storage space for outdoor items and space needed for heating and/or cooling equipment) and measured from the exterior surface of the framing of exterior walls and the center line of interior party or corridor walls. States should establish ranges within these dimensions to be commensurate with unit sizes in the local market. For example, when conventional units in the market are at the low end of FmHA's range scale, FmHA will also build a comparably smaller unit.</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) An additional 100 to 120 square feet of living area may be added to the 4-bedroom unit guideline for each bedroom in excess of four. Floor areas for living and dining rooms should comply with Guide 2 of subpart A of part 1924 of this chapter (available in any FmHA office). The maximum square footage in congregate housing units will not exceed 110 percent of the minimum square footages listed above.</textblock>

    <textblock>Loan resolution or loan agreement.</textblock>
    <textblock>The loan resolution or loan agreement contains provisions of policy and procedure which should be carefully read, fully understood by the applicant, and executed by the applicant prior to loan approval. If any provisions are not appropriate to a particular case, proposed substitute language must be approved by FmHA and OGC. Subpart C of part 1930 of this chapter provides for the maintenance of certain accounts and the pledge of housing income as security. It contains regulatory provisions governing and giving FmHA power to impose requirements regarding the housing and related operations of the applicant. All sections and requirements determined applicable by OGC will form part of any other loan resolution or agreement that may be submitted by the applicant. These are:</textblock>

    <textblock>(3) Feasibility for projects receiving tax credits will require a more extensive examination since tax credits are predicated on renting to very-low income persons. Applicants choosing to apply for tax credits will be responsible for identifying the amount of tax credits it anticipates requesting from the State, as well as the income percentage on which the credits will be based, and the percentage of units targeted for tax credit eligible persons. The market study must substantiate the presence of persons whose incomes would qualify for tax credits who cannot afford the basic rent and those persons whose incomes are tax credit eligible but who are still able to afford the basic rent.</textblock>
