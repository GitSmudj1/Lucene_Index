    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>In the Rules and Regulations portion of this</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and</textblock>
    <textblock>Firearms (ATF) is issuing temporary regulations regarding</textblock>
    <textblock>the implementation of Public Law 103-159,</textblock>
    <textblock>including the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act,</textblock>
    <textblock>enacted November 30, 1993. These regulations implement the</textblock>
    <textblock>law by imposing a 5-day waiting period before a Federally</textblock>
    <textblock>licensed firearms importer, manufacturer, or dealer may</textblock>
    <textblock>lawfully transfer a handgun to a nonlicensed individual.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulations are also prescribed with regard to reporting</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements for multiple handgun sales, labeling of</textblock>
    <textblock>packages containing a firearm, theft of firearms from</textblock>
    <textblock>firearms licensees, and increased license fees for dealers</textblock>
    <textblock>in firearms. The temporary regulations also serve as the</textblock>
    <textblock>text of this notice of proposed rulemaking for final</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12866</textblock>
    <textblock>It has been determined that this proposed regulation is</textblock>
    <textblock>not a significant regulatory action as defined by Executive</textblock>
    <textblock>Order 12866, because the economic effects flow directly</textblock>
    <textblock>from the underlying statute and not from this notice of</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed rulemaking. Accordingly, this proposal is not</textblock>
    <textblock>subject to the analysis required by this Executive order.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>It is hereby certified that these proposed regulations</textblock>
    <textblock>will not have a significant economic impact on a</textblock>
    <textblock>substantial number of small entities. The revenue effects</textblock>
    <textblock>of this rulemaking on small businesses flow directly from</textblock>
    <textblock>the underlying statute. Likewise, any secondary or</textblock>
    <textblock>incidental effects, and any reporting, recordkeeping, or</textblock>
    <textblock>other compliance burdens flow directly from the statute.</textblock>
    <textblock>Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The collection of information contained in this notice</textblock>
    <textblock>has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget</textblock>
    <textblock>for review in accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3504(h)). Comments on the collection of</textblock>
    <textblock>information should be sent to the Office of Management and</textblock>
    <textblock>Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project 1512-0520, Washington,</textblock>
    <textblock>DC 20503, with copies to the Chief, Information Programs</textblock>
    <textblock>Branch, room 3110, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and</textblock>
    <textblock>Firearms, 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC</textblock>
    <textblock>20226.</textblock>
    <textblock>The collection of information in this proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>regulation is in 27 CFR 178.130. This information</textblock>
    <textblock>is required by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms</textblock>
    <textblock>to comply with the provisions of Public Law 103-159 (107 Stat. 1536). This</textblock>
    <textblock>information will be used to prevent the purchase of</textblock>
    <textblock>handguns by convicted felons and other persons who are</textblock>
    <textblock>prohibited by law from receiving or possessing firearms,</textblock>
    <textblock>which is the purpose of Public Law 103-159. The likely</textblock>
    <textblock>respondents and recordkeepers are individuals and</textblock>
    <textblock>small businesses. Estimated total annual reporting</textblock>
    <textblock>and recordkeeping burden: 516,750 hours. Estimated number</textblock>
    <textblock>of respondents and recordkeepers: 8,213,450.</textblock>
    <textblock>Estimated annual frequency of responses: on occasion.</textblock>
    <textblock>Public Participation</textblock>
    <textblock>ATF requests comments on the temporary regulations from</textblock>
    <textblock>all interested persons. Comments received on or before the</textblock>
    <textblock>closing date will be carefully considered. Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>received after that date will be given the same</textblock>
    <textblock>consideration if it is practical to do so, but assurance of</textblock>
    <textblock>consideration cannot be given except as to comments</textblock>
    <textblock>received on or before the closing date.</textblock>
    <textblock>ATF will not recognize any material in comments as</textblock>
    <textblock>confidential. Comments may be disclosed to the public.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any material which the commenter considers to be</textblock>
    <textblock>confidential or inappropriate for disclosure to the public</textblock>
    <textblock>should not be included in the comment. The name of the</textblock>
    <textblock>person submitting a comment is not exempt from disclosure.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any interested person who desires an opportunity to</textblock>
    <textblock>comment orally at a public hearing should submit his or her</textblock>
    <textblock>request, in writing, to the Director within the 90-day</textblock>
    <textblock>comment period. The Director, however, reserves the right</textblock>
    <textblock>to determine, in light of all circumstances, whether a</textblock>
    <textblock>public hearing is necessary.</textblock>
    <textblock>The temporary regulations in this issue of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal</textblock>
    <textblock>Register</textblock>
    <textblock>amend the regulations in 27 CFR part 178. For</textblock>
    <textblock>the text of the temporary regulations, see T.D. ATF-354</textblock>
    <textblock>published in the Rules and Regulations section of this</textblock>
