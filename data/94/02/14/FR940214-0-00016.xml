    <textblock>FmHA response:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Administrative Notice issued on this subject addressed the percentages for establishing separate amounts for general overhead, general requirements, and builder's profit; this section refers to the dollar amounts which are established as a result of the percentage calculation. The FmHA 1924-13 requires that these three items be listed separately. This section refers to establishing dollar amounts for general overhead, general requirements, and builder's profit and that actual costs for those three items will not exceed their dollar estimates. Language addressing the allowable percentages for general overhead, general requirements, and builder's profit has been added to ยง1944.215(a)(1) of subpart E of part 1944.</textblock>

    <textblock>1. Section 1944.211(a)(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>A number of objections were expressed to limiting the number of preapplications to five. Several respondents supported this proposal. The reasons were many and too numerous to list. One respondent suggested that the limitation be based on applications and not preapplications and that the number be controlled on a State basis. Many persons suggested that the number of preapplications be based on the financial capacity of the applicant and not on the number of preapplications. Other recommendations include a limit of from 3 to 15 preapplications; 5 preapplications and a nationwide limit of 10; 10 preapplications per District; 15 or 20 with no more than 5 funded and/or under construction at one time; and 10 preapplications nationwide except for preapplications accompanied by a deposit equal to 1 percent of the loan. Other respondents recommended no limit be set for preapplications or applications. Several persons recommended returning preapplications which cannot be funded within a set period of months.</textblock>
    <textblock>To illustrate his objection to limiting the number of preapplications, one respondent sent several photographs of FmHA-financed apartment complexes which were not being properly managed. The respondent alleged that these apartments were owned by small developers and the photographs serve as an example of what would happen to the section 515 program if only small developers could participate.</textblock>
    <textblock>FmHA response:</textblock>
    <textblock>The majority of comments were overwhelmingly opposed to restricting the number of preapplications. Therefore, the Agency is not undertaking any changes to this section at this time.</textblock>
    <textblock>FmHA was concerned over the photographs and investigated the respondent's claim. In all cases, FmHA was taking action to correct the management deficiencies. In almost all cases, the developers of the subject apartments were not small developers. In the one case where the developer would be considered a small developer, the State did not feel the management problems were due to the fact the developer was not a large entity. Therefore, we do not consider this particular objection to the proposed rule to have merit.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 1944.211(a)(5)</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>One respondent expressed an opinion that requiring evidence that the borrower has or can obtain the 3 percent borrower contribution at the preapplication stage is premature and should not be required until prior to obligation.</textblock>
