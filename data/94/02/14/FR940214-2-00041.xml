    <textblock>TIMES AND DATES:</textblock>
    <textblock>8:30 a.m.-5:30 p.m., February 25, 1994. 8:30 a.m.-6 p.m., February 26, 1994. 9 a.m.-12 noon, February 27, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>PLACE:</textblock>
    <textblock>Northeast Atlanta Hilton Hotel, 5993 Peachtree Industrial Boulevard, Norcross, Georgia 30092.</textblock>
    <textblock>STATUS:</textblock>
    <textblock>Open to the public for observation and comment, limited only by space available. The meeting room will accommodate approximately 200 people.</textblock>
    <textblock>PURPOSE:</textblock>
    <textblock>Under a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed in December 1990 with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, an MOU was signed in October 1990 and renewed in November 1992 between ATSDR and DOE. The MOU delineates the responsibilities and procedures for ATSDR's public health activities at DOE sites required under sections 104, 107, and 120 of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA, or ``Superfund''). These activities include health consultations and public health assessments at DOE sites listed on, or proposed for, the Superfund National Priorities List and at sites that are the subject of petitions from the public; and other health-related activities such as epidemiologic studies, health surveillance, exposure and disease registries, health education, substance-specific applied research, emergency response, and preparation of toxicological profiles.</textblock>
    <textblock>Community involvement is a critical part of the HHS energy-related research and activities. The availability of a formal site-specific advisory committee composed of citizens of certain affected areas to provide consensus advice to CDC and ATSDR regarding these activities is necessary. CDC and ATSDR are currently taking steps to obtain authorization for a ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at Department of Energy Sites'' to be chartered under the Federal Advisory Committee Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of this workshop is to provide interested parties an opportunity to give individual advice and recommendations regarding: (1) Community involvement between representatives of affected populations, Native American Nations, and CDC and ATSDR; (2) the principles and process of public involvement given the diversities of interests and needs of affected and potentially affected populations and Native American Nations; (3) the concerns and needs which may be common to all; and, (4) provide a public forum for citizens of affected populations. A copy of the proposed ``Citizens' Advisory Committee on Public Health Service Activities and Research at DOE Sites'' draft charter is available upon request from the contact person listed below.</textblock>
    <textblock>Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate.</textblock>
