    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with section 501 of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11411), as amended, and HUD's regulations at 24 CFR part 581, HUD is publishing this Notice to identify Federal buildings and other real property that HUD reviewed in 1993 for suitability for use to assist the homeless. The properties were reviewed using information provided to HUD by Federal landholding agencies regarding unutilized and underutilized buildings and real property controlled by such agencies or by GSA regarding its inventory of excess or surplus Federal property.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under 24 CFR 581.3(b), landholding agencies are required to notify HUD by December 31, 1993, the current availability status and classification of each property controlled by the Agencies that were published by HUD as suitable and available which remain available for application for use by the homeless.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under 24 CFR 581.8(d), HUD publishes a list of those properties reported by the Agencies and a list of suitable/unavailable properties including the reasons why they are not available.</textblock>
    <textblock>Properties listed as suitable/available will be available exclusively for homeless use for a period of 60 days from the date of this Notice. Homeless assistance providers interested in any such property should send a written expression of interest to HHS, addressed to Judy Breitman, Division of Health Facilities Planning, U.S. Public Health Service, HHS, room 17A-10, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857; (301) 443-2265. (This is not a toll-free number.) HHS will mail to the interested provider an application packet, which will include instructions for completing the application. In order to maximize the opportunity to utilize a suitable property, providers should submit their written expressions of interest as soon as possible. For complete details concerning the processing of applications, the reader is encouraged to refer to the interim rule governing this program, 56 FR 23789 (May 24, 1991).</textblock>
