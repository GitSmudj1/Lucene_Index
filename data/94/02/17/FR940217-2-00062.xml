    <textblock>Public Health System Reporting Requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>This program is subject to the Public Health System Reporting</textblock>
    <textblock>Requirements (approved under OMB No. 0937-0195). Under these</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements, community-based nongovernmental applicants must</textblock>
    <textblock>prepare and submit a Public Health System Impact Statement</textblock>
    <textblock>(PHSIS). The PHSIS is intended to provide information to State</textblock>
    <textblock>and local health officials to keep them apprised of proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>health services grant applications submitted by community-based</textblock>
    <textblock>nongovernmental organizations within their jurisdictions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Community-based non-governmental applicants are required to submit</textblock>
    <textblock>the following information to the head of the appropriate State and</textblock>
    <textblock>local health agencies in the area(s) to be impacted no later than</textblock>
    <textblock>the Federal application receipt due date:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) A copy of the face page of the application (SF 424).</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) A summary of the project (PHSIS), not to exceed one page,</textblock>
    <textblock>which provides:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) A description of the population to be served.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) A summary of the services to be provided.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) A description of the coordination planned with the</textblock>
    <textblock>appropriate State or local health agencies.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12372</textblock>
    <textblock>This program has been determined to be a program which is subject</textblock>
    <textblock>to the provisions of Executive Order 12372 concerning</textblock>
    <textblock>intergovernmental review of Federal programs by appropriate health</textblock>
    <textblock>planning agencies, as implemented by 45 CFR part 100. Executive</textblock>
    <textblock>Order 12372 allows States the option of setting up a system for</textblock>
    <textblock>reviewing applications from within their States for assistance</textblock>
    <textblock>under certain Federal programs. The application packages to be</textblock>
    <textblock>made available under this notice will contain a listing of States</textblock>
    <textblock>which have chosen to set up such a review system and will provide</textblock>
    <textblock>a single point of contact (SPOC) in the States for review.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicants (other than federally-recognized Indian tribal</textblock>
    <textblock>governments) should contact their State SPOCs as early as possible</textblock>
    <textblock>to alert them to the prospective applications and receive any</textblock>
    <textblock>necessary instructions on the State process. For proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>projects serving more than one State, the applicant is advised to</textblock>
    <textblock>contact the SPOC of each affected State. The due date for State</textblock>
    <textblock>process recommendations is 60 days after the application deadline</textblock>
    <textblock>for new and competing awards. The granting agency does not</textblock>
    <textblock>guarantee to ``accommodate or explain'' for State process</textblock>
    <textblock>recommendations it receives after that date. (See part 148,</textblock>
    <textblock>Intergovernmental Review of PHS Programs under Executive Order</textblock>
    <textblock>12372 and 45 CFR part 100 for a description of the review process</textblock>
    <textblock>and requirements).</textblock>
