    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Coast Guard proposes regulations to require all U.S. flag oil tankers of 150 gross tons and above and all other U.S. flag ships of 400 gross tons and above, to carry approved shipboard oil pollution emergency plans. These regulations would also require foreign oil tankers of 150 gross tons and above and other foreign ships of 400 gross tons and above, to carry evidence of compliance with Regulation 26 when in the navigable waters of the United States. This proposal would implement the requirements of Regulation 26 of Annex I of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978, as amended (MARPOL 73/78). The purpose of Regulation 26 is to improve response capabilities and minimize the environmental impact of oil discharges from ships.</textblock>
