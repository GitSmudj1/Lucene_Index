    <textblock>Generally, uninspected vessel operators are considered to be small entities. They are typically not part of large diversified corporations, and generally own no more than one or two vessels. When compared to the potential cost associated with the loss of a vessel and/or human life or lives, and in comparison to the cost of most associated equipment necessary to properly and safely operate most of these vessels, the Coast Guard believes the cost of an $1150 to $1350 EPIRB is not considered significant.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, the Coast Guard certifies under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that this proposal, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. If, however, you think that your business qualifies as a small entity and that this proposal will have a significant economic impact on your business, please submit a comment (see</textblock>
    <textblock>ADDRESSES</textblock>
    <textblock>) explaining why you think your business qualifies and in what way and to what degree this proposal will economically affect your business.</textblock>
    <textblock>Collection of Information</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>).</textblock>
    <textblock>Federalism</textblock>
    <textblock>The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal in accordance with the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and determined that this proposal does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism assessment. This notice proposes amending the regulations for uninspected commercial vessels, by requiring certain vessels to carry EPIRBs and visual distress signals. The proposed rule would apply to certain vessels operating in coastal waters, on the high seas, and on the Great Lakes. Since this rule affects specific vessels both inside and outside of state waters, the Coast Guard intends to preempt State action addressing the same subject matter.</textblock>
    <textblock>Environment</textblock>
    <textblock>The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this proposal and concluded that under section 2.B.2 of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, this proposal is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. This proposal is made to enhance the safety of personnel at sea, as well as improving the effectiveness of search and rescue, and is expected to have no environmental impact. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket for examination and copying where indicated under</textblock>
