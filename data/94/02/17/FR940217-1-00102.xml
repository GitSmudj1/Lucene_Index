    <textblock>(F) Falsification, including false certifications, of any</textblock>
    <textblock>document pertaining to the performance of any loan collection</textblock>
    <textblock>activity, including activity that is not required by the HEA or</textblock>
    <textblock>applicable program regulations.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) If the Secretary begins an emergency action against a</textblock>
    <textblock>third-party servicer, the Secretary may also begin an emergency</textblock>
    <textblock>action against any institution under whose contract a third-party</textblock>
    <textblock>servicer commits the violation.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section, after an emergency action becomes effective, an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution or third-party servicer, as applicable, may not_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Make or increase awards or make other commitments of</textblock>
    <textblock>aid to a student under the applicable Title IV, HEA program;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Disburse either program funds, institutional funds, or</textblock>
    <textblock>other funds as assistance to a student under that Title IV, HEA</textblock>
    <textblock>program;</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) In the case of an emergency action pertaining to</textblock>
    <textblock>participation in the Federal Stafford Loan, Federal PLUS, or</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal SLS Program_</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) Certify an application for a loan under that program;</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) Deliver loan proceeds to a student under that program;</textblock>
    <textblock>or</textblock>
    <textblock>(C) Retain the proceeds of a loan made under that program</textblock>
    <textblock>that are received after the emergency action takes effect; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) In the case of an emergency action against a</textblock>
    <textblock>third-party servicer, administer any aspect of any institution's</textblock>
    <textblock>participation in any Title IV, HEA program.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) If the initiating official withdraws, by an emergency</textblock>
    <textblock>action, the authority of the institution or servicer to commit,</textblock>
    <textblock>disburse, deliver, or cause the commitment, disbursement, or</textblock>
    <textblock>delivery of Title IV, HEA program funds, or the authority of the</textblock>
    <textblock>servicer to administer any aspect of any institution's</textblock>
    <textblock>participation in any Title IV, HEA program, except in accordance</textblock>
    <textblock>with a particular procedure specified in the notice of emergency</textblock>
    <textblock>action, the institution or servicer, as applicable, may not take</textblock>
    <textblock>any action described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section except</textblock>
    <textblock>in accordance with the procedure specified in the notice.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e)(1) Upon request by the institution or servicer, as</textblock>
    <textblock>applicable, the Secretary provides the institution or servicer,</textblock>
    <textblock>as soon as practicable, with an opportunity to show cause that</textblock>
    <textblock>the emergency action is unwarranted or should be modified.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) An opportunity to show cause consists of an opportunity</textblock>
    <textblock>to present evidence and argument to a show-cause official. The</textblock>
    <textblock>initiating official does not act as the show-cause official for</textblock>
    <textblock>any emergency action that the initiating official has begun. The</textblock>
    <textblock>show-cause official is authorized to grant relief from the</textblock>
    <textblock>emergency action. The institution or servicer may make its</textblock>
    <textblock>presentation in writing or, upon its request, at an informal</textblock>
    <textblock>meeting with the show-cause official.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) The show-cause official may limit the time and manner</textblock>
    <textblock>in which argument and evidence may be presented in order to avoid</textblock>
    <textblock>unnecessary delay or the presentation of immaterial, irrelevant,</textblock>
    <textblock>or repetitious matter.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) The institution or servicer, as applicable, has the</textblock>
    <textblock>burden of persuading the show-cause official that the emergency</textblock>
    <textblock>action imposed by the notice is unwarranted or should be modified</textblock>
    <textblock>because_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) The grounds stated in the notice did not, or no longer,</textblock>
    <textblock>exist;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) The grounds stated in the notice will not cause loss</textblock>
    <textblock>or misuse of Title IV, HEA program funds; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) The institution or servicer, as applicable, will use</textblock>
    <textblock>procedures that will reliably eliminate the risk of loss from the</textblock>
    <textblock>misuse described in the notice.</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) The show-cause official continues, modifies, or revokes</textblock>
    <textblock>the emergency action promptly after consideration of any argument</textblock>
    <textblock>and evidence presented by the institution or servicer, as</textblock>
    <textblock>applicable, and the initiating official.</textblock>
    <textblock>(6) The show-cause official notifies the institution or</textblock>
    <textblock>servicer, as applicable, of that official's determination</textblock>
    <textblock>promptly after the completion of the show-cause meeting or, if no</textblock>
    <textblock>meeting is requested, after the official receives all the</textblock>
    <textblock>material submitted by the institution in opposition to the</textblock>
    <textblock>emergency action. In the case of a notice to a third-party</textblock>
    <textblock>servicer, the official also notifies each institution that</textblock>
    <textblock>contracts with the servicer of that determination. The</textblock>
    <textblock>show-cause official may explain that determination by adopting or</textblock>
    <textblock>modifying the statement of reasons provided in the notice of</textblock>
    <textblock>emergency action.</textblock>
    <textblock>(f)(1) An emergency action does not extend more than 30</textblock>
    <textblock>days after initiated unless the Secretary initiates a limitation,</textblock>
    <textblock>suspension, or termination proceeding under this part or under</textblock>
    <textblock>34 CFR part 600 against the institution or servicer, as</textblock>
    <textblock>applicable, within that 30-day period, in which case the</textblock>
    <textblock>emergency action continues until a final decision is issued in</textblock>
    <textblock>that proceeding, as provided in ยง668.90 (c) or (f), as applicable.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Until a final decision is issued by the Secretary in a</textblock>
    <textblock>proceeding described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the</textblock>
    <textblock>continuation, modification, or revocation of the emergency action</textblock>
    <textblock>is at the sole discretion of the initiating official, or, if a</textblock>
    <textblock>show-cause proceeding is conducted, the show-cause official.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) If an emergency action extends beyond 180 days by</textblock>
    <textblock>virtue of paragraph (f)(1) of this section, the institution or</textblock>
    <textblock>servicer, as applicable, may then submit written material to the</textblock>
    <textblock>show-cause official to demonstrate that because of facts</textblock>
    <textblock>occurring after the later of the notice by the initiating</textblock>
    <textblock>official or the show-cause meeting, continuation of the emergency</textblock>
    <textblock>action is unwarranted and the emergency action should be modified</textblock>
    <textblock>or ended. The show-cause official considers any written material</textblock>
    <textblock>submitted and issues a determination that continues, modifies, or</textblock>
    <textblock>revokes the emergency action.</textblock>
