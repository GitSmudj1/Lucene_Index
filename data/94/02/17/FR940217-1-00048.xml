    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with Public Law 102-588, NASA has carried out an assessment of the allocation of risk, as currently prescribed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation, between NASA and its contractors for research and development contracts. This assessment included publishing a concept paper in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(58 FR 16715, March 30, 1993) in order to solicit public and Federal comment on options for allocating risk for correction of defects in materials and workmanship or other failures to conform to contract requirements. As a result of public comment and consistent with the requirement of Public Law 102-588 to initiate rule making, NASA is proposing certain changes to the clause, Inspection of Research and Development_Cost Reimbursement, and the associated prescription.</textblock>
    <textblock>Essentially these changes, modified as a result of public comment on the concept paper, are made to the current FAR coverage:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Allocate additional financial risks to the contractor;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Assign the Government the burden of proof when disallowing the costs of correction or replacement;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Define ``routine'' operations clearly; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Prescribe the use of an advance agreement to identify routine operations, to the maximum extent practical.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed clause, which would be used as a substitute for the clause at FAR 52.246-8, Inspection of Research and Development_Cost Reimbursement, for certain procurements, adds two situations under which the Contractor will bear additional financial responsibility to remedy failures to comply with the requirements of this contract: (1) The contractor did not apply best efforts toward the accomplishment of the research and development objectives of the contract, and (2) the contractor did not follow generally accepted industrial or engineering practices in performing routine operations. The contractor's liability will be limited to 50 percent of the cost to remedy the failure or 10 percent of the contract value at the time the failure occurred, whichever is less. The proposed clause differs from the standard FAR clause in paragraphs (a) and (h). Current cost principles preclude the allowability of costs for insurance to cover these potential costs.</textblock>
    <textblock>If after evaluating public comments, NASA decides to adopt the revised clause proposed herein, NASA will also propose and appropriate FAR revision to cover the matter, as required by FAR 1.404.</textblock>
    <textblock>Impact</textblock>
    <textblock>NASA certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>). The regulation imposes no new burdens on the public within the ambit of the Paperwork Reduction Act, as implemented at 5 CFR part 1320.</textblock>
