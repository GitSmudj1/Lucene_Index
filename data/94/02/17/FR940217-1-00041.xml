    <textblock>C. Agenda</textblock>
    <textblock>If the Commission decides to establish a negotiating committee and its charter is approved, it is anticipated that the Committee's first meeting will take place in March or April, 1994, at the Commission's offices, Washington, DC, at a building, room, date, and time that will be announced. At this initial meeting, the committee will complete action on all procedural matters and establish a target date for submission of its recommendations. We expect that the target date would be no later than July, 1994. We anticipate a publication of a Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking not later than October, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>V. Negotiation Procedures</textblock>
    <textblock>The following procedures and guidelines will apply to the Committee, if formed. These procedures may be modified, however, after reviewing the comments received in response to this</textblock>
