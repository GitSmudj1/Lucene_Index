    <textblock>Secretary of Education.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to amend parts 668 and 682 of title 34 of</textblock>
    <textblock>the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 668_STUDENT ASSISTANCE GENERAL PROVISIONS</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 668 is revised to read</textblock>
    <textblock>as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>20 U.S.C. 1085, 1088, 1091, 1092, 1094, 1099c,</textblock>
    <textblock>and 1141, unless otherwise noted.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 668.1 is amended by revising paragraph (a) to</textblock>
    <textblock>read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§668.1</textblock>
    <textblock>Scope.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) This part establishes general rules that apply to an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution that participates in any student financial assistance</textblock>
    <textblock>program authorized by Title IV of the Higher Education Act of</textblock>
    <textblock>1965, as amended (Title IV, HEA program). To the extent that an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution contracts with a third-party servicer to administer</textblock>
    <textblock>any aspect of the institution's participation in any</textblock>
    <textblock>Title IV, HEA program, the applicable rules in this part also</textblock>
    <textblock>apply to that servicer. An institution's use of a third-party</textblock>
    <textblock>servicer does not alter the institution's responsibility for</textblock>
    <textblock>compliance with the rules in this part.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Section 668.2 is amended by adding definitions of ``Designated</textblock>
    <textblock>department official'', ``Initiating official'', ``Show-cause</textblock>
    <textblock>official'', and ``Third-party servicer'' to paragraph (b) in</textblock>
    <textblock>alphabetical order to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§668.2</textblock>
    <textblock>General definitions.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) *␣*␣*</textblock>
    <textblock>Designated department official:</textblock>
    <textblock>An official of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Department of Education to whom the Secretary has delegated</textblock>
    <textblock>responsibilities indicated in this part.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>Initiating official:</textblock>
    <textblock>The designated department official</textblock>
    <textblock>authorized to begin an emergency action under §668.83.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>Show-cause official:</textblock>
    <textblock>The designated department official</textblock>
    <textblock>authorized to conduct a show-cause proceeding for an emergency</textblock>
    <textblock>action under §668.83.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>

    <textblock>automated processing, any aspect of the institution's</textblock>
    <textblock>participation in any Title IV, HEA program. The Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>considers administration of participation in a Title IV, HEA</textblock>
