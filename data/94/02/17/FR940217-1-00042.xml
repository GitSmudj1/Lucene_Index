    <textblock>E. Consensus</textblock>
    <textblock>The goal of the Committee is consensus. The Negotiated Rulemaking Act defines consensus as unanimous concurrence among the represented interests, although the Act permits the Committee to agree to another specified definition. In the event the Committee is unable to reach a consensus, the Committee may include in a report any other information, recommendations, or materials that the Committee considers appropriate, and any Committee member may include as an addendum to the report additional information, recommendations, or materials. Parties to the negotiation may withdraw at any time. If this happens, the remaining Committee members and the Commission will evaluate whether the Committee should continue.</textblock>

    <textblock>. These meetings will be open to the public.</textblock>
