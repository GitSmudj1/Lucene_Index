    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The HRSA in collaboration with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) announces the availability of fiscal year (FY) 1994 funds for grants authorized under section 1910 of the PHS Act. These discretionary grants will be made to States or accredited schools of medicine to support projects for the expansion and improvement of emergency medical services for children (EMSC). Funds appropriated by Public Law 103-112 will be used for this purpose. Under the EMSC program authority, awards are made for project periods of up to 2 years.</textblock>
    <textblock>The NHTSA participated with the HRSA in developing program priorities for the EMSC program for FY 1994. The NHTSA will share the Federal monitoring responsibilities for EMSC awards made during FY 1994 and will continue to provide ongoing technical assistance and consultation in regard to the required collaboration/linkages between applicants and their Highway Safety Offices and Emergency Medical Services Agencies for the State(s). Grantees funded under this program are expected to work collaboratively with the State trauma systems planning and development projects funded by the Bureau of Health Resources Development, HRSA.</textblock>
    <textblock>The PHS is committed to achieving the health promotion and disease prevention objectives of Healthy People 2000, a PHS led national activity for setting priority areas. The EMSC grant program will directly address the Healthy People 2000 objectives related to emergency medical services and trauma systems linking prehospital, hospital, and rehabilitation services in order to prevent trauma deaths and long-term disability. Potential applicants may obtain a copy of Healthy People 2000 (Full Report: Stock No. 017-001-00474-0) or Healthy People 2000 (Summary Report: Stock No. 017-001-00473-1) through the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402-9325 (telephone 202 783-3238).</textblock>
