    <textblock>(2) An audit finding during the servicer's two most recent</textblock>
    <textblock>audits amounting to at least five percent of funds received</textblock>
    <textblock>or administered by the servicer under the Title IV, HEA</textblock>
    <textblock>programs; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) A citation within the preceding five years for the</textblock>
    <textblock>servicer's failure to submit a required audit report within</textblock>
    <textblock>an acceptable amount of time.</textblock>
    <textblock>A third-party servicer that shows these indicators of</textblock>
    <textblock>questionable past performance with regard to the Title IV, HEA</textblock>
    <textblock>programs could not, under paragraph (d) of this section, contract</textblock>
    <textblock>with an institution unless the persons or entities with</textblock>
    <textblock>substantial control over the servicer agree to be responsible for</textblock>
    <textblock>any potential liability arising from the servicer's</textblock>
    <textblock>administration of the Title IV, HEA programs. In the case of a</textblock>
    <textblock>third-party servicer that has been subjected to a termination</textblock>
    <textblock>action, the servicer could not contract with an institution</textblock>
    <textblock>unless either the servicer or persons or entities with</textblock>
    <textblock>substantial control over the servicer (or both) provide financial</textblock>
    <textblock>guarantees (specified by the Secretary) to the Secretary for</textblock>
    <textblock>potential liabilities arising from the administration of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Title IV, HEA programs. These provisions are necessary to hold</textblock>
    <textblock>persons who have substantial control over a third-party servicer</textblock>
    <textblock>accountable for their past performance in the administration of</textblock>
    <textblock>the Title IV, HEA programs.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any contract between an institution and a third-party</textblock>
    <textblock>servicer would have to require the servicer to agree to comply</textblock>
    <textblock>with all applicable Title IV, HEA program requirements, including</textblock>
    <textblock>using any Title IV, HEA program funds that the servicer</textblock>
    <textblock>administers and any earnings on those funds solely for Title IV,</textblock>
    <textblock>HEA program purposes. The servicer would have to agree to refer</textblock>
    <textblock>suspected instances of fraud and criminal activity to the</textblock>
    <textblock>Department of Education's Inspector General. These requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>would parallel those currently required of institutions in</textblock>
    <textblock>establishing an institution's administrative capability but add</textblock>
    <textblock>that the servicer would also have to refer suspected instances of</textblock>
    <textblock>fraud and criminal activity committed by the institution. The</textblock>
    <textblock>contract would have to require the servicer to agree to be liable</textblock>
    <textblock>to the Secretary, jointly and severally with the institution, for</textblock>
    <textblock>any violation by the servicer of any Title IV, HEA program</textblock>
    <textblock>requirement.</textblock>
    <textblock>With regard to third-party servicer liability, a number of</textblock>
    <textblock>negotiators opposed the Secretary's proposed language, submitted</textblock>
    <textblock>to negotiators at negotiated rulemaking, requiring a third-party</textblock>
    <textblock>servicer to share liability with an institution for an infraction</textblock>
    <textblock>by the servicer of any Title IV, HEA program requirement. The</textblock>
    <textblock>negotiators offered three basic reasons for their opposition.</textblock>
    <textblock>First, the negotiators stated that any imposition of</textblock>
    <textblock>liability would improperly interfere with the private contract</textblock>
    <textblock>between the servicer and the institution. The parties, in the</textblock>
    <textblock>view of the negotiators, should be free to decide how and if</textblock>
    <textblock>liability should be divided without Federal regulatory</textblock>
    <textblock>prescription.</textblock>
