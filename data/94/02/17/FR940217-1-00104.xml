    <textblock>(1) The Secretary may suspend</textblock>
    <textblock>an institution's participation in a Title IV, HEA program or the</textblock>
    <textblock>eligibility of a third-party servicer to contract with any</textblock>
    <textblock>institution to administer any aspect of the institution's</textblock>

    <textblock>a third-party servicer, the Secretary also may begin a fine,</textblock>
    <textblock>limitation, suspension, or termination proceeding against any</textblock>
    <textblock>institution under whose contract a third-party servicer commits</textblock>
    <textblock>the violation.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) The suspension may not exceed 60 days unless_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) The institution or servicer and the Secretary agree to</textblock>
    <textblock>an extension if the institution or servicer, as applicable, has</textblock>

    <textblock>against a third-party servicer, the official also sends the</textblock>
    <textblock>notice to each institution that contracts with the servicer. The</textblock>

    <textblock>other, more expeditious means if practical. The notice_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Informs the institution or servicer of the intent of</textblock>
    <textblock>the Secretary to suspend the institution's participation or the</textblock>
    <textblock>servicer's eligibility, as applicable, cites the consequences of</textblock>

    <textblock>constitute the basis for the action;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Specifies the proposed effective date of the</textblock>
    <textblock>suspension, which is at least 20 days after the date of mailing</textblock>
    <textblock>of the notice of intent;</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Informs the institution or servicer that the</textblock>
    <textblock>suspension will not be effective on the date specified in the</textblock>
    <textblock>notice, except as provided in ยง668.90(b)(2), if the designated</textblock>
    <textblock>department official receives from the institution or servicer, as</textblock>
    <textblock>applicable, by that date a request for a hearing or written</textblock>
    <textblock>material indicating why the suspension should not take place; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) In the case of a suspension proceeding against a</textblock>
    <textblock>third-party servicer, informs each institution that contracts</textblock>
    <textblock>with the servicer of the consequences of the action to the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution.</textblock>
