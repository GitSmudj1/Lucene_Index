    <textblock>(A) Has a high rate for placing graduates in practice settings having the principal focus of serving residents of medically underserved communities; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) During the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which an award is sought, has achieved a significant increase in the rate of placing graduates in such settings. This preference will only be applied to applications that rank above the 20th percentile that have been recommended for approval by the peer review group.</textblock>

    <textblock>``High rate'' means that 20 percent of the physician assistant program graduates in academic year 1991-92 or academic year 1992-93, whichever is greater, are spending at least 50 percent of their work time in these settings.</textblock>
    <textblock>``Significant increase in the rate'' means that, between academic years 1991-92 and 1992-93, the rate of physician assistant program graduates in these settings has increased by at least 50 percent and that not less than 15 percent of the academic year 1992-93 graduates are working in these settings.</textblock>
    <textblock>Additional information concerning the implementation of this preference has been published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>at 58 FR 40659, dated July 29, 1993.</textblock>
