    <textblock>A funding priority will be given to applications which demonstrate substantial clinical training (a student or resident clerkship or preceptorship of 4 to 8 weeks) in sites that serve the medically underserved.</textblock>
    <textblock>Proposed Funding Priorities for FY 1994</textblock>
    <textblock>It is proposed that a funding priority be given to:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Applicants which demonstrate an increase in the percentage of graduates who have entered a Primary Care (Family Medicine, General Internal Medicine, General Pediatrics) Residency, for the most recent 3-year period.</textblock>
    <textblock>An overall goal of the AHEC Program is to utilize educational interventions to improve the geographic and specialty distribution of primary care health personnel, and thereby increase access to health care to underserved populations. The achievement of AHEC Program goals is enhanced by medical schools (allopathic and osteopathic) which can demonstrate a commitment to increasing the number of students who select graduate training in a primary care specialty (family medicine, general internal medicine, general pediatrics). Such a commitment can be demonstrated in the performance and track record of the applicant medical schools, during a most recent 3-year period. In times of limited dollars, it is reasonable to allocate funds to: (1) Training institutions that have primary care training goals that are consonant with those of the Bureau of Health Professions and the AHEC Program; and (2) institutions that can demonstrate performance in training an increasing number of medical students who upon graduation select a primary care career specialty.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Applicants which demonstrate an increase in the percentage of underrepresented minority graduates for the most recent 3-year period.</textblock>
    <textblock>This funding priority is proposed to encourage the training of underrepresented minorities in an effort to increase the number of underrepresented minorities who are accepted to medical school (allopathic or osteopathic) and complete training. It is assumed that these individuals, following training, are most likely to provide much needed care in medically underserved communities to predominantly minority populations. It is reasonable to provide limited funds to institutions which demonstrate a commitment to increasing the number of underrepresented minorities who graduate from medical school. Such commitment can be demonstrated in the performance and track record of the medical school, during a most recent 3-year period. Current data indicate that the percentage of underrepresented minorities attending and graduating from medical schools is not equal to the percentage of underrepresented minorities in the United States. This priority will assist in addressing the needs of underserved minority populations. The term ``underrepresented minorities'' means, with respect to a health profession, racial and ethnic populations that are underrepresented in the health profession relative to the number of individuals who are members of the population involved. For this program, it means American Indians or Alaskan Natives, Blacks, Hispanics, and, potentially, various subpopulations of Asian individuals. Applicants must evidence that any particular subgroup of Asian individuals is underrepresented in a specific discipline.</textblock>
