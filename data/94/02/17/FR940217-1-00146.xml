    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule implements Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter 92-5, Past Performance Information, which was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>at 58 FR 3573 on January 11, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed changes to FAR Parts 9, 15, and 42 may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.,</textblock>
    <textblock>because the requirements for use of past performance information in contract award decisions may preclude award to otherwise successful offerors. The extent of the impact is not known. An Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been prepared and is summarized as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed rule implements Office of Federal Procurement Policy Letter 92-5, Past Performance Information. The OFPP policy letter requires Federal agencies to evaluate contractor performance on all new contracts over $100,000, to use past performance information in making responsibility determinations in both sealed bid and competitively negotiated procurements, and to specify past performance as an evaluation factor in solicitations for competitively negotiated contracts expected to exceed $100,000. The rule establishes procedures for use of past performance information in the contractor selection process. A satisfactory performance record is a prerequisite to being determined a ``responsible source'' pursuant to 41 U.S.C. 403. The rule will apply to all large and small entities who perform or are interested in performing Government contracts. The rule will impose no new reporting or recordkeeping requirements on large or small entities. The rule implements OFPP Policy Letter 92-5, but does not duplicate, overlap, or conflict with any other Federal rules. There are no known alternatives which would accomplish the objectives of OFPP Policy Letter 92-5.</textblock>
    <textblock>A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has been submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. A copy of the IRFA may be obtained from the FAR Secretariat. Comments are invited. Comments from small entities concerning the affected FAR subpart will also be considered in accordance with section 610 of the Act. Such comments must be submitted separately and cite FAR case 93-2 in the correspondence.</textblock>
    <textblock>C. Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because the proposed rule does not impose recordkeeping or information collection requirements which require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501,</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
