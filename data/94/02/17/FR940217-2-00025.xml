    <textblock>1993 Program Activities</textblock>
    <textblock>In fiscal year 1993, 9 new grants ($933,231) and 14 continuation grants ($1,263,767) were awarded under the International Research and Studies Program.</textblock>
    <textblock>All of these grants are active currently and will be monitored through progress reports submitted by grantees. Grantees have 90 days after the expiration of the grant to submit the products resulting from their research to the Department of Education for review and acceptance.</textblock>
    <textblock>Completed Research</textblock>
    <textblock>The first grants under the authority of section 606 were awarded in fiscal year 1981. Most of the research projects funded in FY 1981 through FY 1990 have been completed and reported in previous annual reports. However, a number of completed research projects resulting from grants made during prior fiscal years have been received during the past year. A listing of this completed research follows. Grants from fiscal years 1990, 1991, and 1992 are still ongoing, or have recently expired.</textblock>
    <textblock>All of the listed materials and reports have been reviewed by Department of Education staff and meet the terms and conditions under which the grants were awarded.</textblock>
