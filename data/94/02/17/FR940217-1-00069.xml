    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to amend the Student Assistance</textblock>
    <textblock>General Provisions and Federal Family Education Loan program</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations. These amendments are needed to implement changes in</textblock>
    <textblock>the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (HEA), and to</textblock>
    <textblock>improve the monitoring and accountability of institutions and</textblock>
    <textblock>third-party servicers participating in the student financial</textblock>
    <textblock>assistance programs authorized by Title IV of the HEA (Title IV,</textblock>
    <textblock>HEA programs). The changes would establish requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>governing contracts between institutions and third-party</textblock>
    <textblock>servicers to administer any aspect of an institution's</textblock>
    <textblock>participation in those programs. In addition, the changes would</textblock>
    <textblock>strengthen sanctions against institutions for violations of</textblock>
    <textblock>Title IV, HEA program requirements and establish similar</textblock>
    <textblock>sanctions for third-party servicers. The changes also would</textblock>
    <textblock>establish standards of administrative and financial</textblock>
    <textblock>responsibility for third-party servicers that administer any</textblock>
    <textblock>aspect of a guaranty agency's or lender's participation in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Family Education Loan programs.</textblock>
