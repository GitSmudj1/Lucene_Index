    <textblock>Take notice that on February 3, 1994, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America (Natural), 701 East 22nd Street, Lombard, Illinois 60148, filed, in Docket No. CP94-215-000, a request pursuant to §§157.205(b) and 157.212 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205(b) and 157.212) for authorization to construct and operate facilities in Moultrie County, Illinois. The facilities would be used as a new delivery point to deliver natural gas transported for Illinois Power Company (Illinois Power), a local distribution company, pursuant to a part 284, subpart G transportation contract between Natural and Illinois Power. Illinois Power would use the gas received as part of its system supply. Natural would construct and operate these facilities under its blanket certificate granted September 1, 1982, at Docket No. CP82-402-000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.</textblock>

    <textblock>F. Any person desiring to be heard or to make any protest with reference to said application should on or before the comment date, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20426, a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214 or 385.211) and the Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.10). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding.

    <textblock>Take further notice that, pursuant to the authority contained in and subject to the jurisdiction conferred upon the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Sections 7 and 15 of the Natural Gas Act and the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, a hearing will be held without further notice before the Commission or its designee on this application if no motion to intervene is filed within the time required herein, if the Commission on its own review of the matter finds that a grant of the certificate and/or permission and approval for the proposed abandonment are required by the public convenience and necessity. If a motion for leave to intervene is timely filed, or if the Commission on its own motion believes that a formal hearing is required, further notice of such hearing will be duly given.</textblock>
