    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Coast Guard proposes to amend the uninspected vessel regulations by requiring an emergency position indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) on certain uninspected passenger vessels and uninspected vessels engaged as vessel assistance towing vessels. The proposed EPIRB requirement would apply to these vessels operating more than 3 nautical miles from the coastline or more than 4.8 Km (3 statute miles) from the coastline of the Great Lakes. However, under specific circumstances, these vessels would be exempt from this proposed EPIRB requirement. The Coast Guard also proposes requiring visual distress signals on all uninspected vessels, not presently required to carry them, when operating in coastal waters.</textblock>
    <textblock>The ``EPIRB's on Uninspected Vessels Requirements Act'' amended the shipping laws of the United States by requiring uninspected commercial vessels to carry alerting and locating devices, including EPIRBs, as prescribed by regulations. By implementing this law, the regulations will provide improved search and rescue assistance during emergency situations, thereby reducing the potential for the loss of life and property.</textblock>
