    <textblock>Of the six creeks providing recharge to Barton Springs, Barton</textblock>
    <textblock>Creek has received the most intense development. The TWC has</textblock>
    <textblock>identified nutrients, fecal coliform bacteria, sediment, oil, and</textblock>
    <textblock>grease in Barton Creek, originating from rangeland, golf course</textblock>
    <textblock>runoff, highway construction, and highway runoff (Barbara Britton,</textblock>
    <textblock>TWC,</textblock>
    <textblock>in litt.,</textblock>
    <textblock>1992). Increases in fecal coliform bacteria,</textblock>
    <textblock>nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus), turbidity, and algal growth</textblock>
    <textblock>have been documented along Barton Creek between Highway 71 and Loop</textblock>
    <textblock>360 and are primarily due to sewage effluent irrigation and</textblock>
    <textblock>construction activities in this area (City of Austin 1991; Librach,</textblock>
    <textblock>in litt.,</textblock>
    <textblock>1990). Changes in the aquatic invertebrate community</textblock>
    <textblock>along this portion of Barton Creek have also been attributed to golf</textblock>
    <textblock>course runoff (Librach,</textblock>
    <textblock>in litt.,</textblock>
    <textblock>1990) and insecticide use (Dr.</textblock>
    <textblock>Chris Durden, Texas Memorial Museum,</textblock>
    <textblock>in litt.,</textblock>
    <textblock>1991). These</textblock>
    <textblock>reported changes are significant because water quality at Barton</textblock>
    <textblock>Springs responds rapidly to changes in the quality of water</textblock>
    <textblock>contributed by Barton Creek. Groundwater originating from Barton</textblock>
    <textblock>Creek remains in the aquifer for short periods before discharging at</textblock>
    <textblock>the springs. Thus, there is little time for dilution or chemical</textblock>
    <textblock>breakdown of pollutants before discharging at Barton Springs (Slade</textblock>
    <textblock>et al.</textblock>
    <textblock>1986).</textblock>
    <textblock>Existing land use in the recharge and contributing zones has</textblock>
    <textblock>resulted in recurring fecal-group bacteria contamination and high</textblock>
    <textblock>turbidity (a measure of suspended solids or sediment) at Barton</textblock>
    <textblock>Springs (Slade</textblock>
    <textblock>et al.</textblock>
    <textblock>1986). Data suggest that bacteria and</textblock>
    <textblock>turbidity at Barton Springs increase significantly during storm</textblock>
    <textblock>events. Stormwater runoff has been identified as the major source</textblock>
    <textblock>of fecal coliform pollution at Barton Springs (City of Austin 1991).</textblock>
    <textblock>The level of nitrates at Barton Springs has also increased slightly</textblock>
    <textblock>from about 1.0 mg/l (measured as nitrate nitrogen) prior to 1955 to</textblock>
    <textblock>the current level of about 1.5 mg/l (Slade</textblock>
    <textblock>et al.</textblock>
    <textblock>1986). Increased</textblock>
    <textblock>nutrients may promote the growth of bacteria, algae, and nuisance</textblock>
    <textblock>aquatic plants (Slade</textblock>
    <textblock>et al.</textblock>
    <textblock>1986), which could reduce the dissolved</textblock>
    <textblock>oxygen available to the salamander. In Barton Springs Pool, the</textblock>
    <textblock>routine cleaning procedure necessary to remove algal growth may</textblock>
    <textblock>itself adversely impact the salamander and its habitat (see further</textblock>
    <textblock>discussion later in this section).</textblock>
    <textblock>High turbidity at Barton Springs has been attributed to</textblock>
    <textblock>construction activity in the Barton Springs segment (Slade</textblock>
    <textblock>et al.</textblock>
    <textblock>1986, City of Austin 1991). Sources of turbidity are believed to be</textblock>
    <textblock>``primarily limited to 126 square miles [326 square kilometers] of</textblock>
    <textblock>the Barton Creek and immediately adjacent watersheds in the recharge</textblock>
    <textblock>zone'' (City of Austin 1991). Sediments have been observed</textblock>
    <textblock>emanating directly from the spring outlets in Barton Springs Pool</textblock>
    <textblock>(Doyle Mosier, LCRA; Debbie Dorsey, City of Austin Parks and</textblock>
    <textblock>Recreation Department; pers. comms., 1993). Potential problems</textblock>
    <textblock>resulting from increased sediment loads include (1) reduction of the</textblock>
    <textblock>salamander's habitat by covering substrates on which salamanders,</textblock>
    <textblock>their prey, and/or certain aquatic plants occur; (2) clogging of the</textblock>
    <textblock>salamander's gills, causing asphyxiation (Garton 1977), and</textblock>
    <textblock>smothering of eggs; (3) filling and blocking of underground conduits,</textblock>
    <textblock>restricting groundwater availability and movement; and (4) exposure</textblock>
    <textblock>of aquatic life to certain heavy metals and other toxins that</textblock>
    <textblock>readily bind to sediments. Contaminants that adsorb to the surface</textblock>
    <textblock>of sediments may be transported through the aquifer and later be</textblock>
    <textblock>released back into the water column.</textblock>
    <textblock>Aside from high levels of fecal-group bacteria and turbidity</textblock>
    <textblock>immediately following storm events, the water quality at Barton</textblock>
    <textblock>Springs is considered to be very good (Slade</textblock>
    <textblock>et al.</textblock>
    <textblock>1986, City of</textblock>
    <textblock>Austin 1991). However, only about 3 to 4 percent of the recharge</textblock>
    <textblock>and contributing zones is currently developed (USGS 1992), and both</textblock>
    <textblock>of these areas are under increasing pressure from urbanization (City</textblock>
    <textblock>of Austin 1988, Veenhuis and Slade 1990). The City of Austin has</textblock>
    <textblock>projected that the Austin metropolitan area will support a</textblock>
    <textblock>population of about 1.9 million by the year 2020, up from 577,000 in</textblock>
    <textblock>1982 (City of Austin Planning Department, in Veenhuis and Slade</textblock>
    <textblock>1990). Further development or urbanization in the recharge and</textblock>
    <textblock>contributing zones of the Barton Springs segment is likely to</textblock>
    <textblock>increase the chance of a major pollution event as well as chronic</textblock>
    <textblock>water quality decline in this area and thus increase the levels of</textblock>
    <textblock>pollutants reaching Barton Creek, other creeks serving as recharge</textblock>
    <textblock>paths, and Barton Springs (see also discussion under Factor D). The</textblock>
    <textblock>USGS (1992) has stated that ``much development is projected for the</textblock>
    <textblock>source area of Barton Springs *␣*␣*. [Thus] changes in water quality</textblock>
    <textblock>of Barton Springs *␣*␣* [are] possible in the near future.''</textblock>
    <textblock>Water quality is highly variable throughout the Barton Springs</textblock>
    <textblock>segment and waters flowing from Barton Springs represent a mixture</textblock>
    <textblock>of these waters, originating primarily from the six streams crossing</textblock>
    <textblock>the recharge zone. Although much development has occurred along</textblock>
    <textblock>Barton Creek near Barton Springs, these waters are diluted by</textblock>
    <textblock>recharge waters from less developed watersheds, such as Onion Creek.</textblock>
    <textblock>Little development has occurred along Onion Creek, which, although</textblock>
    <textblock>farthest from the springs, contributes about 34 percent of the</textblock>
    <textblock>recharge waters (Slade</textblock>
    <textblock>et al.</textblock>
    <textblock>1986). According to the Capital Area</textblock>
    <textblock>Planning Council (CAPCO), Hays County experienced ``tremendous</textblock>
    <textblock>growth'' in the 1980's and has the second highest growth rate in the</textblock>
    <textblock>10-county CAPCO region. Dripping Springs, which is located in the</textblock>
    <textblock>contributing zone between Onion Creek and Barton Creek, ``will</textblock>
    <textblock>likely continue to experience a high rate of growth as development</textblock>
    <textblock>continues along U.S. 290 from the Oak Hill area westward'' (CAPCO</textblock>
    <textblock>1990). As development across these watersheds increases, the</textblock>
    <textblock>ability of the aquifer to dilute pollutants will continue to</textblock>
    <textblock>decrease. This decreased ability will likely be further compounded</textblock>
    <textblock>by increased pumping and/or drought conditions.</textblock>
