Notwithstanding these recordkeeping requirements, a prohibited transaction will not be considered to have occurred if, due to circumstances beyond the bank's or broker-dealer's control, the records are lost or destroyed prior to the end of the six-year period, and no fiduciary of a plan who is independent of the bank or broker-dealer or any affiliate thereof, which engages in a transaction covered by the exemption, shall be subject to the civil penalty that may be assessed under 502(i) of the Act, or to the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code, solely because the records are not maintained by the bank, the broker-dealer, or its affiliate, or are not made available for examination by the bank or broker-dealer or affiliate as required by paragraph (e) below.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph and notwithstanding any provisions of subsection (a)(2) and (b) of section 504 of the Act, the records referred to in paragraph (d) of this Section are available at their customary location for examination, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours by:</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) Any duly authorized employee or representative of the Department of Labor or the Internal Revenue Service.</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) Any fiduciary of a plan who has authority to acquire or dispose of the assets of the plan involved in the foreign exchange transaction or any duly authorized employee and representative of such fiduciary.</textblock>
    <textblock>(C) Any contributing employer to the plan involved in the foreign exchange transaction or any duly authorized employee or representative of such employer.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) None of the persons described in subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall be authorized to examine a bank's or broker-dealer's trade secrets or commercial or financial information of a bank or broker-dealer or an affiliate thereof which is privileged or confidential.</textblock>
