    <textblock>12. PTC, at its discretion, will be entitled at a Fund's Termination Date to sell any one or more of the Fund assets to Penn Mutual for a cash price sufficient to obtain net proceeds equal to the aggregate of the Plan Account Amounts of plans holding units in the Fund. The obligations of the parties under these arrangements will be netted against one another, resulting in a ``swapping-out'' of the entire remaining portfolio at an amount equal to the aggregate Plan Account Amounts.</textblock>
    <textblock>13. Penn Mutual's fee for its minimum yield, liquidity guarantees and Plan Account Amount assurances will be an amount computed on and payable as of pre-set quarterly dates from each Fund. The fee will be equal to the product of the cost of the remaining invested assets in the Fund adjusted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for amortization of premium and accretion of discount, times the Penn Mutual Quarterly Compensation Percentage specified in the applicable Fund Supplement.</textblock>

    <textblock>General Information</textblock>
    <textblock>The attention of interested persons is directed to the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The fact that a transaction is the subject of an exemption under section 408(a) of the Act and/or section 4975(c)(2) of the Code does not relieve a fiduciary or other party in interest or disqualified person from certain other provisions to which the exemptions does not apply and the general fiduciary responsibility provisions of section 404 of the Act, which among other things require a fiduciary to discharge his duties respecting the plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries of the plan and in a prudent fashion in accordance with section 404(a)(1)(B) of the Act; nor does it affect the requirement of section 401(a) of the Code that the plan must operate for the exclusive benefit of the employees of the employer maintaining the plan and their beneficiaries;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) These exemptions are supplemental to and not in derogation of, any other provisions of the Act and/or the Code, including statutory or administrative exemptions and transactional rules. Furthermore, the fact that a transaction is subject to an administrative or statutory exemption is not dispositive of whether the transaction is in fact a prohibited transaction; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) The availability of these exemptions is subject to the express condition that the material facts and representations contained in each application are true and complete and accurately describe all material terms of the transaction which is the subject of the exemption. In the case of continuing exemption transactions, if any of the material facts or representations described in the application change after the exemption is granted, the exemption will cease to apply as of the date of such change. In the event of any such change, application for a new exemption may be made to the Department.</textblock>
