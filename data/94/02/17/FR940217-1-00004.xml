  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to de Havilland DHC-6 series airplanes. The proposed action would require repetitively inspecting the horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket for cracks, and replacing any cracked center hinge bracket. Several reports of cracks in the horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket flange on the affected airplanes prompted the proposed action. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent separation of the elevator control support from the airplane as a result of a cracked horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.</textblock>

    <textblock>Discussion</textblock>
    <textblock>Transport Canada, which is the airworthiness authority for Canada, recently notified the FAA that an unsafe condition may exist on de Havilland DHC-6 series airplanes. Transport Canada reports that the horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket has cracked on several of the above referenced airplanes.</textblock>
    <textblock>De Havilland has issued Service Bulletin (SB) 6/512, dated October 25, 1991, which specifies procedures for (1) inspecting the horizontal stabilizer center hinge bracket for cracks; and (2) replacing this center hinge bracket. Transport Canada classified this service bulletin as mandatory and issued Transport Canada AD CF-92-05, dated February 7, 1992, in order to assure the continued airworthiness of these airplanes in Canada.</textblock>
