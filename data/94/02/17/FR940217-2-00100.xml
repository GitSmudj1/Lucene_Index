    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Exemptive relief for the transactions described herein, as well as for other transactions not covered by the proposed exemption, was requested in an application dated July 18, 1984 (Application No. D-5700) submitted by the American Bankers Association (ABA) pursuant to section 408(a) of ERISA and in accordance with the procedures set forth in ERISA Procedure 75-1 (40 FR 18471, April 28, 1975).</textblock>
    <textblock>In a letter to the ABA dated December 28, 1984, the Department of Labor (the Department) tentatively denied the application. By letter dated June 21, 1985, the ABA modified its application in response to the Department's tentative denial, explaining that it was no longer seeking exemptive relief for foreign exchange transactions between banks and plans where the banks or their affiliates have investment management discretion over the plan assets involved in the transactions. On September 15, 1986, the Department published a notice in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(51 FR 32695), requesting additional information from the public on various issues being considered by the Department in deciding whether to propose a foreign exchange class exemption in response to the ABA application. The comment period ended on February 24, 1987. Seventeen substantive responses to the solicitation of comments were received.</textblock>

    <textblock>On March 20, 1991, the Department published a notice in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(56 FR 11757) of the pendency of a proposed class exemption from the restrictions of section 406(a)(1) (A) through (D) of the Act and from the taxes imposed by section 4975 (a) and (b) of the Code by reason of certain transactions described in section 4975(c)(1) (A) through (D) of the Code. The notice of pendency invited all interested persons to submit written comments concerning the proposed class exemption by May 20, 1991. The Department received nine public comments requesting, among other things, that the Department broaden the scope of the exemption to provide relief for transactions entered into pursuant to standing instructions. In view of those comments, the Department published a notice of public hearing in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(56 FR 46806 (September 16, 1991)). The hearing was held on October 3, 1991. Upon consideration of all of the comments received and testimony offered at the public hearing, the Department has determined to grant the proposed class exemption, subject to certain modifications. These modifications and the major comments are discussed below.</textblock>
