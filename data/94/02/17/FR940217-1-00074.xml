    <textblock>Finally, these proposed regulations would include</textblock>
    <textblock>determinations of misuse of all Federal (as opposed to simply</textblock>
    <textblock>Title IV, HEA programs) funds and State or local government</textblock>
    <textblock>funds. For example, a person determined to have committed fraud</textblock>
    <textblock>in the acquisition of State educational grant funds could</textblock>
    <textblock>foreshadow a potential danger to the Title IV, HEA programs if</textblock>
    <textblock>that person were employed by an institution.</textblock>
    <textblock>These additional requirements are needed to establish</textblock>
    <textblock>appropriate safeguards to protect the Title IV, HEA programs if</textblock>
    <textblock>serious questions are raised about the honesty and lawful conduct</textblock>
    <textblock>of an individual, agency, or organization that contracts with or</textblock>
    <textblock>is employed by an institution.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 668.13␣Factors of financial responsibility.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 498(e) of the HEA introduces the concept of ``substantial</textblock>
    <textblock>control'' over an institution essentially by adopting the current</textblock>
    <textblock>regulatory concept of ``the ability to affect substantially the</textblock>
    <textblock>actions of'' an institution. Accordingly, the Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>substitutes the new phrase where applicable in these proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations. Further, the Secretary proposes to establish that</textblock>
    <textblock>an institution is not considered financially responsible_a</textblock>
    <textblock>condition of participation in the Title IV, HEA programs_if a</textblock>
    <textblock>person with substantial control over the institution_</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Has or had substantial control, either alone or in</textblock>
    <textblock>combination with members of his or her family, over another</textblock>
    <textblock>institution or a third-party servicer that owes liabilities</textblock>
    <textblock>for violations of Title IV, HEA program requirements, if</textblock>
    <textblock>those liabilities are not being properly repaid;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Has family members who, alone or in combination with one</textblock>
    <textblock>another, exercise or exercised substantial control over the</textblock>
    <textblock>other institution or servicer; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Owes liabilities, or members of his or her family owe</textblock>
    <textblock>liabilities, for violations committed by the other</textblock>
    <textblock>institution or servicer, and the liabilities are not being</textblock>
    <textblock>properly repaid.</textblock>
    <textblock>The institution could continue to be considered</textblock>
    <textblock>financially responsible if_</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The person repays a proportion of the liabilities equivalent</textblock>
    <textblock>to the amount of control held over the other institution or</textblock>
    <textblock>servicer;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The institution can establish that the person does not, in</textblock>
    <textblock>fact, have substantial control over the institution; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) The institution can establish that neither the person nor</textblock>
    <textblock>any of his or her family members in fact has or had</textblock>
    <textblock>substantial control over the other institution or servicer.</textblock>
    <textblock>The definition of a family member (as currently defined in</textblock>
    <textblock>§668.13(j)) refers to a parent, sibling, spouse, or child;</textblock>
    <textblock>spouse's parent or sibling; or sibling's or child's spouse.</textblock>
    <textblock>Finally, the Secretary would apply the concepts of</textblock>
    <textblock>``substantial control'' and ``ownership interest'' (as currently</textblock>
    <textblock>defined in section 498(e) of the HEA and §668.13) to third-party</textblock>
    <textblock>servicers.</textblock>
