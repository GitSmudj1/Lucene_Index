    <textblock>February 1, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rand Capital Corporation (``Company'') has filed an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission''), pursuant to section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'') and Rule 12d2-2(d) promulgated thereunder, to withdraw the above specified security from listing and registration on the Boston Stock Exchange, Inc. (``BSE'').</textblock>
    <textblock>The reasons alleged in the application for withdrawing this security from listing and registration include the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>According to the Company, it has determined to voluntarily withdraw from listing and registration on the BSE the shares of Common Stock based on the fact that such shares are currently listed and registered on NASDAQ and, therefore, the listing on the BSE is duplicative, provides no significant advantages to the Company or its stockholders and is an unnecessary expense.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any interested person may, on or before February 23, 1994 submit by letter to the Secretary of the Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549, facts bearing upon whether the application has been made in accordance with the rules of the exchanges and what terms, if any, should be imposed by the Commission for the protection of investors. The Commission, based on the information submitted to it, will issue an order granting the application after the date mentioned above, unless the Commission determines to order a hearing on the matter.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.</textblock>
