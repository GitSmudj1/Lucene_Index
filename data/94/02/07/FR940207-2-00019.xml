    <textblock>Absent a request for hearing within this period, Howell Power is authorized to issue securities and assume obligations or liabilities as a guarantor, indorser, surety, or otherwise in respect of any security of another person; provided that such issuance or assumption is for some lawful object within the public interest, and is reasonably necessary or appropriate for such purposes.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission reserves the right to require a further showing that neither public or private interests will be adversely affected by continued approval of Howell Power's issuances of securities or assumptions of liability.</textblock>
