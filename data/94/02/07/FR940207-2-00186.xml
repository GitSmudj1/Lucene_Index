On March 12, 1993, Shearson Lehman Brothers (``Shearson'') entered into an asset purchase agreement with Primerica Corporation and Primerica's indirect wholly-owned subsidiary Smith Barney. The agreement provided for the sale to Smith Barney and its designated affiliates of substantially all the assets of Shearson and the SLB Asset Management Divisions of Shearson (the ``Transaction''). Upon the closing of the Transaction on July 31, 1993, Smith Barney became the sponsor and distributor or underwriter of the Shearson Funds, which were formerly sponsored and distributed or underwritten by Shearson. Shearson's corporate successor, Lehman Brothers, continues to serve as the distributor of the Lehman Funds. (Smith Barney, Shearson, and Lehman Brothers are referred to as the ``Distributors.'')</textblock>
