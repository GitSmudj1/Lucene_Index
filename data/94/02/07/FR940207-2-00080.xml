    <textblock>III. Federal Register Notice of Approval of State NPDES Program or Modifications.</textblock>
    <textblock>The following table provides the public with an up-to-date list of the status of State NPDES permitting authority throughout the country. Today's</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>notice is to announce the approval of Kansas' authority to issue general permits.</textblock>
    <textblock>IV. Review Under Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the review requirements of Executive Order 12291 pursuant to Section 8(b) of that Order.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, EPA is required to prepare a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for all rules which may have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Pursuant to section 605(d) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), I certify that this State General Permit Program will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Approval of the Kansas NPDES State General Permit Program establishes no new substantive requirements, nor does it alter the regulatory control over any industrial category. Approval of the Kansas NPDES State General Permit Program merely provides a simplified administrative process.</textblock>
