    <textblock>PCC Rules</textblock>
    <textblock>As a result of the substantial diminution of PCC's operations, PCC revised its rules so they accurately reflect the actual functions and services PCC performs. As revised, PCC's rules consist of fourteen separate rules detailing participants' and PCC's rights and obligations with respect to each other.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 1 sets out definitions. Rule 2 discusses membership requirements, including financial responsibility requirements and operational capacity requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 3 details the types of services performed by PCC for its participants.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 4 discusses the procedures by which business operations are transacted between participants and PCC.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 5 provides information on fees and charges. Rule 6 requires annual auditing of PCC's financial statements. Rule 7 describes PCC's clearing fund and the method for assessing participants' contributions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 8 is reserved for future use. Rule 9 contains the provisions governing participants' termination of their memberships with PCC and the conditions under which PCC may cease to act for a particular participant. Rule 10 discusses procedures to be followed in the case of a participant's insolvency. Rule 11 discusses disciplinary procedures. Rule 12 discusses a participant's right to appeal an adverse decision by PCC relating to the termination of the participant's membership, the participant's insolvency, or a disciplinary proceeding. Rule 13 describes various procedures relating to such topics as PCC's authority to delegate its power,</textblock>
    <textblock>PCC's suspension of its rules or procedures,</textblock>
    <textblock>and indemnification of PCC against loss, liability, or expenses.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 14 requires PCC to use its best efforts to maintain insurance of a type and coverage that the board of directors deems appropriate.</textblock>
