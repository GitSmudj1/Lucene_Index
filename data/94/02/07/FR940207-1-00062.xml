    <textblock>EPA believes the NRC and the Agreement States are acting in good faith to implement their commitments under the MOU by amending the site licenses. The license amendments by NRC and the affected Agreement States appear to reflect closure as expeditiously as practicable, thus supporting rescission of subpart T and a determination that the NRC program protects public health with an ample margin of safety. In addition, consistent with their commitments under the MOU, NRC and the affected Agreement States are providing opportunities for public participation in the license amendment process.</textblock>
    <textblock>The license amendments noted in Table 1 reflect consistent application of the dates contained in the MOU. Three exceptions are worth noting. First, although the license amendment for the Atlas site is not complete, EPA is confident that NRC is actively pursuing final resolution of the pending reclamation plan. Pending final approval of a reclamation plan, the Atlas site is continuing to emplace an interim cover on the pile to control radon emissions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Second, the license amendments for the ANC Gas Hills site address two separate impoundments. Consistent with the MOU, the license amendment for the non-operational impoundment contains a December 31, 1994, date for emplacement of the permanent radon barrier. Additionally, an impoundment previously designated as operational for in-situ waste disposal is now non-operational. Emplacement of the permanent radon barrier on this second impoundment is scheduled to be completed by June 30, 1996, well within the seven year goal of the MOU for impoundments which cease operations after December 31, 1991.</textblock>
