    <textblock>Take notice that on January 21, 1994, Questar Pipeline Company (Questar) and Mountain Fuel Supply Company (Mountain Fuel) filed a Joint Offer of Settlement that would modify Questar's gathering rates, as set forth on proposed Substitute Original Sheet No. 7 of First Revised Volume No. 1 and Substitute Eleventh, Twelfth, and Thirteenth Revised Sheets No. 8 of Original Volume No. 3 of its FERC Gas Tariff included in its settlement. Questar and Mountain Fuel state that the settlement is being filed under Rule 602 (18 CFR ยง385.602) and accordingly the Commission will treat the tariff sheets as</textblock>
    <textblock>pro forma</textblock>

    <textblock>Questar and Mountain Fuel state that the settlement would change the rate for gathering services rendered to Mountain Fuel, Questar's local distribution company affiliate, pursuant to a Questar-Mountain Fuel gathering service contract entered into October 11, 1993, and would make the same rates available to any firm gathering customer on Questar's system. Questar and Mountain Fuel state that the Settlement provides that the new rates would be made effective September 1, 1993, the effective date of Questar's new rates under its order No. 636 restructuring in Docket No. RS92-9.</textblock>
    <textblock>Questar and Mountain Fuel further state that the rates are based on the cost of service of the facilities used to provide gathering services to Mountain Fuel and are to be effective through August 31, 1995.</textblock>
    <textblock>Questar and Mountain Fuel state that a copy of the filing has been provided to the parties in Docket No. RS92-9 and to the Utah Public Service Commission and the Public Service Commission of Wyoming.</textblock>
