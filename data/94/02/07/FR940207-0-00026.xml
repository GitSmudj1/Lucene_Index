    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Background</textblock>

    <textblock>III. Public Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>IV. Procedural Requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>In this rule the Department of Energy wishes to more clearly communicate the importance of the protection of the environment, and it wishes to enhance compliance with applicable environmental protection laws, codes, ordinances, and regulations by contractors operating facilities of the Department. To accomplish this, a new clause, Environmental Protection, to be included in DOE contracts was proposed in a notice of proposed rulemaking, published in the August 28, 1991,</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(56 FR 42584), and is now promulgated in this final rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Section-by-Section Analysis</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 970.5204-62 and 970.2303-2(e) provide a clause and clause prescription for the use of the clause, Environmental Protection. To the list of environmental laws and Executive Orders appearing in the proposed rule have been added entries at 970.5204-62(a)(3), at (a)(15) to (a)(19) and at (b)(12) and (b)(13). These refer to laws and Executive Orders that have become effective since the time the proposed rule was developed or that were overlooked at the time the proposed rule was developed.</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Public Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>a. General</textblock>
    <textblock>DOE invited interested persons to participate in this rulemaking by submitting data, views, or arguments with respect to the DEAR amendments set forth in the notice of proposed rulemaking. Comments were received from 8 business firms and universities, many of which are DOE management and operating contractors.</textblock>
    <textblock>b. Safety and Permits</textblock>
    <textblock>Comments were received regarding the proposed coverage on the clause at proposed DEAR 970.5204-2, Safety and Health (Government-owned or -leased facility), and the clause at proposed DEAR 970.5204-29, Permits or Licenses. In part DOE agrees with some of the comments offered and for these and other reasons has decided not to amend the DEAR coverage on these two clauses at this time. Also, conforming amendments, related to the two clauses, at proposed DEAR 970.2303-2(a) and 970.7104-21 will not be made at this time. Should the Department decide to revise these clauses in the future, a notice of proposed rulemaking would be issued.</textblock>
