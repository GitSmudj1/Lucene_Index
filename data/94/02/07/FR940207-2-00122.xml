    <textblock>The proposal provides that to determine whether 50% or more of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market, the CBOE will calculate the trading volume for the previous three months in the related securities which can affect the pricing of the foreign security underlying the ADR option.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the proposal, the CBOE will determine that at least 50% of the world-wide trading volume in a particular foreign security occurs in the U.S. ADR market if the combined trading volume for ADRs overlying any class of the foreign issuer's common stock, occurring in the U.S. ADR market, is not less than 50% of the sum of (1) the combined trading volume for all classes of the foreign issuer's common stock, and (2) the combined trading volume for all ADRs overlying any of these classes of stock.</textblock>
    <textblock>The above noted calculation also will be used to determine if the trading volume in the U.S. ADR market falls below 30% of the world-wide trading volume for the underlying foreign security.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposal also defines the U.S. ADR market as the U.S. self-regulatory organizations that are members of the Intermarket Surveillance Group (``ISG'')</textblock>
    <textblock>and whose markets are linked together by the Intermarket Trading System (``ITS'').</textblock>
    <textblock>The U.S. self-regulatory organizations that currently make up the U.S. ADR market are the Amex, the BSE, the CBOE, the CHX, the CSE, the NASD, the NYSE, the PSE, and the Phlx.</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Discussion</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission finds the proposed rule change is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirements of Section 6(b)(5).</textblock>
    <textblock>Specifically, the Commission finds that allowing options to trade on ADRs, among other things, gives investors a better means to hedge their positions in the ADRs, as well as enhanced market timing opportunities.</textblock>
    <textblock>Further, the pricing of the ADRs underlying ADR options may become more efficient and market makers in these ADRs, by virtue of enhanced hedging opportunities, may be able to provide deeper and more liquid markets.</textblock>
    <textblock>In sum, options on ADRs likely engender the same benefits to investors and the market place that exist with respect to options on common stock.</textblock>

    <textblock>note 6. Under this calculation, the trading volume for any U.S. ADR trading on an exchange that is not part of the U.S. ADR market will be included in the determination of world-wide trading volume, but not in the determination of U.S. ADR market trading volume. The CBOE also represents that it will use its best efforts to discover all markets (foreign and U.S.) on which the foreign security (and any related securities) underlying the ADR options trades.</textblock>

    <textblock>ITS is a communications system designed to facilitate trading among competing markets by providing each market with order routing capabilities based on current quotation information. The system links the participant markets and provides facilities and procedures for: (1) The display of composite quotation information at each participant market, so that brokers are able to determine readily the best bid and offer available from any participant for multiple trading securities; (2) efficient routing of orders and sending administrative messages (on the functioning of the system) to all participating markets; (3) participation, under certain conditions, by members of all participating markets in opening transactions in those markets; and (4) routing orders from a participating market to a participating market with a better price. The exchanges on which Empresas ADRs trade are ITS participant markets. The NASD's Computer Assisted Execution System links NASD market makers, for order routing and execution purposes, to ITS for ADRs.</textblock>

    <textblock>Pursuant to Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, the Commission must predicate approval of any new securities product upon a finding that the introduction of such new product is in the public interest. Such a finding would be difficult for a derivative instrument that served no hedging or other economic function, because any benefits that might be derived by market participants likely would be outweighed by the potential for manipulation, diminished public confidence in the integrity of the markets, and other valid regulatory concerns.</textblock>
