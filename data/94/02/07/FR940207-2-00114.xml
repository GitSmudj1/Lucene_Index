    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Resolution Trust Corporation Completion Act (RTCCA), Public Law No. 93-204, was enacted on December 17, 1993. Section 30 of the RTCCA added a new subsection (y) to section 21A of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. 1441a. Section 30 of the RTCCA provides that a person may execute or modify a contract for goods or services on behalf of the RTC only if the person is a warranted contracting officer appointed by the RTC or a managing agent of a savings association under the conservatorship of the RTC. Section 30 further provides that each such person must provide appropriate certification to parties contracting with the RTC, and that each contract must contain certain notices to the other contracting party regarding the requirements for appointment as a warranted contracting officer and the nature and extent of the warranted contracting officer's or managing agent's authority. Finally, section 30 provides that any contract that fails to meet these requirements shall be null and void and shall not be enforced against the RTC or its agents by any court.</textblock>
    <textblock>In compliance with the RTCCA, the Office of General Counsel of the RTC (also referred to as the Division of Legal Services), has developed a program for warranting employees of the Office, to be referred to herein as ``Legal Officers,'' to execute contracts for legal services, and take related actions, on behalf of the RTC. The requirements to be a warranted Legal Officer, and the nature and extent of the contracting authority exercised by any warranted Legal Officer, are set forth in the publicly available Statement. These may be adjusted from time to time, with corresponding updating of the Statement and notice to the public.</textblock>
    <textblock>There are five levels of Legal Officer, Level V being the highest. In brief summary, the requirements to be appointed as, and to remain, a Legal Officer are a combination of experience, training, and education. The higher the level, the more stringent the requirements, and concomitantly, the greater authority exercised.</textblock>
    <textblock>The amounts of authority granted to each level of Legal Officer are as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Level I:</textblock>
    <textblock>On a per contracting action basis, to:</textblock>
    <textblock>a. Execute contracts with total estimated fees up to $10,000;</textblock>
    <textblock>b. Execute task orders with total fees up to $25,000 under pre-established task order agreements;</textblock>
    <textblock>c. Execute contract administrative changes within the scope of a contract which do not affect delivery, cost, or schedule.</textblock>
    <textblock>Level II:</textblock>
    <textblock>On a per contracting action basis, to:</textblock>
    <textblock>a. Execute contracts with total estimated fees (including options) up to $100,000;</textblock>
    <textblock>b. Execute individual task orders with total estimated fees up to $200,000 under pre-established task order agreements;</textblock>
    <textblock>c. Execute administrative changes to contracts, task order agreements, task orders, and contract modifications including changes in delivery, cost, and schedule, where the fees for the change or modification result in the modified contract not exceeding $100,000;</textblock>
    <textblock>d. Execute contract terminations with total fees up to $100,000;</textblock>
    <textblock>e. Execute contract claim settlements with total fees up to $10,000.</textblock>
