    <textblock>Sections 17A(b)(3) (A) and (F)</textblock>
    <textblock>under the Act require that each registered clearing agency be organized and its rules designed to assure the safeguarding of securities and funds which are in the custody or control of the clearing agency or for which it is responsible. The Commission believes that the proposed rule changes and the steps being taken by OCC and the CCCs to implement them, as described above, are consistent with these sections and will better enable OCC and the CCCs to fulfill their safeguarding obligations under the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>In Section 17A(a)(2)(A) of the Act, Congress directed the Commission to use its authority under the Act to facilitate the establishment of a national system for the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securities transactions and to facilitate the establishment of linked or coordinated facilities for the clearance and settlement of transactions in securities and securities options.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission believes that the proposed rule changes implementing the Second Restated Agreements are consistent with these directives. The proposed rule changes and the Second Restated Agreements provide for the efficient settlement of equity options exercises through the facilities of the equity clearing corporations, without increasing the risks to those clearing corporations or OCC. Coordination of this settlement activity will enable clearing members to avoid the duplicative margining of equity options exercises that occurs today. In addition, the rule changes and the Second Restated Agreements provide for several alternative settlement arrangements (</textblock>
    <textblock>i.e.</textblock>
    <textblock>, the appointing, Canadian, and nominating clearing arrangements) for effecting settlement through the CCCs for firms that are not joint members of OCC and either NSCC, MCC, or SCCP. These alternative settlement arrangements will allow more firms to take advantage of the uniform and efficient procedures provided for by the settlement of options through the automated clearance and settlement facilities of the CCCs instead of through broker-to-broker settlement procedures. Participants also will continue to receive the benefit of a guarantee of settlement on T+1 which will reduce the risk of a contraparty default and will provide early assurance of settlement.</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Conclusion</textblock>
    <textblock>On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the Act and in particular with Section 17A thereunder.</textblock>
    <textblock>It Is Therefore Ordered, pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act, that the proposed rule changes (File Nos. SR-OCC-92-05; SR-NSCC-91-07; SR-SCCP-92-01; and SR-MCC-92-02) be, and hereby are, approved.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.</textblock>
