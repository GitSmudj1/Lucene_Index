    <textblock>The Commission finds good cause for approving Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. Amendment No. 1 merely clarifies how the Phlx will determine whether not less than 50% (or less than 30%, in the case of the maintenance standard) of the world-wide trading volume in the underlying foreign security (as represented by ADRs, common stock and any other related securities) occurs in the U.S. ADR market. The Commission believes that this amendment strengthens the proposal by ensuring that the standard will be applied consistently by all the markets seeking to list ADR options and raises no new issues.</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, because the Commission believes that the amendment makes clarifying, non-substantive changes to the proposal, the Commission finds that it is consistent with sections 19(b)(2) and 6(b)(5) of the Act</textblock>
    <textblock>to approve Amendment No. 1 to the Amex's proposal on an accelerated basis.</textblock>
    <textblock>IV. Solicitation of Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>Interested persons are invited to submit written data, views and arguments concerning Amendment No. 1 to the proposed rule change. Persons making written submissions should file six copies thereof with the Secretary, Securities and Exchange Commission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549. Copies of the submission, all subsequent amendments, all written statements with respect to the proposed rule change that are filed with the Commission, and all written communications relating to the proposed rule change between the Commission and any person, other than those that may be withheld from the public in accordance with the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552, will be available for inspection and copying in the Commission's Public Reference Section, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC. Copies of such filing will also be available for inspection and copying at the principal office of the above-mentioned self-regulatory organization. All submissions should refer to the file number in the caption above and should be submitted by February 28, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>It is therefore ordered,</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,</textblock>
    <textblock>that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-Phlx-93-54) is approved, effective February 7, 1994. Accordingly, the Exchange may submit listing certificates for ADR options as specified herein on February 7, 1994 pursuant to Rule 12d1-3 under the Act and commence trading in the options according to the time parameters established in the Joint Options Listing Procedures Plan.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.</textblock>
