    <textblock>Submission to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission</textblock>
    <textblock>The P-DP rates herein confirmed, approved, and placed into effect on an interim basis, together with supporting documents, will be submitted to FERC for confirmation and approval on a final basis. Western understands that the effective date is less than 30 days after the Deputy Secretary places the provisional rates into effect on an interim basis. A waiver of ยง903.21(b) was requested to avoid financial difficulties, and I concur in that waiver.</textblock>
    <textblock>Order</textblock>
    <textblock>In view of the foregoing and pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Secretary of Energy, I confirm and approve on an interim basis, effective February 1, 1994, P-DP Rate Schedules PD-F4 for firm power, PD-FT4 for firm transmission, PD-NFT4 for nonfirm transmission, and PD-FCT4 for firm transmission service for SLCA/IP. The P-DP rate schedules shall remain in effect on an interim basis, pending FERC confirmation and approval of them or substitute rates on a final basis, through January 31, 1999 or until superseded.</textblock>
    <textblock>Issued in Washington, DC, January 6, 1994.</textblock>
