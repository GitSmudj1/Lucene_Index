    <textblock>Take notice that on January 27, 1994, West Texas Utilities Company tendered for filing a notice of withdrawal of its December 9, 1993 filing in this proceeding because the agreements have previously been accepted in Docket No. ER87-65-000.</textblock>
    <textblock>Copies of the filing have been on Gate City, Dickens, Brazos, and the Public Utilities Commission of Texas.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 18 CFR 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before February 11, 1994.
