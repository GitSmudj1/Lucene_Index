    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The NOAA Office of Ocean and Coastal Resources Management (OCRM) announces its intent to evaluate the performance of the Louisiana and American Samoa Coastal Management Programs.</textblock>
    <textblock>These evaluations will be conducted pursuant to section 312 of the Coastal Zone Management Act of 1972 (CZMA), as amended. The CZMA requires a continuing review of the performance of coastal states with respect to coastal management. Evaluation of Coastal Management Programs requires findings concerning the extent to which a state has addressed the coastal management objectives identified in section 303 (2)(A)-(K) of the CZMA, adhered to its Coastal Management Plan approved by the Secretary of Commerce, and adhered to the terms of financial assistance awards funded under the CZMA. The evaluations will include a site visit, consideration of public comments, and consultations with interested Federal, State, and local agencies and members of the public. Public meetings are held as part of the site visits.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice is hereby given of the dates of the site visits for the listed evaluations, and the dates, local times, and locations of public meetings during the site visits.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Louisiana Coastal Management Program evaluation site visit will be from March 7 to March 11, 1994. A public meeting will be held Thursday, March 10, at 7 p.m., at the Mineral Board Hearing Room, State Lands and Natural Resources Building, 625 North 4th Street, Baton Rouge, LA 70802.</textblock>

    <textblock>Each State, or Territory, will issue notice of the public meeting(s) in a local newspaper(s) at least 45 days prior to the public meeting(s), and will issue other timely notices as appropriate.</textblock>
    <textblock>Copies of the State's most recent performance reports, as well as OCRM's notifications and supplemental request letters to the States, are available upon request from OCRM. Written comments from interested parties regarding these Programs are encouraged and will be accepted until 15 days after the site visit. Please direct written comments to Vickie A.
