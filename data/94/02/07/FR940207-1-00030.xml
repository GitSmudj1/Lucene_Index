    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Board's Access Rules implement the Privacy Act of 1974 (5 U.S.C. 552a). This proposed revision of the Board's Access Rules is a part of the Board's ongoing program to review and update its existing regulations. There have been no substantive changes to the Privacy Act recently, accordingly, there is no need for substantive changes to the Board's Privacy Act Rules. The most significant change proposed to the Board's Privacy Act Rules is the establishment of special procedures for requesting access or amendment to records maintained by the Board's Office of the Inspector General, which was established in 1989.</textblock>
    <textblock>Most other proposed changes are procedural or administrative in nature. The proposed regulation clarifies that the Secretary of the Board is the official custodian of records with the delegated authority to respond to requests for access or amendment, except for requests for records maintained by the Office of the Inspector General. The duplication fees to be charged for documents produced in response to a request for access under the Privacy Act are proposed to be the same as those charged for documents produced in response to a request under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), because requests under the Privacy Act are likely to be processed also under FOIA. (No fees for search or review are proposed, because such fees are not authorized under the Privacy Act.)</textblock>
    <textblock>The Board proposes to change the special procedures for release of medical records to clarify that release of medical records through a licensed physician does not permit the licensed physician to withhold the medical records from the requester. Rather, the licensed physician is expected to provide access to the medical records while explaining sensitive or complex information contained in the medical records.</textblock>
    <textblock>Finally, the proposed rule specifically lists the Board's systems of records that are exempt from certain provisions of the Privacy Act to the extent they contain either law enforcement information or reference information provided in confidence. Following adoption of this proposed rule in final (after receipt and review of comments), the Board intends to review and update the Board's systems of records.</textblock>
    <textblock>As required by Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(b)), a ``description of the reasons why action by the agency is being considered'' and a ``succinct statement of the objectives or, and legal basis for, the proposed rule'' are found elsewhere in this preamble. The Board proposes that the provisions in this rule be applicable to all persons submitting requests for access to information under the Privacy Act of 1974 (5U.S.C. 552a). An exemption for small entities is not appropriate because the Privacy Act protects the privacy of individuals from unauthorized access by any entity. This proposed rule is not expected to have any significant impact on small entities.</textblock>

    <textblock>. Pursuant to section (k)(5) of the Privacy Act of 1974 (5§§U.S.C. 552a(k)(5)), the Board has deemed it necessary to exempt certain designated systems of records maintained by the Board from the requirements of the Privacy Act concerning access to accountings of disclosures and to records, maintenance of only relevant and necessary information in files, and certain publication provisions, respectively 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H) and (I), and (f), and  261a.5, 261a.7 and 261a.8 of this part. Accordingly, the following systems of records are exempt from these provisions, but only to the extent that they contain investigatory material compiled to determine an individual's suitability, eligibility, and qualifications for Board employment or access to classified information, and the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Board under a promise of confidentiality.</textblock>
