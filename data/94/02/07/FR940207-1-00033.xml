    <textblock>PART 107_SMALL BUSINESS INVESTMENT COMPANIES</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 107 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>15 U.S.C. 681 et seq.; 683; 687(c); 687b; 687d; 687g; 687m.</textblock>

    <textblock>Investment Adviser/Manager.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>General.</textblock>
    <textblock>A Licensee may employ an Investment Adviser/Manager as defined in §107.3, subject to the supervision of the Licensee's Board of Directors or general partner(s). Services performed may include management and operating activities. The contract shall specify the services to be rendered to the Licensee and to Portfolio Concerns, and the basis for computation of compensation. Such contract shall therefore be approved annually by the Board of Directors or principals of the Licensee. In the case of a Licensee with outstanding Leverage, the proposed contract, or any material change to a previously-approved contract, shall be submitted to SBA for SBA's prior written approval; any doubt regarding the materiality of a change shall be resolved by submission to SBA. Licensees with no outstanding Leverage shall submit all such contracts, or material changes, to SBA within 30 days of execution for postapproval, pursuant to §107.1004.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Section 107.710 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraph (b)(1) to read as follows:</textblock>

    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Preservation of assets.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Any Licensee may incur reasonably necessary expenses for maintenance of such assets. Additional expenses may also be incurred for the purpose of rendering such assets saleable, and for the payment of prior mortgage interest and/or principal, taxes, and necessary insurance coverage. The right of a leveraged Licensee to incur such additional expenses is subject to the restrictions set forth hereafter in paragraphs (b)(2), (b)(3), and (c) of this section, which are inapplicable to unleveraged Licensees.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Section 107.802 is proposed to be revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§107.802</textblock>
    <textblock>Voluntary capital decrease.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>General.</textblock>
    <textblock>No Licensee may reduce its Private Capital below an amount that is the higher of either the minimum required by the Act or regulations, or the amount necessary to prevent the Licensee from having outstanding Leverage in excess of the limitations set forth in Section 303 of the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Leveraged licensees.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subject to the restrictions in paragraph (a) of this section, a Leveraged Licensee may voluntarily reduce its Private Capital in an amount not in excess of 2 percent thereof in one of its fiscal years. No voluntary reduction of Private Capital in excess of 2 percent in any one of the Licensee's fiscal years is permitted without SBA's prior written approval.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c)</textblock>
    <textblock>Unleveraged licensees.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subject to the restriction set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, an unleveraged Licensee may voluntarily reduce its Private Capital to the applicable minimum specified by the Act or this part, but any such reduction shall be reported to SBA within 30 days.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Section 107.904 is proposed to be amended by revising paragraph (a) to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§107.904</textblock>
    <textblock>Disposition of assets to Licensee's Associates or to competitors of Portfolio Concern.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>Sale to Associate.</textblock>
    <textblock>Without prior written permission from SBA, a Leveraged Licensee shall not dispose of assets (including assets in liquidation) to any Associate. As a prerequisite to such permission, a Leveraged Licensee must demonstrate that the proposed terms of disposal are no less favorable to it than are obtainable elsewhere,</textblock>
    <textblock>Provided, however</textblock>
    <textblock>, That a Licensee without Leverage need not obtain permission from SBA.</textblock>
