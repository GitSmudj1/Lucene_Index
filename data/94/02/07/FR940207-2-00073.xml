    <textblock>Western does not believe this comment pertains to, or has any impact on, the P-DP provisional rates. However, Western has withdrawn the proposal to expand Western's load control boundaries to Basic Substation.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>Western is accelerating repayments to periods far shorter than the average or expected service life of the facilities involved. Capital investments are being amortized over unduly short periods.</textblock>
    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>The PRS program is designed to solve at the lowest rate possible that is consistent with sound business principles. The PRS program is designed to calculate a rate over a 50-year period. However, the program will repay investment in a shorter period of time to minimize interest expense, providing revenue is available to accomplish this. If capital investment repayment was deferred, then interest expense would increase, which could result in a higher rate.</textblock>

    <textblock>P-DP has an additional 30 MW of firm capacity because Hoover is providing the P-DP spinning reserves. However, Western should not transfer revenue to the Hoover project with regard to spinning reserves.</textblock>
    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>Western has researched this matter thoroughly and can find no evidence that Hoover is providing spinning reserves to the P-DP. Although the Consolidated Marketing Plan anticipated that an additional 30 MW of P-DP capacity would be available for sale as a result of consolidated operations within the Boulder City Area (now the Phoenix Area), spinning reserve requirements have not changed. The PAO operations department, in conjunction with a consultant on loan from MWD, is continuing to investigate this issue. Any identified benefits to the P-DP will be reflected in future PRSs.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comment:</textblock>
    <textblock>Customer objects to the continuance of Western's 1989 decision to change the costs for using the Hoover-Basic and Hoover-Mead-Basic transmission lines and Basic Substation from a facilities use charge to the postage-stamp rate for the entire P-DP transmission system.</textblock>
    <textblock>Western should revise its proposed P-DP rate adjustments in a manner that restores the Hoover-Basic and Hoover-Mead-Basic transmission lines and the Basic Substation to a facilities use charge which covers the actual costs associated with use of these facilities.</textblock>

    <textblock>Western does not believe that this comment pertains to or impacts the P-DP provisional rates.</textblock>

    <textblock>The customers are concerned that they may be paying twice for the same service since Mead is already part of the P-DP. Western is already charging Edison $0.624/kW/year for use of the substation under their existing agreement.</textblock>
    <textblock>Response:</textblock>
    <textblock>Western has reviewed the provisions concerning the Mead facilities charges in the P-DP transmission agreements and has determined that there is no double accounting to the customers for the same capital facilities. In determining Mead facilities charges to Parker-Davis transmission customers, the costs of the Mead facilities, replacements, and O&amp;M expenses are first allocated to the P-DP based upon the number of functions used. This allocation is further allocated based upon the transmission capacity as stated in the contracts.</textblock>
    <textblock>Environmental Evaluation</textblock>
    <textblock>In compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) 42 U.S.C. 4321</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.;</textblock>
    <textblock>Council on Environmental Quality Regulations (40 CFR Parts 1500-1508); and DOE NEPA Regulations (10 CFR Part 1021), Western has determined that this action is categorically excluded from the preparation of the environmental assessment or EIS.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12866</textblock>
    <textblock>DOE has determined that this is not a significant regulatory action because it does not meet the criteria of Executive Order 12866, 58 FR 51735. Western has an exemption from centralized regulatory review under Executive Order 12866; accordingly, no clearance of this notice by OMB is required.</textblock>
    <textblock>Availability of Information</textblock>
    <textblock>Information regarding these P-DP rate adjustments, including PRSs, comments, letters, memorandums, and other supporting material made or kept by Western for the purpose of developing the P-DP power rates, is available for public review in the Phoenix Area Office, Western Area Power Administration, Office of the Assistant Area Manager for Power Marketing, 615 South 43rd Avenue, Phoenix, Arizona 85009-5313; Western Area Power Administration, Division of Marketing and Rates, 1627 Cole Boulevard, Golden, Colorado 80401-3398; and Western Area Power Administration, Office of the Assistant Administrator for Washington Liaison, Room 8G-061, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.</textblock>
