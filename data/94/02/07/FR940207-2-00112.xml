    <textblock>Pursuant to its authority under section 5051 of Public Law 100-203, the Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 1987, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board's (the Board) Panel on Structural Geology &amp; Geoengineering will hold a two-day meeting on tectonics on March 8-9, 1994. The meeting, which is open to the public, will be held at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, San Francisco Airport, 600 Airport Blvd., Burlingame, California 94010; telephone (415) 340-8500; fax (415) 340-0599.</textblock>
    <textblock>The focus of the panel meeting will be the methodology, existing results, and uses of probabilistic seismic and volcanic hazard estimates at Yucca Mountain. A site at Yucca Mountain currently is being characterized by the Department of Energy (DOE) for its suitability as the possible location of a permanent repository for civilian spent fuel and defense high-level waste. The DOE has assigned a key role to probabilistic hazard estimation in determining site suitability and the design and licensability of the proposed repository.</textblock>
    <textblock>During the panel meeting, the DOE will discuss probabilistic seismic and volcanic hazard estimation and its uses as presented in two reports: (1) The DOE topical report on seismic hazards assessment and (2) the Los Alamos National Laboratory report on volcanic hazard studies. In addition, the Board has asked for an update on recent seismological and geologic investigations that have a bearing on hazard estimation.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Board has invited other interested parties, such as the state of Nevada, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and their contractors, to comment on the DOE's presentations and present the latest results of similar studies on Yucca Mountain. The Board also has invited a number of eminent outside scientists to provide their views on probabilistic hazard estimation.</textblock>
    <textblock>Transcripts of the meeting will be available on computer disk or on a library-loan basis in paper format from Victoria Reich, Board librarian, beginning April 20, 1994. For further information, contact Frank Randall, External Affairs, Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, 1100 Wilson Boulevard, suite 910, Arlington, Virginia 22209; (703) 235-4473.</textblock>
