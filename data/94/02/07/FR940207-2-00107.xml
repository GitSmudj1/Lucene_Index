    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The NRC has prepared a draft report, NUREG-1022, Revision 1, ``Event Reporting Guidelines, Second Draft Report for Comment.'' The document provides proposed clarification of the immediate notification requirements of 10 CFR 50.72 and the 30-day written licensee event report (LER) requirements of 10 CFR 50.73 for nuclear power plants. This document will replace NUREG-1022 and its Supplements 1 and 2.</textblock>
    <textblock>The purposes of this document are to ensure events are reported as required by improving the reporting guidelines related to 10 CFR 50.72 and 50.73 and to consolidate these guidelines into a single reference document.</textblock>
    <textblock>The NRC staff is seeking public comment before finalizing the revised NUREG because of the broad interest in event reporting at nuclear power plants. The staff requests that comments be limited to the same scope as the document, which involves clarifying but not changing the reporting requirements in §§50.72 and 50.73.</textblock>
