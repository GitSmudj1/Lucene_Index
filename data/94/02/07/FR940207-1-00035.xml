  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain de Havilland, Inc., Model DHC-8-100 and -300 series airplanes, that currently requires inspection to detect cracks of the upper drag strut trunnion fittings of the nose landing gear, inspection to verify tightness of the fitting attachment bolts, and replacement of the fittings or fasteners, if necessary. This action would require a terminating modification that would eliminate the need for repetitive inspections; and would limit the applicability of the rule. This proposal is prompted by the development of a modification that positively addresses the identified unsafe condition. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the upper drag strut trunnion fittings of the nose landing gear, which could lead to collapse of the nose landing gear.</textblock>
