    <textblock>Becoming an Intervenor</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition to involvement in the EA scoping process, you may want to become an official party to the proceeding or become an ``intervenor''. Among other things, intervenors have the right to receive copies of case-related Commission documents and filings by other intervenors. Likewise, each intervenor must provide copies of its filings to all other parties. If you want to become an intervenor you must file a Motion to Intervene according to Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.214) attached as appendix 2.</textblock>
    <textblock>The date for filing timely motions to intervene in this proceeding has passed. Therefore, parties now seeking to file late interventions must show good cause, as required by §385.214(b)(3), why this time limitation should be waived. Environmental issues have been viewed as good cause for late intervention. You do not need intervenor status to have your scoping comments considered.</textblock>
    <textblock>Additional Questions?</textblock>
    <textblock>Additional information about the proposed project is available from Mr. Steven G. Grape, EA Project Manager, at (202) 208-0812.</textblock>
