    <textblock>There are other replacement and addition activities in Western's O&amp;M budget documents which are not included in the Engineering Ten-Year Plan. These items are mostly communication equipment, including microwave equipment and remote terminal units. Each of these O&amp;M budget activities was compared to the most recent data and revised to reflect an overall reduction of $1.5 million in FY 1997. Western will continue to evaluate the implementation of the Engineering Ten-Year Plan and adequacy of the provisional P-DP rates and will include any changes in future rate adjustments.</textblock>
    <textblock>The capitalized costs for future replacements and additions in the cost evaluation period include IDC. The IDC calculation for each replacement is determined by the interest rate in the year construction begins. The annual interest expense for replacements and additions is also based on the interest rate in the year construction begins. The cumulative investment cost for replacements through the cost evaluation period is $115,859,859. The cumulative investment cost for additions through the cost evaluation period is $126,839,043.</textblock>
    <textblock>The replacement program is used to forecast replacements in years 1999-2047. The replacement program showed low replacement levels in some FYs and high levels in other years. Western believes that only a certain amount of work can be done in any given year. Therefore, Western decided to average the replacement numbers to reflect a stable level of replacements which could be supported over the long term.</textblock>
    <textblock>Purchased Power Expense</textblock>
    <textblock>The consultation and comment period was reopened due to the increase in purchased power expense for FY 1993. Data for purchased power were initially based on the FY 1993 congressionally approved budget. However, during FY 1993, current actual expenses for purchased power far exceed the original FY 1993 congressional budget estimate of $700,000. The current expenses for purchased power for FY 1993 are $5,000,000. This change in purchased power expense has led to an increase in the firm power rate. The increase in purchased power expense resulted from flooding conditions along the Colorado River in southwestern Arizona, which created a generation deficiency.</textblock>
