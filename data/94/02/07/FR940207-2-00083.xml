    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with the Privacy Act of 1974 (Privacy Act), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is establishing two new systems of records to be maintained and used by the Board's Office of the Inspector General. The two systems are called</textblock>
    <textblock>OIG Investigative Records</textblock>
    <textblock>(BGFRS/OIG-1) and</textblock>
    <textblock>OIG Personnel Records</textblock>
    <textblock>(BGFRS/OIG-2). Previously, information contained in the first system was maintained as part of the Board's personnel systems of records. The second system identified above includes the OIG's database management and work assignment and tracking system and contains personal and employment information on OIG personnel. Changes to that system have caused that system to be subject to the Privacy Act.</textblock>

    <textblock>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Board's Office of the Inspector General (OIG) performs its duties in accordance with the Inspector General Act of 1978, as amended by the Inspector General Act Amendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 95-452, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.) (IG Act). The OIG is an independent unit within the Board which was established to promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness in the administration of Board programs and operations and to detect and prevent fraud, waste and abuse in such programs and operations.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Board is establishing two new systems of records, pursuant to the Privacy Act, entitled: (1)</textblock>
    <textblock>OIG Investigative Records</textblock>
    <textblock>, and (2)</textblock>
    <textblock>OIG Personnel Records</textblock>
    <textblock>. These systems of records are essential for the Board's OIG to perform the duties assigned to that Office by the IG Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>The system called</textblock>
    <textblock>OIG Investigative Records</textblock>
    <textblock>(designated BGFRS/OIG-1 below) will consist of files and records compiled by the OIG on Board employees or other persons involved with the Board's programs or operations who have been or are under investigation for criminal or civil fraud and abuse related to the Board's programs or operations. The Board's Inspector General has the authority to conduct such an investigation under the IG Act. These files and records include materials maintained in electronic and hard copy form including databases for case tracking, ``Hotline'' telephone call logs, investigator notes, case files, and memoranda or letters.</textblock>
    <textblock>The system of records called</textblock>
    <textblock>OIG Personnel Records</textblock>
    <textblock>(designated BGFRS/OIG-2 below) will consist of files and records compiled by the OIG on past, current, and prospective employees of the OIG for use in the management of the Board's OIG. These files and records include materials maintained in electronic or hard copy form, several databases including the OIG Time Entry System, and files on individual employees maintained and used by the OIG. The information in the system of records is used for making and tracking assignments and for assessing individual employee progress on assignments as well as for evaluating employees.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Board proposes to exempt certain files within these two new systems of records from disclosure to individuals who are the subject of a record in the system. The exemptions would cover only files compiled for the following purposes:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Investigative material compiled for law enforcement purposes; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Investigatory material compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for employment by the OIG, but only to the extent the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the Board or OIG under an express promise of confidentiality.</textblock>
    <textblock>This information in these two new systems is proposed to be exempt under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(2) and (k)(5).</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2), the system of records designated as</textblock>
    <textblock>OIG Investigative Records</textblock>
    <textblock>(BGFRS/OIG-1) also shall be exempt from certain parts of the Privacy Act insofar as the records are maintained by a Board component which performs as its principal function any activity pertaining to the enforcement of criminal laws and which consists of:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Information compiled for the purpose of identifying individual criminal offenders and alleged offenders;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Information compiled for the purpose of a criminal investigation, including reports of informants and investigators, and associated with an identifiable individual; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Reports identifiable to an individual compiled at any stage of the process of enforcement of the criminal laws from arrest or indictment through release from supervision.</textblock>
    <textblock>The system is exempt from the provisions for the following reasons: notifying an individual at the individual's request of the existence of records in a criminal investigative file pertaining to such individual, or granting access to such an investigative file could:</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) Interfere with investigative and enforcement proceedings and with co-defendants' right to a fair trial;</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) Disclose the identity of confidential sources and reveal confidential information supplied by these sources;</textblock>
    <textblock>(C) Disclose investigative techniques and procedures; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(D) Be inconsistent with Federal laws and rules governing disclosure of such information in certain circumstances.</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), a report of these new systems of records is being filed with the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. These new systems of records will become effective on April 8, 1994, without further notice, unless the Board publishes a notice to the contrary in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, the Board proposes the establishment of the following system of records.</textblock>
    <textblock>BGFRS/OIG-1</textblock>
    <textblock>System name:</textblock>
    <textblock>OIG Investigative Records.</textblock>
    <textblock>System location:</textblock>
    <textblock>Office of Inspector General, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Suite 1070, 1850 K Street, NW., Washington, DC 20006.</textblock>
    <textblock>Categories of individuals covered by the system:</textblock>
    <textblock>Individuals covered consist of:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Officers or employees of the Board or other persons involved in the Board's programs or operations who are or have been under investigation by the Board's Office of Inspector General in order to determine whether such officers, employees or other persons have been or are engaging in fraud and abuse with respect to the Board's programs or operations; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Complainants and witnesses where necessary for future retrieval.</textblock>
    <textblock>Categories of records in the system:</textblock>
    <textblock>The system contains files on individual investigations including investigative reports and related documents generated during the course of or subsequent to an investigation. It includes electronic and hard copy case tracking systems, databases containing investigatory information, ``Hotline'' telephone logs, and investigator workpapers and memoranda and letter referrals to management or others.</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority for maintenance of the system:</textblock>
    <textblock>5 U.S.C. App. 4(a)(1) and 6(a)(2).</textblock>
    <textblock>Purpose(s):</textblock>
    <textblock>These records are collected, maintained and used by the OIG in its inquiries and investigations and reports relating to the administration of the Board's programs and operations and to manage the investigatory program.</textblock>
    <textblock>Routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categories of users and purposes of such uses:</textblock>
    <textblock>Under normal circumstances, no individually identifiable records will be provided. However, under those unusual circumstances when release of information contained in an individually identifiable record is required, proper safeguards will be maintained to protect the information collected from unwarranted invasion of personal privacy. Subject to this general limitation, the routine uses are as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. In the event the information in the system of records indicates a violation or potential violation of a criminal or civil law, rule, or regulation, the relevant records may be disclosed to the appropriate federal, state, or local agency or authority responsible for investigating or prosecuting such a violation or for enforcing or implementing a statute, rule, or regulation.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. The information in the system of records may be disclosed to a court, magistrate, or administrative tribunal in the course of presenting evidence, including disclosures to counsel or witnesses in the course of civil discovery, litigation, or settlement negotiations or in connection with criminal proceedings.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The information may be disclosed to a congressional office in response to an inquiry made by that office at the request of the individual who is the subject of the records.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. The information may be disclosed to any source, including a federal, state, or local agency maintaining civil, criminal, or other relevant enforcement information or other pertinent information, but only to the extent necessary for the OIG to obtain information relevant to an OIG investigation.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. The information maybe disclosed in order to respond to a federal agency's request made in connection with the hiring or retention of an individual, the issuance of a security clearance, the reporting of an investigation of an individual, the letting of a contract or issuance of a grant, license, or other benefit by the requesting agency, but only to the extent that the information disclosed is necessary and relevant to the requesting agency's decision on the matter.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. The information may be disclosed to other federal entities, such as other federal Offices of Inspector General or the General Accounting Office, or to a private party with which the OIG or the Board has contracted for the purpose of auditing or reviewing the performance or internal management of the OIG's investigatory program, provided the record will not be transferred in a form that is individually identifiable, and provided further that the entity acknowledges in writing that it is required to maintain Privacy Act safeguards for the information.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition to the foregoing routine uses, a record which is contained in this system and derived from another Board system of records may be disclosed as a routine use as specified in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>notice of the system of records from which the records derived.</textblock>
