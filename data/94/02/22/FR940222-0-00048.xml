    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>44 CFR part 403 currently imposes a shipping</textblock>
    <textblock>restriction prohibiting any ships documented under the laws of the United States or any aircraft</textblock>
    <textblock>registered under the laws of the United States from</textblock>
    <textblock>transporting goods or traveling to North Korea and Vietnam.</textblock>
    <textblock>On February 3, 1994, President Clinton signed a memorandum</textblock>
    <textblock>directing the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Treasury, and the Secretary of Commerce</textblock>
    <textblock>to lift the embargo against Vietnam.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to the President's memorandum, the Departments</textblock>
    <textblock>of Commerce and Transportation are revising their</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations to reflect this change in policy, effective at the time of the President's announcement. 44 CFR</textblock>
    <textblock>part 403 is being revised to remove all references to</textblock>
    <textblock>Vietnam.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to the foreign affairs exception in title 5</textblock>
    <textblock>U.S.C. 553(a)(1), this rulemaking is exempt from the</textblock>
    <textblock>Administrative Procedure Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with the Paperwork</textblock>
    <textblock>Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511), there are no</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements for information collection associated with</textblock>
    <textblock>this final rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>National Environmental Policy Act</textblock>
    <textblock>DOT has also analyzed</textblock>
    <textblock>this final rule under the National Environmental Policy Act and</textblock>
    <textblock>determined that it will not have a significant impact on</textblock>
    <textblock>the human environment.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12612 (Federalism)</textblock>
    <textblock>Finally, DOT has</textblock>
    <textblock>analyzed this rule in accordance with the principles and</textblock>
    <textblock>criteria contained in E.O. 12612, and has determined that this rule</textblock>
    <textblock>will not have sufficient federalism implications to</textblock>
    <textblock>warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</textblock>
