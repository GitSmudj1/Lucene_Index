    <textblock>The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires the NCUA to prepare an analysis to describe any significant economic impact any regulation may have on a potential number of small credit unions (primarily those under $1 million in assets). Preliminary analysis concerning the effect the proposed rule will have on small credit unions indicates that no significant economic impact will result if the rule is promulgated in final form by the NCUA Board. The proposed rule simply repeats the preexisting requirements of federal credit unions to pay operating fees and federally insured credit unions to pay one percent deposit and insurance premiums with the only modification being the dates when these fees and premiums must be paid. Therefore, the NCUA Board has determined and certifies under the authority granted in 5 U.S.C. 605(b) that the proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small credit unions. Accordingly, the NCUA Board has determined that a Regulatory Flexibility Analysis is not required.</textblock>
    <textblock>Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>These amendments have no effect on paperwork requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12612</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. The proposed regulation dealing with insurance premiums applies to all federally insured credit unions. However, it makes no substantive changes except to change the dates for certain filings and assessments of fees. The NCUA Board has determined that this amendment is not likely to have any direct effect on states, on the relationship between the states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government because federally insured credit unions are currently required to pay an insurance premium.</textblock>
