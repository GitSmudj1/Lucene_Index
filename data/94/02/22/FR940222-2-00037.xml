    <textblock>In the Second Report and Order, CC Docket No. 91-213 (released 1/31/94), the Commission modified certain features of the price cap regulatory system applicable to local exchange carriers (LECs) to accommodate the recent restructure of the LECs local transport rates. Transport services, including all the transmission-related elements, the tandem switching charge, and the interconnection charge, were moved out of the price cap basket for traffic sensitive services and placed into a combined ``trunking'' basket containing transport and special access services. The Commission realigned the service categories and subcategories within the trunking basket to reflect the similarities between certain special access and flat-related transport services, and to accommodate the new density zone pricing system that were adopted for both special access and transport. The pricing bands applicable to the service categories and subcategories were also adapted. All LECs subject to the price cap rules are required to file a supplemental tariff review plan to recalculate their price cap indexes pursuant to the decision in the Order. The recalculated indexes should be used as the basis of any price cap filing that changes rates of services in the trunking or traffic sensitive baskets subsequent to the effective date of the initial restructured transport tariffs. Subsequent tariff filings must be made pursuant to the modified rules. The information will be used to aid in the review of the LECs' transport service restructure by the Commission and interested parties.</textblock>
