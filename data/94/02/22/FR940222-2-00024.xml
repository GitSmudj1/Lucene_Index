    <textblock>Take notice that on February 9, 1994, Southern Natural Gas Company (Southern) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Seventh Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets to be effective February 1, 1994:</textblock>
    <textblock>First Revised Sheet No. 136</textblock>
    <textblock>First Revised Sheet No. 138</textblock>
    <textblock>Southern states that the purpose of this filing is to change its delivery point allocation methodology in its transportation tariff to allow it to reallocate the volumes of gas delivered for a shipper under its firm and interruptible agreements to maximize the allocation to the shipper's firm agreement for billing purposes. A change has also been proposed that will allow the allocation of no-notice volumes to a shipper's two-part FT-NN agreement prior to allocating the no-notice volumes to the same shipper's one-part FT-NN agreement.</textblock>
    <textblock>Southern has requested all waivers necessary to make these sheets effective February 1, 1994; provided, however, that if Southern does not receive an order by March 1, 1994, approving these revisions, it has requested that the Commission approve the revised tariff sheets to be effective March 1, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Southern states that copies of the filing will be served upon its shippers and interested state commissions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR Sections 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions and protests should be filed on or before February 23, 1994. Protests will not be considered by the Commission in determining the parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.</textblock>
