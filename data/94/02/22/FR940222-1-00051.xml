    <textblock>As provided in §417.494(b)(1)(v), HCFA may terminate its Medicare contact with an HMO or CMP that has a final overclaim for 2 consecutive years, on the grounds that the HMO or CMP is inefficient and that it is not prudent for HCFA to contract with inefficient entities.</textblock>

    <textblock>(2) HCFA adjusts the interim per capita rate as necessary during the contract period and makes final adjustments at the end of the contract period.</textblock>
