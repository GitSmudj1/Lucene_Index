    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>Damages resulting from the heavy rainfalls and related flooding of 1993 in the Upper Mississippi and Lower Missouri River basins were some of the most devastating in the history of the Nation. The magnitude of these floods has raised serious concerns about this country's ability to provide adequate flood protection and to respond quickly and effectively during post-flood recovery. Perhaps most significantly, it has forced the Nation to reconsider its best long-term strategy, not only to prevent a recurrence of the 1993 experience, but to ensure that floodplains and related watersheds function to the fullest extent possible in ways that achieve environmental, economic, and socio-cultural objectives.</textblock>
    <textblock>In response to the Flood of 1993, an Interagency Floodplain Management Review Committee was formed by the Administration to examine what happened and why, to solicit opinions, and to make recommendation as to what changes in current policies would most effectively achieve the goals of floodplain management; this Review Committee is part of the Administration's larger Floodplain Management Task Force. A final report of this Review Committee will include: a description of the flood event, including quantitative assessments of the damages incurred; an assessment of the performance of Federal flood control measures; a summary of the concerns of affected parties as expressed during the public input phase of this study; the identification of attributes which could be used to identify areas where alternative flood, floodplain, and watershed management measures might be taken to yield the highest overall socio-cultural, economic, and environmental payoff; proposals for administrative or legislative change which would enhance the flexibility and effectiveness of floodplain and watershed management; and a framework to focus and guide development of comprehensive answers for improved floodplain and watershed management by describing questions that remain to be addressed and identifying data and resource needs.</textblock>
    <textblock>As part of the Review Committee's outreach efforts, interested parties are invited to submit comments and recommendations related to floodplain and watershed management policies and programs.</textblock>
