    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Introduction</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the Medicare program (title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act)), HCFA helps pay for health services furnished to eligible beneficiaries. Under ``part A'' (Hospital Insurance), HCFA pays hospitals and other providers of services for inpatient hospital services, and some skilled nursing facility services, home health care, and hospice care. Under ``part B'' (Supplementary Medical Insurance), HCFA helps pay for physicians' services, as well as hospital outpatient and certain other medical services.</textblock>
    <textblock>In general, HCFA pays for Medicare part A and part B services under a fee-for-service system that includes a variety of payment methods such as_</textblock>
    <textblock>•Fee schedules for physician and laboratory services and durable medical equipment;</textblock>
    <textblock>•Diagnosis-related groups for most hospital services under the prospective payment system (PPS);</textblock>
    <textblock>•Reasonable costs for skilled nursing care, home health services and the services of certain hospitals not subject to the PPS; and</textblock>
    <textblock>•Reasonable charges for some supplier services.</textblock>
    <textblock>For part A services, HCFA usually pays the provider and, for part B services, the supplier who has accepted assignment or, if assignment has not been made, the beneficiary. Payment is on the basis of claims submitted by the provider, supplier, or beneficiary after the service has been furnished.</textblock>
    <textblock>Title XVIII of the Act also permits beneficiaries to enroll in, and receive their Medicare benefits through, prepaid health care organizations. These include health maintenance organizations (HMOs), and competitive medical plans (CMPs), with contracts under section 1876 of the Act, and health care prepayment plans (HCPPs) with agreements under section 1833 of the Act. HMOs and CMPs are required to furnish the full range of Medicare benefits, and do not bill on a fee-for-service basis for covered services furnished to their Medicare enrollees. Rather, HCFA pays the organization in advance a monthly amount for each enrolled beneficiary. If the HMO or CMP contracts to be paid on a reasonable cost basis, there is a cost reconciliation at the end of the year. HCFA also pays HCPPs on a reasonable cost basis, following procedures similar to those used for HMOs and CMPs, but only for part B services. If an HCPP arranges for part A services for its enrollees, the Medicare intermediary pays the provider for these services on a fee-for-service basis.</textblock>
    <textblock>As of March 1993, about 2.4 million of the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries had chosen to enroll in an HMO, CMP, or HCPP.</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule would impose presumptive limits on reasonable costs_</textblock>
    <textblock>•For HMOs and CMPs that choose to contract with HCFA on a reasonable cost basis; and</textblock>
    <textblock>•For HCPPs that furnish (to Medicare enrollees) services in general acute-care hospitals.</textblock>
    <textblock>These presumptive limits replace absolute limits that were promulgated in 1985 but were never put into effect for reasons given in HCFA Ruling No. 89-2, and explained below under section II.B.2. This rule would establish bases for exceptions to the presumptive limit and would also establish limits on reasonable costs for HCPPs that do not furnish inpatient hospital services.</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>A. HMOs, CMPs, and HCPPs</textblock>
    <textblock>1. HMOs and CMPs</textblock>
    <textblock>Under section 1876 of the Act we are authorized to contract with HMOs and CMPs to pay them either on a risk basis or on a cost basis for services they furnish to Medicare enrollees. HMOs and CMPs must provide all part A and part B services to Medicare enrollees entitled to both part A and part B, but HCPPs may limit the services they provide. Risk HMOs and CMPs receive monthly capitation payments equivalent to 95 percent of the adjusted average per capita cost (AAPCC).</textblock>
