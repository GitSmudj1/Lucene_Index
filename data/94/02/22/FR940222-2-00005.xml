    <textblock>Decision:</textblock>
    <textblock>Approved. No instrument of equivalent scientific value to the foreign instruments described below, for such purposes as each is intended to be used, is being manufactured in the United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>Docket Number:</textblock>
    <textblock>93-003R.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicant:</textblock>
    <textblock>University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720.</textblock>
    <textblock>Instrument:</textblock>
    <textblock>Blackbody Furnace with Internationally Accredited Absolute Reference.</textblock>
    <textblock>Manufacturer:</textblock>
    <textblock>National Physical Laboratory, United Kingdom.</textblock>
    <textblock>Intended Use:</textblock>
    <textblock>See notice at 58 FR 14559, March 18, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>Reasons:</textblock>
    <textblock>The foreign instrument provides: (1) highly flat spectral emissivity over the 3-30 Î¼m range, (2) an isothermal emissivity to 0.999, (3) characterization relative to an absolute standard cavity and (4) operability in an airborne observatory.</textblock>
