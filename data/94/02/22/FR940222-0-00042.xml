    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>At the request of the North Coast Railroad, the Coast Guard is amending the regulation for the North Coast Railroad Bridge crossing Eureka Slough, mile 0.3 at Eureka. The existing regulation requires 24 hour advance notice for openings. The amended regulation stipulates that the draw need not open for the passage of vessels, however the draw must be restored to full operation within six months of notification to take such action from the District Commander. This amendment will relieve the bridge owner of the burden of maintaining the machinery and of having a person available to open the draw, and will still provide for the reasonable needs of navigation.</textblock>

    <textblock>Drafting Information</textblock>
    <textblock>The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Jerry P. Olmes, Project Manager, and Lieutenant Robin Barber, Project Attorney.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory History</textblock>
    <textblock>In 58 FR 7497, Feb. 8, 1993, the Coast Guard published a notice of proposed rulemaking to amend the regulation that the draw no longer need open for the passage of vessels. In addition, the Commander, Eleventh Coast Guard District also published the proposal in a Public Notice dated February 16, 1993. Six comments were received on the proposal. A public hearing was not requested and one was not held.</textblock>
    <textblock>Background and Purpose</textblock>
    <textblock>Presently, the North Coast Railroad Bridge is required to open on signal if at least 24 hours advance notice is given. The North Coast Railroad had requested that the draw no longer need open for vessels since there had been no requests for opening for at least eight years. Except for tests, Coast Guard bridge records show no bridge openings for at least thirty-six years.</textblock>
    <textblock>Discussion of Comments and Changes</textblock>
    <textblock>The Coast Guard received 6 comments on the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Four offered no objection. The California Department of Boating and Waterways (CalBoating) requested that the Coast Guard reevaluate the need for persons to be available to operate the bridge if boating activities increase. The Humboldt County Association of Governments (HCAOG) objected to the original proposal, as they felt that permanent closure was too final an action to take. Even though no vessel had requested an opening for many years, the HCAOG's Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) felt that the bridge should remain functional, and suggested possibly a 30 day window for notice of opening. The TAC advised that many business and properties upstream of the bridge had dikes which were in some disrepair, that fuel spills or hazardous material in the slough could be inapproachable should the bridge be closed on a permanent basis, and that bridge closure could impact future economic development along reaches of the Eureka Slough by eliminating waterfront access.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Coast Guard found that dike and levee maintenance is presently done by dragline instead of dredges and that pollution response would likely be done from landside as well. The bridge would not prevent small motorboats from reaching sites upstream of the bridge to transport pollution containment booms or investigate spills. The regulation would prevent larger vessels from travelling upstream or mooring upstream. The CalBoating and HCAOG comments prompted the Coast Guard to develop a compromise proposal that the bridge need not open for vessels, but in the event of development requiring bridge openings, the bridge would be restored to service in six months upon order of the District Commander. On September 22, 1993, the HCAOG agreed to the compromise, and on January 6, 1994, the North Coast Railroad also agreed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory Evaluation</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule is not considered a significant regulatory action under Executive Order 12866 and is not significant under the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11040, February 26, 1979). The Coast Guard expects the economic impact of this rule to be so minimal that a Regulatory Evaluation is unnecessary.</textblock>
    <textblock>Small Entities</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>), the Coast Guard must consider whether this rule will have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated small businesses that are not dominant in their field and that otherwise qualify as `'small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632). Because it expects the impacts of this change to be minimal, the Coast Guard certifies under section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>) that this rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>Collection of Information</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule contains no collection of information requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>).</textblock>
    <textblock>Federalism</textblock>
    <textblock>The Coast Guard has analyzed this proposal under the principles and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612 and has determined that this rule does not raise sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</textblock>
    <textblock>Environment</textblock>
    <textblock>The Coast Guard considered the environmental impact of this rule and concluded that, under section 2.B.2.g.(5) of Commandant Instruction M16475.1B, promulgation of operating requirements or procedures for drawbridges is categorically excluded from further environmental documentation. A Categorical Exclusion Determination is available in the docket.</textblock>
