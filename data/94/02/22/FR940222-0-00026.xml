    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA is amending the antibiotic drug regulations by updating, making noncontroversial technical changes, and making corrections in certain antibiotic drug regulations that provide for accepted standards of antibiotic and antibiotic-containing drugs intended for human use.</textblock>
    <textblock>In ยง442.216a(a)(1) (21 CFR 442.216a(a)(1)), separate limits for the pyridine content are being given for the</textblock>
    <textblock>L</textblock>
    <textblock>-arginine formulation and the sodium carbonate formulation. Separate limits are needed because the current limits allow the</textblock>
    <textblock>L</textblock>
    <textblock>-arginine formulation to contain up to 5.2 milligrams (mg) of pyridine per gram (g) of ceftazidime activity, while the sodium carbonate formulation may not contain more than 4.4 mg of pyridine per g of ceftazidime activity.</textblock>
    <textblock>In ยง442.216a(b)(1)(ii)(</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>), different loss on drying procedures are given for the</textblock>
    <textblock>L</textblock>
    <textblock>-arginine formulation and the sodium carbonate formulation. This is necessary because the procedure in the current monograph would not remove all of the water from the sodium carbonate formulation of the product (some water is ``trapped'' as sodium hydrogen carbonate), and the procedure will thus lead to falsely high potency values. Because the two formulations contain differing amounts of ceftazidime pentahydrate as a percent weight by weight of the powder blend, different loss on drying limits are now being given for each formulation. The loss on drying limits are now not more than 12.5 percent if it contains</textblock>
    <textblock>L</textblock>
    <textblock>-arginine and not more than 13.5 percent if it contains sodium carbonate. The asymmetry of the arginine peak is also revised from the current limit of 2.5 to a limit of 4.0. This limit is more realistic of the values obtained in this assay.</textblock>
    <textblock>Revisions are being made in the descriptions of certain ophthalmic products (21 CFR part 444) and peptide products (21 CFR part 448). FDA has discovered that some of these monographs contain errors that would allow formulation without preservatives and other essential inactive ingredients to fit the monographs. FDA has not reviewed any of these products without these ingredients and does not know if they are safe and effective. The agency is, therefore, revising certain ophthalmic monographs to correct these errors.</textblock>
    <textblock>In ยง455.185a(a)(1) (21 CFR 455.185a(a)(1)), FDA is making a revision to allow vancomycin hydrochloride for oral solution to contain a suitable stabilizing agent. The agency has reviewed this formulation and found it to be safe and effective.</textblock>
    <textblock>Environmental Impact</textblock>
    <textblock>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.</textblock>
    <textblock>Submitting Comments and Filing Objections</textblock>
    <textblock>These amendments institute changes that are corrective, editorial, or of a minor technical nature. Because the amendments are not controversial, and because when effective they provide notice of accepted standards, FDA finds that notice, public procedure, and delayed effective date are unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, becomes effective February 22, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before March 24, 1994, submit written comments to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before March 24, 1994, a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before April 25, 1994, the data, information, and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information, and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.</textblock>
    <textblock>The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained in 21 CFR 314.300.</textblock>
    <textblock>All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C. 331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.</textblock>

    <textblock>1. The authority citation for 21 CFR part 442 continues to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>Sec. 507 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357).</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 442.216a is amended by revising paragraphs (a)(1), (b)(1)(ii)(</textblock>

    <textblock>. Ceftazidime pentahydrate for injection is a dry mixture of ceftazidime pentahydrate and sodium carbonate or</textblock>
    <textblock>L</textblock>
    <textblock>-arginine. Its ceftazidime potency is satisfactory if each milligram of ceftazidime pentahydrate for injection contains not less than 900 micrograms and not more than 1,050 micrograms of cefazidime activity when corrected for both loss on drying and its sodium carbonate or</textblock>
    <textblock>L</textblock>
    <textblock>-arginine content, as appropriate for the formulation. Its ceftazidime content is satisfactory if it is not less than 90 percent and not more than 120 percent of the number of milligrams of ceftazidime that it is represented to contain. It is sterile. It is nonpyrogenic. Its loss on drying is not more than 12.5 percent if it contains</textblock>
    <textblock>L</textblock>
    <textblock>-arginine and not more than 13.5 percent if it contains sodium carbonate. The pH of its aqueous solution is not less than 5.0 and not more than 7.5. Its pyridine content, if it contains sodium carbonate, is not more than 0.4 percent, except that for the issuance of a certificate for each batch of the sodium carbonate formulation, the pyridine content is not more than 0.12 percent. Its pyridine content, if it contains</textblock>
    <textblock>L</textblock>
    <textblock>-arginine, is not more than 0.3 percent, except that for the issuance of a certificate, the pyridine content of the</textblock>
    <textblock>L-</textblock>
    <textblock>arginine formulation is not more than 0.10 percent. The ceftazidime pentahydrate conforms to the standard prescribed by ยง442.16a(a)(1).</textblock>
