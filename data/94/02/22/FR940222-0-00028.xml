  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule revises the exclusions and limitations of the CHAMPUS regulation pertaining to preventive care and unnecessary diagnostic tests not related to a specific illness, injury, or definitive set of symptoms, to allow coverage for screening mammography and PAP tests on a preventive basis initially following the recommended guidelines of the American Cancer Society as a basis for coverage. The final rule also removes the requirement for physician supervision and referral for certified marriage and family therapists; requires all certified marriage and family therapists to accept CHAMPUS payment as payment in full; ensures that the relationship of certified marriage and family therapists is consistent with other mental health practitioners with comparable education and training; protects the CHAMPUS beneficiary from incurring added out-of-pocket costs for care rendered that is not part of the current CHAMPUS mental health benefits package; and better defines the specific requirements of existing CHAMPUS policies for coverage and reimbursement of services of teaching physicians and physicians in training.</textblock>
