    <textblock>To prevent fracture of the engine rear mount struts, and subsequent reduced structural integrity of the nacelle and engine support structure, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Within 50 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, perform a detailed visual inspection to detect breakage in the engine strut assemblies, part number 8711016-001, -003, -005, or -007, in accordance with De Havilland, Inc., Service Bulletin S.B. 8-71-17, dated April 3, 1992.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) If any broken strut is detected, prior to further flight, replace the broken strut with a new strut, part number 87110016-009, or a reworked strut, part number 8DK1763-001; Post-Modification 8/1763; in accordance with the service bulletin.</textblock>

    <textblock>(2) If no broken strut is detected, repeat the inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 50 flight hours.</textblock>

    <textblock>(d) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, New York Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), FAA, Engine and Propeller Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, New York ACO.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note 2:</textblock>
    <textblock>Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the New York ACO.</textblock>
