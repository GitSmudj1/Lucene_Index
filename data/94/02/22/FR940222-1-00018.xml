    <textblock>(6) For purposes of this paragraph (d), a person is a ``principal'' if he or she is the legal or beneficial owner of at least 20 percent of both the passive business and the small business concern to which the passive business intends to lease real or personal property. If the passive business exists in the form of a trust, the trust's grantor or trustee would be a ``principal'' if he or she owns at least 20 percent of the small business concern, and a beneficiary of at least 20 percent of the trust's assets would be a ``principal'' if he or she owns at least 20 percent of the small business concern. If members of the same family (father, mother, son, daughter, wife, husband, brother or sister) meet the 20 percent ownership requirement in both the passive business and the small business concern they would be considered to be the same ``principal'' for SBA purposes.</textblock>
