    <textblock>Notice of Vote to Amend Agenda</textblock>
    <textblock>At the February 7, 1994, meeting of the Board of Governors, noticed in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on January 28, 1994, (59 FR 4138) the members voted unanimously to add to the agenda consideration of a contract for consulting services for the design of an EVA program for the Postal Service and that no earlier public announcement of the new item on the agenda was possible. The Governors were of the opinion that public access to the discussion would likely disclose information, the premature disclosure of which could significantly frustrate possible future actions by the Postal Service.</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, the members unanimously determined that, pursuant to section 552b(c)(9)(B) of title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(i) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations, discussion of the matter was properly closed to public observation.</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with section 552b(f)(1) of title 5, United States Code, and section 7.6(a) of title 39 Code of Federal regulations, the General Counsel of the Postal Service has certified that in her opinion the meeting may properly be closed to public observation pursuant to section 552b(c)(9)(B) of title 5, United States Code, and section 7.3(i) of title 39, Code of Federal Regulations.</textblock>
