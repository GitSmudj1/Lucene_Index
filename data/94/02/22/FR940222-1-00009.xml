    <textblock>For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board is proposing to amend 12 CFR part 208 as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 208_MEMBERSHIP OF STATE BANKING INSTITUTIONS IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM (REGULATION H)</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 208 continues to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>12 U.S.C. 36, 248(a), 248(c), 321-338, 461, 481-486, 601, and 611, 1814 and 1823(j); 3105; 3310 and 3331-3351, 3906-3909; 15 U.S.C. 78b, 78l(b), 78l(g), 78l(i), 78o-4(c) (5), 78q, 78q-1, and 78w.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Appendix A to part 208 is amended by revising the fifth and sixth paragraphs under ``</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Overview</textblock>
    <textblock>'' to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix A to Part 208_Capital Adequacy Guidelines for State Member Banks: Risk-Based Measure</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Overview</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>The risk-based capital ratio focuses principally on broad categories of credit risk, although the framework for assigning assets and off-balance-sheet items to risk categories does incorporate elements of transfer risk, as well as limited instances of interest rate and market risk. The framework incorporates risks arising from traditional banking activities as well as risks arising from nontraditional activities. The risk-based ratio does not, however, incorporate other factors that can affect an institution's financial condition. These factors include overall interest-rate exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks; the quality and level of earnings; investment, loan portfolio, and other concentrations of credit risk; certain risks arising from nontraditional activities; the quality of loans and investments; the effectiveness of loan and investment policies; and management's overall ability to monitor and control financial and operating risks, including the risks presented by concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition to evaluating capital ratios, an overall assessment of capital adequacy must take account of those factors, including, in particular, the level and severity of problem and classified assets. For this reason, the final supervisory judgement on a bank's capital adequacy may differ significantly from conclusions that might be drawn solely from the level of its risk-based capital ratio.</textblock>
