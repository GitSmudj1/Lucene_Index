    <textblock>Title:</textblock>
    <textblock>Requirements for the use of 1080 Collars for Livestock Protection (EPA ICR No. 1249.04; OMB No. 2070-0074). This is a request for extension of the expiration date of a currently approved collection.</textblock>
    <textblock>Abstract:</textblock>
    <textblock>Sodium monoflouroacetate (Compound 1080), a previously banned pesticide, was re-approved for use in a new delivery mechanism, the toxic collar. The EPA requires certified applicators, States, and registrants to monitor the use and effectiveness of the collar. The respondents are required to submit to the EPA an annual report containing the monitoring data. In addition, certified applicators must report to the States or the EPA all incidents of accidental poisoning of humans and domestic animals, as well as non-target species, and they must keep records of any hazards caused by the collar. The Agency uses these data to monitor the use of the collar, and to ensure the safety of livestock.</textblock>

    <textblock>The burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 37.1 hours per response for reporting, and 2.9 hours per recordkeeper annually. This estimate includes the time needed to review instructions, gather the data needed, and review the collection of information.</textblock>
