    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Title 44, U.S. Code, Chapter 35), this notice announces a proposed unchanged extension to a form which collects information from the public. OPM Form 1593, Survey of Federal Applicants and Recently Hired Employees, is used to collect quality indicator data from Federal applicants and recently hired employees. The form is part of a series of studies to assess and monitor the quality of the Federal workforce that has been implemented by the Office of Personnel Research and Development to improve the quality and image of the Federal service through more effective recruitment, retention, performance evaluation, and compensation practices. Approximately 75,000 Federal applicants and recently hired employees are expected to complete the questionnaire form and the form takes approximately 15 minutes to complete, for a total public burden of 18,750 hours. For copies of this proposal, call C. Ronald Trueworthy on (703) 908-8550.</textblock>
