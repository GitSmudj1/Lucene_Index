    <textblock>The drug export provisions in section 802 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 382) provide that FDA may approve applications for the export of human biological products that are not currently approved in the United States. Section 802(b)(3)(B) of the act sets forth the requirements that must be met in an application for approval. Section 802(b)(3)(C) of the act requires that the agency review the application within 30 days of its filing to determine whether the requirements of section 802(b)(3)(B) have been satisfied. Section 802(b)(3)(A) of the act requires that the agency publish a notice in the Federal Register within 10 days of the filing of an application for export to facilitate public participation in its review of the application. To meet this requirement, the agency is providing notice that American Cyanamide Co., Lederle-Praxis Biologicals Division, 401 North Middletown Rd., Pearl River, NY 10965, has filed an application requesting approval for the export of the human biological product Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed to the Federal Republic of Germany. The Acellular Pertussis Vaccine Adsorbed is for active immunization against pertussis (whooping cough) in children from 15 months to 6 years of age. The application was received and filed in the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research on January 24, 1994, which shall be considered the filing date for purposes of the act.</textblock>
