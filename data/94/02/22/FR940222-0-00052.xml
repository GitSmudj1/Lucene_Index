    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission, at the request of Sound of Life, Inc., allots Channel 287A to Grand Gorge, New York, as the community's first local aural transmission service. See 58 FR 41680, August 5, 1993. Channel 287A can be allotted to Grand Gorge in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements with a site restriction of 11.2 kilometers (6.9 miles) northeast, at coordinates North Latitude 42-26-39 and West Longitude 74-24-54, to avoid a short-spacing to Station WYCY, Channel 287A, Hawley, Pennsylvania. Canadian concurrence has been received since Grand Gorge is located within 320 kilometers (200 miles) of the U.S.-Canadian border. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.</textblock>
