    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission, at the request of Yvonne L. Baum-Olson (RM-8351), allots Channel 285C3 at Balsam Lake, Wisconsin. Channel 285C3 can be allotted to Balsam Lake in compliance with the Commission's minimum distance separation requirements with a site restriction of 14.7 kilometers (9.1 miles) east in order to avoid a short-spacing with Station KCLD-FM, Channel 284A, St. Cloud, Minnesota. The coordinates for Channel 285C3 at Balsam Lake are 45-26-05 and 92-16-02. The proposal filed by Jay Lellman (RM-7214), requesting the allotment of Channel 285A at Menomonie, Wisconsin, is dismissed. See 58 FR 40401, July 28, 1993. With this action, this proceeding is terminated.</textblock>
