    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This amendment supersedes Airworthiness Directive (AD) 91-08-09, which currently requires the following on certain Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation (Twin Commander) 500, 680, 681, 685, and 690 series airplanes: Repetitively inspecting the wing front spar lower cap (spar cap) for corrosion; and replacing the spar cap if corrosion exceeds certain limits. This action incorporates updated and more detailed inspection procedures, extends the repetitive inspection intervals, and provides the option of incorporating one of three modifications as terminating action for the repetitive inspections. The actions specified by the AD are intended to prevent wing structural damage that, if not detected, could progress to the point of failure.</textblock>

    <textblock>DATES:</textblock>
    <textblock>Effective April 12, 1994. The incorporation by reference of Twin Commander Service Bulletin No. 208A, dated November 9, 1992, is approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of April 12, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>The incorporation by reference of the instructions to Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK-144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992; and Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK-145, dated August 21, 1992, was previously approved by the Director of the Federal Register as of April 11, 1994.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>A proposal to amend part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations to include an AD that applies to certain Twin Commander Models 685, 690, 690A, and 690B airplanes was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on June 30, 1993 (58 FR 34952). The proposed AD would supersede AD 91-08-09 with a new AD that would (1) retain the requirement of repetitively inspecting the spar cap, and replacing the spar cap if certain corrosion limits are exceeded; (2) incorporate Twin Commander SB No. 208A, dated November 9, 1992; and (3) incorporate spar cap replacement procedures specified in Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK-144, Revision A, dated November 12, 1992; Twin Commander Custom Kit No. CK-145, dated August 21, 1992; and AVIADESIGN, Inc. Supplemental Type Certificate (STC), dated July 16, 1992.</textblock>
    <textblock>Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate in the making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the 10 comments received.</textblock>
    <textblock>Seven commenters concur with the proposal as written.</textblock>
    <textblock>Twin Commander states that the proposal should be changed to reflect that Custom Kit-145, which specifies procedures for replacing the spar cap for certain airplanes, also affects Models 680W and 681. The FAA concurs and has added these models to paragraph (b)(2) of the proposal, and has deleted paragraph (b)(4).</textblock>
    <textblock>Another commenter, the Civil Aviation Authority of Australia (CAA), recommends replacing the wing spar cap before the next 500 hours time-in-service (TIS) if corrosion is found, instead of treating any corrosion found. The CAA states that, if a corroded spar is not replaced, then the small fatigue crack formed as a result of the corrosion will grow to weaken the spar to a level below its design strength. The FAA is currently conducting a study to determine the fatigue crack growth rates from irregular corroded surfaces. Part of this study includes the consideration of a replacement time period for spar caps found corroded. When this study is complete, the FAA will consider taking further AD action to cover this issue. The proposed AD is unchanged as a result of this comment.</textblock>
