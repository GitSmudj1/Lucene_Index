    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Coast Guard proposes to change regulations governing the operation of the State Road 402, Max Brewer bridge, at mile 878.9, at Titusville, Florida, by permitting the draw to remain closed during different periods. This proposal is being made to synchronize the existing closed periods with the periods of peak vehicular traffic. This action should accommodate the needs of vehicular traffic, while still providing for the reasonable needs of navigation.</textblock>

    <textblock>Drafting Information</textblock>
    <textblock>The principal persons involved in drafting this document are Walter Paskowsky, Project Manager, and LT J.M. Losego, Project Counsel.</textblock>
    <textblock>Background and Purpose</textblock>
    <textblock>This bridge presently opens on signal except that from 6:15 a.m. to 7:15 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except federal holidays, the draw need not open. NASA, whose employees commute to and from the John F. Kennedy Space Center across the bridge, requested a 30 minute increase in the morning closed period extending from 6 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. This change was requested to ensure continuous uninterrupted flow of highway traffic during the heaviest daily commuter traffic periods. The bridgeowner, Brevard County, concurred with this proposal.</textblock>
