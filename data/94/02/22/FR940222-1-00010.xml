    <textblock>Bank deposit insurance, Banks, Banking, Capital adequacy, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Savings associations, State nonmember banks.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation hereby proposes to amend part 325 of title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 325_CAPITAL MAINTENANCE</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 325 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>12 U.S.C. 1815(a), 1815(b), 1816, 1818(a), 1818(b), 1818(c), 1818(t), 1819(Tenth), 1828(c), 1828(d), 1828(i), 1828(n), 1828(o), 1831o, 3907, 3909; Pub. L. 102-233, 105 Stat. 1761, 1790 (12 U.S.C. 1831n note); Pub. L. 102-242, 105 Stat. 2236, 2386 (12 U.S.C. 1828 note).</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง325.3</textblock>
    <textblock>[Amended]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 325.3(a) is amended in the fourth sentence by adding ``significant risks from concentrations of credit or nontraditional activities,'' immediately after ``funding risks,'' and by adding ``will take these other factors into account in analyzing the bank's capital adequacy and'' immediately after the third time ``FDIC'' appears in the section.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The fifth paragraph of the undesignated text of appendix A to part 325 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix A to Part 325_Statement of Policy on Risk-Based Capital</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>The risk-based capital ratio focuses principally on broad categories of credit risk; however, the ratio does not take account of many other factors that can affect a bank's financial condition. These factors include overall interest rate risk exposure; liquidity, funding and market risks; the quality and level of earnings; investment, loan portfolio, and other concentrations of credit risk; certain risks arising from nontraditional activities; the quality of loans and investments; the effectiveness of loan and investment policies; and management's overall ability to monitor and control financial and operating risks, including the risk presented by concentrations of credit and nontraditional activities. In addition to evaluating capital ratios, an overall assessment of capital adequacy must take account of each of these other factors, including, in particular, the level and severity of problem and adversely classified assets. For this reason, the final supervisory judgement on a bank's capital adequacy may differ significantly from the conclusions that might be drawn solely from the absolute level of the bank's risk-based capital ratio.</textblock>
