    <textblock>Title:</textblock>
    <textblock>Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs): Manufacturing, Processing, and Distribution in Commerce Exemptions. (EPA ICR No.: 0857.06; OMB No.: 2070-0021). This is a request for extension of the expiration date of a currently approved collection.</textblock>
    <textblock>Abstract:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) prohibits the manufacture of PCBs, or their processing or distribution in commerce. However, the statute sets conditions under which EPA may grant exemptions to this prohibition. Companies wishing to obtain the exemption must petition EPA by submitting certain information to the Agency. The information includes name and address of the petitioner, and amount and use of PCBs the petitioner wishes to manufacture, process, or distribute in commerce. The petitioner must provide evidence that the use of PCBs will not result in an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment. The petitioner must also provide evidence that demonstrates good faith efforts to develop a chemical substitute for PCBs which does not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environment.</textblock>
    <textblock>To renew an existing exemption, a petitioner must submit to the Agency a letter stating that there are no changes in the original petition for exemption. The letter must be submitted at least six months prior to the date the existing exemption expires, it must be signed by a designated official, and it must be sent to the EPA by certified mail.</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA uses the information to determine whether petitioners have met the exemption requirements prescribed by TSCA.</textblock>
