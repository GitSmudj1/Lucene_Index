    <textblock>Take notice that on January 24, 1994, Williams Gas Processing-Mid-Continent Region Company (WGP-MCR), Post Office Box 3102, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74101, filed a petition for a declaratory order in Docket No. CP94-197-000, requesting that the Commission declare that certain natural gas gathering facilities currently owned by Williams Natural Gas Company (WNG) are exempt from the Commission's Regulations pursuant to Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) upon WGP-MCR acquiring, owning, and operating such facilities, all as more fully set forth in the application which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.</textblock>
    <textblock>WGP-MCR will acquire most of WNG's gathering systems. The facilities are located in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The acquisition will include two small processing facilities (the Guymon Drip Control Plant and the Pampa Drip Control Plant). The facilities are approximately 800 miles of two-inch through twenty-six-inch.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to be heard or to make a protest with reference to said petition should, on or before March 8, 1994, file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426) a motion to intervene or a protest in accordance with the requirements of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 or 385.214). All protests filed with the Commission will be considered by it in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make the protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party to a proceeding or to participate as a party in any hearing therein must file a motion to intervene in accordance with the Commission's Rules.</textblock>
