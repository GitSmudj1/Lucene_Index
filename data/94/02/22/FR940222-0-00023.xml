    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This action modifies the Class D airspace at Hood Army Airfield (AAF) and Robert Gray AAF, and establishes Class E airspace at Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, TX. In accordance with airspace reclassification, effective September 16, 1993, the Class D airspace encompassing Killeen Municipal Airport required aircraft operators to establish two-way communications with Hood AAF Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT), or when Hood ATCT was closed, Robert Gray AAF ATCT. This action removes the airspace surrounding Killeen Municipal Airport from Hood AAF's Class D airspace, and establishes Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport. This action is intended to maintain adequate Class D airspace and two-way radio communications at Hood AAF and Robert Gray AAF, while removing Killeen Municipal Airport, TX, from the current Class D airspace, and establishing Class E airspace around Killeen Municipal Airport, Killeen, TX.</textblock>
