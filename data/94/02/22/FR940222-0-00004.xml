    <textblock>The FAA cannot determine the sizes of all the affected non-individual owner entities nor the relative significance of the costs estimated above. Because of these uncertainties, no cost thresholds for significant economic impact can be reasonably determined. Based on the possibility that this AD could have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities, the FAA conducted a regulatory flexibility analysis. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption</textblock>

    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this final rule does costs not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is significant under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979) because of substantial public interest; and, (3) may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The FAA has conducted an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Determination and Analysis and has considered alternatives to this action that could minimize the impact on small entities. A copy of this analysis may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption</textblock>

    <textblock>. After careful consideration, the FAA has determined that the required action is the best course to achieve the safety objective of returning the airplane to its original certification level of safety.</textblock>

    <textblock>Adoption of the Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:</textblock>

    <textblock>2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new AD to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>94-04-12 Twin Commander Aircraft Corporation:</textblock>
    <textblock>Amendment 39-8832; Docket No. 92-CE-38-AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability:</textblock>
    <textblock>The following Model and serial number airplanes that do not have the wing front spar lower cap replaced in accordance with the procedures of one of the two specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this AD, certificated in any category:</textblock>
    <textblock>Note 1:</textblock>
    <textblock>The serial number of the Model 685 airplanes differs from that specified in Twin Commander Service Bulletin (SB) No. 211, Revision 1, dated July 7, 1992. This AD takes precedence over that service information.</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance:</textblock>
    <textblock>Required within the next 50 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished.</textblock>
    <textblock>To prevent failure of the wing structure caused by a cracked wing front spar lower cap or cracked or deformed wing rib at Wing Station (WS) 39, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Modify the wing ribs at WS 39 in accordance with Part II of the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of Twin Commander SB No. 211, Revision 1, dated July 7, 1992.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Eddy current inspect the wing front spar lower cap and lower wing stringer No. 7 at WS 39 for cracks or corrosion in accordance with Part I of the ACCOMPLISHMENT INSTRUCTIONS section of Twin Commander SB No. 211, Revision 1, dated July 7, 1992.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) If any corrosion is found that is less than .031 inch in the thin flange or .063 inch in the thick section of the wing front lower spar cap, prior to further flight, treat the wing front spar lower cap area that is corroded with corrosion inhibitor such as LPS-3 or ACF-50.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) If any cracks are found or any corrosion is found that is equal to or exceeds .031 inch in the thin flange or .063 inch in the thick section of the wing front spar lower cap, prior to further flight, replace the wing front spar lower cap in accordance with the instructions in one of the following, as applicable:</textblock>
