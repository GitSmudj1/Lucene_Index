    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This is notice in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 209(c)(1) and 37 CFR 404.7(a)(1)(i) that the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Department of Health and Human Services, is no longer contemplating the grant of an exclusive license in the United States to practice the invention embodied in U.S. Patent Number 4,797,368 (SN 06/712,236), entitled ``Adeno-Associated Virus As Eukaryotic Expression Vector'' to Theragen, Inc., of Ann Arbor, Michigan. Based upon written evidence and argument received in response to a</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>notice (Vol. 57, No. 169, Monday, August 31, 1992, page 39405), the NIH has established that the grant of the license would not be consistent with the requirements of 35 U.S.C. 209 and 37 CFR 404.7 and that U.S. Patent 4,797,368 should be licensed on a non-exclusive basis for the field of gene therapy. The patent rights in this invention have been assigned to the United States of America.</textblock>
    <textblock>The patent describes a novel expression vector based on the parvovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), which is valuable for the stable maintenance or expression of DNA sequences or genes in eukaryotic cells. The use of many previously available virus-based eukaryotic expression vectors has been limited because they do not integrate foreign DNA into the host genome at high frequency and are not easily rescued from their host. This AAV-based expression vector is easily rescued from the host and allows the host to express the foreign DNA or genes at high frequency.</textblock>
