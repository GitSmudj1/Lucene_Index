    <textblock>I. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The DOE previously used the Cost and Schedule Control System Criteria (CSCSC) to evaluate management systems on selected contracts. A recent internal directive, DOE Notice 4700.5, Project Control System Guidelines (Notice), revised the method for applying control systems to the management of projects by expanding upon and replacing the CSCSC. The new approach includes explicit technical and schedule baseline development and control in addition to cost control. The previous directive addressing this issue, DOE Order 2250.1D, Cost and Schedule Control Systems Criteria, has been canceled. DOE Project Managers are responsible for determining the applicability of the Project Control System and the extent to which the requirements of the Notice will be utilized in individual contracts. Project Managers will have the flexibility to tailor requirements, encourage formulation of customized project control strategies for each project or group of projects, and emphasize the appropriate degree of application for each guideline element to effectively control technical, schedule, and cost risks.</textblock>
