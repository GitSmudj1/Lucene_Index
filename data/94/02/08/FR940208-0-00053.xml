    <textblock>VI. Effect of Director's Decision</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 503 of SMCRA provides that a State may not excercise jurisdiction under SMCRA unless the State program is approved by the Secretary. Similarly 30 CFR 732.17(a) requires that any alteration of an approved State program be submitted to OSM for review as a program amendment. Thus, any changes to the State program are not enforceable until approved by OSM. The Federal regulations at 732.17(g) prohibit any unilateral changes to approved State programs. In the oversight of the Iowa program, the Director will recognize only the statutes, regulations, and other materials approved by OSM, together with any consistent implementing policies, directives, and other materials, and will require the enforcement by Iowa of only such provisions.</textblock>
    <textblock>VII. Procedural Determinations</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance with Executive Order 12778</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of the Interior has conducted the reviews required by section 2 of Executive Order 12778 (Civil Justice Reform) and has determined that this rule meets the applicable standards of subsections (a) and (b) of that section. However, these standards are not applicable to the actual language of State regulatory programs and program amendments since each such program is drafted and promulgated by a specific State, not by OSM. Under sections 503 and 505 of SMCRA (30 U.S.C. 1253 and 12550) and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR 730.11, 732.15, and 732.17(h)(10), decisions on proposed State regulatory programs and program amendments submitted by the States must be based solely on a determination of whether the submittal is consistent with SMCRA and its implementing Federal regulations and whether the other requirements of 30 CFR Parts 730, 731, and 732 have been met.</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance With Executive Order 12866</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule is exempted from review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (Regulatory Planning and Review).</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance With the National Environmental Policy Act</textblock>
    <textblock>No environmental impact statement is required for this rule since section 702(d) of SMCRA [30 U.S.C. 1292(d)] provides that agency decisions on proposed State regulatory program provisions do not constitute major Federal actions within the meaning of section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C).</textblock>
    <textblock>Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule does not contain information collection requirements that require approval by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3507</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance With the Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of the Interior has determined that this rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>). The State submittal which is the subject of this rule is based upon counterpart Federal regulations for which an economic analysis was prepared and certification made that such regulations would not have a significant economic effect upon a substantial number of small entities. Hence, this rule will ensure that existing requirements previously promulgated by OSM will be implemented by the State. In making the determination as to whether this rule would have a significant economic impact, the Department relied upon the data and assumptions for the counterpart Federal regulations.</textblock>
