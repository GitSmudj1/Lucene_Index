    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Chapter Nineteen of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism for replacing judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving imports from Canada or the United States with review by independent binational panels. If requested, these panels will expeditiously review final determinations to determine whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the importing country. Title IV of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement Implementation Agreement Act of 1988, Public Law No. 100-449, 102 Stat. 1851 (1988) amends United States law to implement Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement.</textblock>
    <textblock>The</textblock>
    <textblock>Article 1904 Panel Rules</textblock>
    <textblock>are intended to give effect to the panel review provisions of Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement by setting forth the procedures for commencing, conducting and completing panel reviews. Originally published on December 30, 1988 (53 FR 53212), the rules became effective on January 1, 1989, the date the Agreement entered into force. As a result of negotiations between the United States and Canada and, taking into account comments received from panelists and counsel for participants in panel reviews, the rules have been amended twice (54 FR 53165, Dec. 27, 1989; and 57 FR 26698, June 15, 1992). The further amendments to the</textblock>
    <textblock>Article 1904 Panel Rules</textblock>
    <textblock>contained in this notice are the result of negotiations between the United States and Canada prompted by the desire to modify certain procedures in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Article 1904 Panel Rules.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consequently, these amendments improve the panel review process.</textblock>
    <textblock>A summary of the amendments to the</textblock>
    <textblock>Article 1904 Panel Rules</textblock>
    <textblock>is contained in the following section-by-section analysis. Amendments involving typographical errors, corrected cross-referencing, minor ministerial corrections, and any other changes not explained below, are considered drafting clarifications and have no substantive significance.</textblock>
    <textblock>Preamble</textblock>
    <textblock>The Preamble has been amended to incorporate the amendments contained herein into the legislative history of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Article 1904 Panel Rules.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 1A</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 1A has been added in view of the entry into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA'') and in light of the possibility that a Party may withdraw from NAFTA. The Article 1904 Panel Rules</textblock>
    <textblock>govern panel review of any final determination published or, in the case of a determination that is not published, for which notice is received, prior to the entry into force of the NAFTA. If either Canada or the United States were to withdraw from the NAFTA, the Agreement would revive between them and these rules again would apply.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 2</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 2 has been amended by deleting the provision that the</textblock>
    <textblock>Article 1904 Panel Rules</textblock>
    <textblock>shall not be construed to extend or limit the jurisdiction of the panels. This provision is inconsistent with rule 7. As amended, the final sentence of rule 2 clarifies that the Agreement prevails where there is an inconsistency or ambiguity between the</textblock>
    <textblock>Article 1904 Panel Rules</textblock>
    <textblock>and the Agreement.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 2A</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 2A has been added to provide that these amendments to the rules shall not apply to any panel proceeding pending on January 1, 1994 where, in the opinion of the panel, their application would be impracticable or would be prejudicial to a participant.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 3</textblock>
    <textblock>The definition of ``Disclosure Undertaking'' has been added to eliminate the need to refer to the form of the undertaking in the body of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Article 1904 Panel Rules</textblock>
    <textblock>or in an attached schedule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The definition of ``investigating authority'' has been amended to include a delegation of power by the competent investigating authority in matters regarding the issuance, amendment, modification and revocation of Disclosure Orders and Protective Orders.</textblock>
    <textblock>The definition of ``Protective Order Application'' has been added to eliminate the need to refer to the form of the application in the body of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Article 1904 Panel Rules</textblock>
    <textblock>or in an attached schedule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The definition of ``service address'' has been rephrased to clarify that an address, rather than a facsimile number, is the principal service address.</textblock>
    <textblock>The definition of ``service list'' with respect to a panel review where the final determination was made in Canada has been amended to clarify that the panel review process is restricted to goods of the United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 15</textblock>
    <textblock>Subrule 15(a) has been amended to ensure that a document containing proprietary or privileged information filed with the responsible Secretariat is treated in accordance with the terms of an applicable Disclosure Order or Protective Order.</textblock>
