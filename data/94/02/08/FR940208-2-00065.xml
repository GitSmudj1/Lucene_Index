    <textblock>By an application dated January 6, 1994, Local</textblock>
    <textblock>#</textblock>
    <textblock>724 of the International Union of Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers (IUE) requested administrative reconsideration of the subject petition for trade adjustment assistance. The denial notice was signed on December 9, 1993 and was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on December 28, 1993 (58 FR 68668).</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to 29 CFR 90.18(c) reconsideration may be granted under the following circumstances:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) If it appears on the basis of facts not previously considered that the determination complained of was erroneous;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) If it appears that the determination complained of was based on a mistake in the determination of facts not previously considered; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) If in the opinion of the Certifying Officer, a misinterpretation of facts or of the law justified reconsideration of the decision.</textblock>
    <textblock>The union states that some production of generators, small motors and converters formerly produced at Lima were produced in Puerto Rico.</textblock>
    <textblock>Investigation findings show that the Department's denial was based on the fact that the ``contributed importantly'' test of the Group Eligibility Requirements of the Trade Act was not met. This test is generally demonstrated through a survey of the workers' firm's customers. The Department's survey of Sundstrand Electrical Power Systems major declining customers shows that none of the respondents reported purchasing imported generators, small motors or converters during the relevant period.</textblock>
    <textblock>Further, Puerto Rico is within the U.S. Customs boundary, accordingly, and production in Puerto Rico is considered domestic production and is not an import.</textblock>
    <textblock>Conclusion</textblock>
    <textblock>After review of the application and investigative findings, I conclude that there has been no error or misinterpretation of the law or of the facts which would justify reconsideration of the Department of Labor's prior decision. Accordingly, the application is denied.</textblock>
    <textblock>Signed at Washington, DC, this 25th day of January 1994.</textblock>
