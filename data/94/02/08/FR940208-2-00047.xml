    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is withdrawing approval of four new animal drug applications (NADA's) held by Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, Pharmachem Corp., Sanofi Animal Health, Inc., and Squire Laboratories, Inc.

In a final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>, FDA is amending the regulations by removing the entries which reflect approval of the NADA's.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The sponsors of the NADA's listed in the table in this document have informed FDA that these animal drug products are no longer marketed or distributed and have requested that FDA withdraw approval of the applications.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, under authority delegated to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (21 CFR 5.10) and redelegated to the Center for Veterinary Medicine (21 CFR 5.84), and in accordance with ยง514.115</textblock>
    <textblock>Withdrawal of approval of applications</textblock>
    <textblock>(21 CFR 514.115), notice is given that approval of NADA's 10-783, 11-871, 132-137, and 138-455 and all supplements and amendments thereto is hereby withdrawn, effective February 18, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>In a final rule published elsewhere in this issue of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>, FDA is removing the text of and reserving 21 CFR 520.1962(b) and amending 21 CFR 524.1580d(b) to reflect the withdrawal of approval of NADA's 10-783 and 138-455, respectively. It is unnecessary to amend the regulations to reflect withdrawal of approval of the other two NADA's because NADA 11-871 was never codified and the sponsor of NADA 132-137 (Sanofi) has been previously removed from the regulation.</textblock>
