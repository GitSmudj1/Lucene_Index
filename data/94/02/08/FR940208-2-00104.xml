    <textblock>To the extent that trading volume in the CXM may be lower than originally was forseen, the Exchange argues that the current capital requirements is too burdensome for the DPM and should be lowered to a level that is more commensurate with the DPM's actual exposure to risk. After careful review of the proposed rule change, the Commission continues to believe that the DPM should have adequate capital to conduct his or her market making activities. Accordingly, in these particular circumstances, the Commission believes that it is not inconsistent with the Act for the CHX to reduce the DPM's capital requirement that is set forth in the Exchange rules governing basket trading.</textblock>
    <textblock>In reaching the above conclusion, however, the Commission placed great weight on the CHX's representations regarding the depth and liquidity of the prevailing market for the CXM. The Commission expects and the Exchange has agreed that, if there is a significant increase in basket trading volume, then the CHX will reconsider the adequacy of its reduced capital requirement and, if appropriate, submit another proposed rule change to the Commission.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. The Commission believes that accelerated approval of this proposal should allow a regulatory burden to be reduced immediately, thereby facilitating the efficient allocation of market making capital.</textblock>
    <textblock>It Is Therefore Ordered,</textblock>
    <textblock>pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act</textblock>
    <textblock>that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-CHX-94-01) is hereby approved.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.</textblock>
