  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission amends its regulations designating certain State and local fair employment practices agencies as certified designated agencies. The designation permits the Commission to accept the findings and resolutions of State and local fair employment practices agencies in regard to most cases processed under contract without individual, case-by-case substantial weight reviews by the Commission. Publication of this amendment effectuates the designation of the Delaware Department of Labor and the Howard County (MD) Office of Human Rights as certified designated FEP agencies.</textblock>
