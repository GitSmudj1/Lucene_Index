    <textblock>Effects of the Designation</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed rule for the designation of critical habitat for the desert tortoise published on August 30, 1993, identified 12 areas encompassing a total of approximately 6.6 million acres. It included eight CHUs totaling 4.8 million acres in California, four CHUs totaling 1.3 million acres in Nevada, two CHUs totalling 137,200 acres in Utah, and two CHUs totaling 417,400 acres in Arizona. This included 5 million acres of BLM land, 247,400 acres of military lands, 151,200 acres of National Park Service land, 170,100 acres of State lands, 1,600 acres of Tribal lands, 1,079,500 acres of private lands, and 100 acres of Forest Service land. A summary of changes in acreage between the proposed rule and this final rule are provided in Table 1.</textblock>
