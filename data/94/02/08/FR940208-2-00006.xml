    <textblock>Dear Commissioner: Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on December 9, 1993; pursuant to the Bilateral Cotton, Man-Made Fiber, Silk Blend and Other Vegetable Fiber Textile Agreement, effected by exchange of notes dated May 20, 1987 and June 11, 1987, as amended and extended, and the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated January 21, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and Pakistan; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on February 9, 1994, entry into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton and man-made fiber textile products in the following categories, produced or manufactured in Pakistan and exported during the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994, in excess of the following levels of restraint:</textblock>
