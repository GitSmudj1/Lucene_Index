    <textblock>February 2, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Take notice that on January 31, 1994, South Georgia Natural Gas Company (South Georgia) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Second Revised Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheets, to be effective February 1, 1994:</textblock>
    <textblock>First Revised Sheet No. 55</textblock>
    <textblock>First Revised Sheet No. 55a</textblock>
    <textblock>First Revised Sheet No. 55b</textblock>
    <textblock>South Georgia states that the purpose of this filing is to offer an optional delivery point allocation methodology in its transportation tariff. This option would allow any party who owns and operates the downstream facilities at a delivery point on South Georgia's system to elect to have daily deliveries at such point allocated first to third-party transportation agreements nominating at that point. South Georgia has been requested to implement this ``swing contract'' option so that the downstream operator can choose to keep third-party shippers whole to the extent of metered flow. South Georgia has requested all waivers necessary to make these sheets effective February 1, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>South Georgia states that copies of the filing will be served upon its shippers and interested state commissions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a petition to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rules 211 and 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR Sections 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions and protests should be filed on or before February 9, 1994. Protests will not be considered by the Commission in determining the parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.</textblock>
