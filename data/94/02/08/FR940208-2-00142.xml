    <textblock>Rule 22</textblock>
    <textblock>In subrule 22(1), the cross-reference to rule 52 has been deleted because a person now must file with the responsible Secretariat one original and eight copies of a Disclosure Order or Protective Order, or any amendment or modification thereto, or notice of revocation thereof. The cross-reference to subrule 75(2)(a) was added because only one copy of a supplementary remand record must be filed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 23</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 23 has been amended to clarify the responsibilities of the responsible Secretary for the service of documents. Under subrule (a), the responsible Secretary is no longer required to serve Complaints other than on the Parties. Now, a complainant is required under subrule 24(5) to serve a Complaint on the investigating authority and on all persons on the service list. Subrule 23(c) has been amended so that the responsible Secretary serves Notices of Appearance only on the participants.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subrule 23(d) has been amended to require that the responsible Secretary serve participants only with those Disclosure Orders and Protective Orders, any amendments or modifications thereto, and notices of revocation thereof granted to panelists, court reporters or translators. Now, subrule 24(1) provides that participants must serve their own Disclosure Orders and Protective Orders, any amendments or modifications thereto, and notices of revocation thereof. Subrule 23(d) also has been amended to require that the responsible Secretary serve participants with Notices of Final Panel Action.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 24</textblock>
    <textblock>Subrule 24(1) has been amended to add supplementary remand records to the list of documents exempt from the service requirements of subrule (1).

    <textblock>Rule 33</textblock>
    <textblock>Subrule 33(1)(a) has been amended to conform with the statutory requirement that a party provide timely notice of its intent to commence judicial review in cases involving Canadian merchandise. 19 U.S.C. 1516a(g)(3)(B). An interested person who intends to commence judicial review of a final determination made in the United States must serve a Notice of Intent to Commence Judicial Review on both Secretaries, the investigating authority, and all persons listed on the service list within 20 days of the date the final determination was published in the</textblock>

    <textblock>, or within 20 days of the date on which notice of the final determination was received by the other Party if the final determination was not published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 35</textblock>
    <textblock>Subrule 35(1)(c)(ii) has been amended to clarify that any person who does not file a Complaint but intends to participate in the panel review must file a Notice of Appearance.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 36</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 36, which provided for joint panel review of final determinations of dumping or subsidization with final determinations of affirmative injury, has been removed because the procedure had never been applied successfully in any panel review.</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 37</textblock>
    <textblock>Rule 37 requires joint panel review where a final affirmative antidumping or countervailing duty determination for a particular good and a final negative injury determination for that same good are both subject to a request for panel review.</textblock>
