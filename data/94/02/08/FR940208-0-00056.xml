    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Department of the Treasury Circular, Public Debt Series No. 21-75, dated July 10, 1975, provides for the offering and issuance of 2-Percent Depository Bonds.</textblock>
    <textblock>Two Percent Depositary Bonds are acceptable to secure deposits of Federal funds with, and the faithful performance of duties by, depositaries and financial agents, as designated in Part 348. The bonds have been offered to such depositaries and financial agents in an amount not to exceed the amount of their qualification.</textblock>
    <textblock>All outstanding 2-Percent Depositary Bonds have been redeemed by the Department of the Treasury. Depositaries and financial agents are receiving payments for expenses incurred in handling Federal funds through arrangements not involving 2-Percent Depositary Bonds. The offering of 2-Percent Depositary Bonds will terminate effective upon publication of this rule in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>Because all outstanding 2-Percent Depositary Bonds have been redeemed, part 348, which governs these securities, is unnecessary and, therefore, should be removed from title 31 of the CFR concurrent with termination of the offering.</textblock>
    <textblock>Special Analysis: Because this amendment relates to the terms and conditions of special purpose Treasury securities, the notice and public procedures, and the delayed effective date requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(a)(2)) are inapplicable. It has been determined that the rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of Executive Order No. 12688. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required, the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601,</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>) do not apply to this rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 348</textblock>
    <textblock>Banks, Banking, Bonds, Electronic funds transfer, Government securities.</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, 31 CFR part 348 is amended as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Part 348_[Removed]</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Part 348 is removed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dated: January 26, 1994.</textblock>
