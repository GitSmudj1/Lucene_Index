    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) proposes to amend its emergency loan (EM) regulations to revise the applicant eligibility calculation and appraisal requirements and to require crop insurance. This action is necessary to ease the EM eligibility requirements, to expedite EM application processing time, and to reduce losses to family-size farmers and the Government. The intended effect is to provide assistance to a greater number of farmers affected by major disasters in a timely manner.</textblock>
