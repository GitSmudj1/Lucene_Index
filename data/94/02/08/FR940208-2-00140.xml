    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>Canada and the United States have amended the rules of procedure for Article 1904 binational panel reviews. These amendments are intended to improve the panel review process under Chapter Nineteen of the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement in order to increase its efficiency and effectiveness.</textblock>
  </summary>
  <date>
    <textblock>EFFECTIVE DATE:</textblock>
    <textblock>February 8, 1994. The Rules of Procedure, herewithin, apply to all panel proceedings under the United States-Canada Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') commenced on or after, or pending on, the effective date, except that these Rules of Procedure shall not apply to the extent that in the opinion of the panel their application in a particular panel proceeding pending on the effective date would be impracticable or would be prejudicial to a participant, in which event the panel may apply the former procedure or such other procedure not inconsistent with the Agreement.</textblock>
    <textblock>Specifically, these Rules of Procedure govern panel review of any final determination published or, in the case of a determination that is not published, for which notice is received prior to January 1, 1994, the date of entry into force of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``NAFTA''). In the event that either Canada or the United States withdraws from the NAFTA, the Agreement would revive between them and these Rules of Procedure again would apply.</textblock>
