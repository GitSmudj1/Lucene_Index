Prior to any judicial challenge to the provisions of this rule or the application of its provisions all applicable administrative procedures must be exhausted. In the Food Stamp Program the administrative procedures are as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) For program benefit recipients_state administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2020(e)(10) and 7 CFR 273.15;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) For State agencies_administrative procedures issued pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2023 set out at 7 CFR 276.7 (for rules related to non-quality control (QC) liabilities) or part 284 (for rules related to QC liabilities);</textblock>
