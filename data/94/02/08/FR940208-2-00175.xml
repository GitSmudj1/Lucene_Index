    <textblock>Subrule 15(2) has been added to provide that the responsible Secretary shall file the Disclosure Undertaking or the Protective Order Application with the appropriate investigating authority.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subrules 15(3) and (4) address the requirements for issuance of a Disclosure Order or Protective Order. Former subrule 11(3) had provided that the person to whom the Disclosure Order or Protective Order was issued would file with the responsible Secretariat the order and the required number of copies. Under new subrule 15(3), the investigating authority issues the appropriate Order and transmit it to the responsible Secretary.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under subrule 15(4) the responsible Secretary, on receipt of the appropriate Order, transmits that Order to the person named in the Order. The rationale for this amendment was to ensure that the Secretary could act as the conduit for assembling, filing and receipt of Orders for all persons who are not counsel in an extraordinary challenge proceeding.</textblock>

    <textblock>Under subrule 16(2), the responsible Secretary then files the amendment or modification to the Disclosure Undertaking or Protective Order Application with the competent investigating authority.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under subrule 16(3), the competent investigating authority, as appropriate, amends, modifies or revokes the Disclosure Order or Protective Order and then transmits to the responsible Secretariat the amended or modified Order or the notice of revocation of the Order.</textblock>

A professional retained by counsel refers, for example, to a professional who is retained on a contractual basis. A professional under the control of counsel refers, for example, to an employee of counsel who is not hired on a contractual basis, but takes direction from counsel.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subrule 18(1) provides that a new counsel of record or such professional shall file a Disclosure Undertaking or Protective Order Application with the responsible Secretariat and with the competent investigating authority.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subrule 18(2) provides that the Disclosure Undertaking or Protective Order Application shall be served on all participants. Subrule 18(3) limits the competent investigating authority to 10 days after the filing of the Disclosure Undertaking or Protective Order Application to issue or to transmit reasons for not issuing a Disclosure Order or Protective Order.</textblock>

    <textblock>Subrule 19(1) provides that counsel may file a notice of motion requesting that a committee review the decision of a competent investigating authority refusing to issue a Disclosure Order or Protective Order to persons named in subrule 18(1) or issuing a Disclosure Order or Protective Order with terms unacceptable to a person named in subrule 18(1).</textblock>
    <textblock>Subrule 19(2) provides for notice by a committee to counsel and the competent investigating authority where the committee decides that an order should be issued or that the terms of a Disclosure Order or Protective Order should be amended or modified.</textblock>
