    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Following is a summary of the application; the complete application is available for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch.</textblock>
    <textblock>APPLICANT'S REPRESENTATIONS:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Applicant, a diversified open-end management company, is a Separate Account formed under Connecticut insurance laws by The Travelers Insurance Company (``Travelers''), a life insurance company domiciled in Connecticut.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. On June 10, 1968, Applicant filed a Notice of Registration on Form N-8B-1 under Section 8(b) of the 1940 Act (File No. 811-2583) and a Registration Statement on Form S-5 under the Securities Act of 1933 (File No. 2-54173) to register units of interest of variable annuity contracts (``Contracts''). Applicant's Registration Statement became effective on December 18, 1968 and the initial public offering commenced on that date.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. On November 19, 1993, the Contracts were exchanged for another Travelers' variable annuity contract (``New Contract``) pursuant to an offer of exchange extended by Travelers to Contractowners on September 10, 1992. All Contractowners contacted either consented to the offer to exchange or surrendered their contracts. The New Contract has as an investment option The Travelers Growth and Income Stock Account for Variable Annuities (``Account GS''). Account GS is an investment company with identical investment objectives, adviser and management fees as the Applicant. The charges under the New Contract are equal to or lower than those under the existing Contract. All units in Applicant held under the existing contracts were exchanged for units of equal value in Account GS under the New Contract. The offer of exchange was made in compliance with Rule 11a-2 under the 1940 Act. All portfolio securities of the Applicant were transferred to Account GS, valued on the basis of net asset values of the securities as determined in accordance with the methods set forth in the Statement of Additional Information of the Applicant and Account GS. No brokerage commissions were paid. The transfer of portfolio securities was made pursuant to a Commission order under section 17(b) granting an exemption from Section 17(a) of the 1940 Act. (Release No. 1C-19232, File No. 812-8172.)</textblock>
    <textblock>4. As of November 18, 1993, Applicant had 1,769,541.5358 units of interest outstanding and net assets of $13,238,482.89, representing 7,467170 Contracts issued prior to December 23, 1983 and 7.289487 Contracts issued subsequent to that date.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Any expenses connected with the offer of exchange of the liquidation of the Applicant will be paid by Travelers.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. Applicant has no remaining assets, and no debts or liabilities remain outstanding. No distributions were made to Applicant's securityholders. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. There are no securityholders of Applicant.</textblock>
    <textblock>7. Applicant is not now engaged nor does it propose to engage in any business activities other than those necessary for the winding-up of its affairs.</textblock>
    <textblock>8. Applicant has not, within the last 18 months, transferred any of its assets to a separate trust, the beneficiaries of which were or are security holders of Applicant.</textblock>
    <textblock>9. Travelers intends to notify the Connecticut and New York Insurance Departments, each having approved the transfer of assets, that it no longer intends to utilize the Applicant as a separate account.</textblock>
    <textblock>10. Applicant has made on a timely basis all filings on Form N-SAR required under the 1940 Act. Applicant's last filing on Form N-SAR for the period ended June 30, 1993, was made on or before August 30, 1993.</textblock>
