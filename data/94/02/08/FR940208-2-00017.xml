    <textblock>February 2, 1994</textblock>
    <textblock>Take notice that on January 28, 1994 Eastern Shore Natural Gas Company (Eastern Shore) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, certain revised tariff included in Appendix A attached to the filing. Such sheets are proposed to be effective February 1, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Eastern Shore states that the purpose of the instant filing is two fold: (1) to reflect changes in the demand and commodity sales rates; and (2) to track changes in Eastern Shore's pipeline supplier's storage service rates.</textblock>
    <textblock>Eastern Shore states that it seeks to increase its CD Commodity sales rate and reduce its CD Demand sales rate by $0.2247 and $0.0134 per dt, respectively, as compared to those sales rates filed in Docket Nos. TQ94-3-23-000 and TM94-5-23-000. Such changes reflect higher prices being paid to Eastern Shore's suppliers under its market responsive gas contracts and lower prices being paid to Eastern Shore's upstream pipeline suppliers for firm transportation.</textblock>
    <textblock>Eastern Shore states that copies of the filing have been served upon its jurisdictional customers and interested State Commissions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to be heard or to protest said filing should file a motion to intervene or protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 and Rule 214 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211 and 385.214). All such motions or protests should be filed on or before February 9, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Any person wishing to become a party must file a motion to intervene. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.</textblock>
