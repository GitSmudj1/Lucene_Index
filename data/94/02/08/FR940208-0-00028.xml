During this time period, pursuant to Federal regulations at 30 CFR 732.17, OSM notified Iowa in four separate 732 letters dated December 12, 1988, (Administrative Record No. IA-336); May 11, 1989, (Administrative Record No. IA-340); November 28, 1989, (Administrative Record No. IA-347); and February 7, 1990, (Administrative Record IA-349), that the State rules must be amended to be consistent with the revised Federal regulations.</textblock>
    <textblock>By letter dated November 23, 1992 (Administrative Record No. IA-372), Iowa submitted a proposed amendment to its program pursuant to SMCRA. Iowa submitted the proposed amendment with the intent of satisfying the outstanding 732 notifications from OSM and the required program amendments OSM placed on its program in a November 6, 1991, rulemaking action (56 FR 56578) at 30 CFR 915.16(a) of the Federal regulations.</textblock>
