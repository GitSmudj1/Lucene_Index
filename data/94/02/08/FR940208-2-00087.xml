    <textblock>The Amex has reported to the Commission, on a monthly basis, the number of trade and share volume of orders executed after the close pursuant to the pilot procedures. In addition, on May 21, 1993, and September 30, 1993, the Exchange filed with the Commission reports which address the Exchange's experience with the AHT pilot through September 1, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission expects the Exchange to submit to the Commission by March 15, 1994, an updated report concerning pilot activity through February 28, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission believes that it is reasonable to extend the pilot program in order to provide the Amex and Commission with additional time to review the pilot program. The pilot extension also will provide the Commission with an opportunity to study the reports supplied by the Amex. During the pilot extension, the Commission expects that the Amex will continue to monitor the operation of the AHT pilot program. In addition, the Commission continues to request that the Exchange keep the Commission apprised of any technical problems or patterns of manipulation or trading abuses which may arise regarding the operation of the new rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission finds good cause for approving the proposed rule change prior to the thirtieth day after the date of publication of notice of filing thereof in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission believes that accelerated approval of the proposal is appropriate in order to allow the Amex procedures to remain in place on an uninterrupted basis. This will permit the Amex to continue to compete with the NYSE's OHT facility, which in turn should benefit investors and promote competition among markets.</textblock>
    <textblock>It is therefore ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act</textblock>
    <textblock>that a portion of the proposed rule change (Amex-93-15), as discussed above, is hereby approved on a pilot basis through April 30, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegated authority.</textblock>
