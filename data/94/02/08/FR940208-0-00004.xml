    <textblock>Section 903 of the FACT Act and Pub. L. 102-265 provide for a</textblock>
    <textblock>food stamp exclusion for amounts necessary for the fulfillment of</textblock>
    <textblock>a PASS. In the proposed rule, the amendatory language for 7 CFR</textblock>
    <textblock>273.9(c)</textblock>
    <textblock>Income exclusions</textblock>
    <textblock>was: ``Income of an SSI recipient</textblock>
    <textblock>which has been determined necessary for the fulfillment of a plan</textblock>
    <textblock>for achieving self-support (PASS) *␣*␣*.'' The second commenter</textblock>
    <textblock>objected to the phrase ``which has been determined'' in the</textblock>
    <textblock>regulatory amendment. The commenter objected to the language</textblock>
    <textblock>because it believes that the phrase unnecessarily complicates the</textblock>
    <textblock>issue because the language in Section 903 of the FACT Act</textblock>
    <textblock>specifies exclusion of income necessary for fulfillment of a</textblock>
    <textblock>PASS. The Department has adopted the commenter's suggestion and</textblock>
    <textblock>deleted the phrase ``which has been determined'' from the final</textblock>
    <textblock>rule. Other than this deletion, the rule at 7 CFR 273.9(c)(17) is</textblock>
    <textblock>adopted as proposed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Implementation and Effective Dates</textblock>
    <textblock>The provisions extending food stamp eligibility to all blind or</textblock>
    <textblock>disabled persons (as defined by the Food Stamp Act) who live in</textblock>
    <textblock>certain group living arrangements and to include meals served to</textblock>
    <textblock>these blind or disabled persons as eligible for purchase with</textblock>
    <textblock>food stamps were effective and had to be implemented no later</textblock>
    <textblock>than February 1, 1992 in accordance with the provisions of the</textblock>
    <textblock>FACT Act and with a December 27, 1991 memorandum to all Regional</textblock>
    <textblock>Administrators of the Food and Nutrition Service.</textblock>
    <textblock>Also in accordance with that memorandum and the provisions of the</textblock>
    <textblock>FACT Act, the income exclusion for PASS accounts is effective on</textblock>
    <textblock>the earlier of: (1) December 13, 1991, the date of enactment of</textblock>
    <textblock>the FACT Act, (2) October 1, 1990, for food stamp households for</textblock>
    <textblock>which the State agency knew, or had notice, that a household</textblock>
    <textblock>member had a PASS, or (3) beginning on the date that a fair</textblock>
    <textblock>hearing was requested contesting the denial of an income</textblock>
    <textblock>exclusion for amounts provided for a PASS. State agencies are</textblock>
    <textblock>not required to do file searches for cases relating to PASS</textblock>
    <textblock>households unless the question of an income exclusion for PASS</textblock>
    <textblock>had been raised with the State agency prior to December 13, 1991.</textblock>
