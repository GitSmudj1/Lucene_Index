    <textblock>An upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) is prevalent in captive desert tortoises and has been identified in wild desert tortoises in many localities in the western Mojave Desert and in limited localities elsewhere. URTD appears to be spreading and may have been introduced to wild populations through illegal releases of diseased captive desert tortoises. Wild desert tortoises with signs of URTD are commonly found near cities and towns with concentrations of captive desert tortoises (Marlow and Brussard 1993). Disease has contributed to high mortality rates in the western Mojave Desert in the last 4 years (Avery and Berry 1990, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993).</textblock>
    <textblock>Recent studies have demonstrated</textblock>
    <textblock>Mycoplasma agassizii</textblock>
    <textblock>sp. nov. as the causative agent of URTD. Predisposing factors, such as habitat degradation, poor nutrition, and drought, are likely involved in increasing the susceptibility of individual animals to disease (Jacobson</textblock>
    <textblock>et al.</textblock>
    <textblock>1991). Drought and concomitant poor nutrition have the potential to compromise desert tortoises immunologically and, therefore, make them more susceptible to URTD and other diseases. Controlling human-related spread of URTD, improving habitat conditions, and monitoring health status of desert tortoise populations are some of the more important management tools that can be used in controlling URTD in wild populations of the desert tortoise (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993).</textblock>
    <textblock>A shell disease has also been observed in the Chuckwalla Bench population in the eastern Colorado Desert (Jacobson</textblock>
    <textblock>et al.</textblock>
    <textblock>1992). A variety of mineral and metal deficiencies, as well as various toxicants, are known to cause integumentary pathology in mammals, suggesting disease or toxicosis may be responsible for these observed shell abnormalities (U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 1993). Another shell disease, osteopenia, occurs in desert tortoise populations on the Beaver Dam Slope and may be related to poor nutrition (Jarchow and May 1989).</textblock>
    <textblock>Criteria for Identifying Critical Habitat</textblock>
    <textblock>The maintenance of stable, self-sustaining, and well-distributed populations of desert tortoises throughout their range is dependent upon habitat quality and its ability to support viable populations. The biological and physical characteristics of the desert ecosystem that support nesting, foraging, sheltering, dispersal, and/or gene flow are essential for this purpose. The Service based its designation of critical habitat on those areas recommended for recovery of the desert tortoise in the Draft Recovery Plan.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Draft Recovery Plan proposes 14 DWMAs within 6 recovery units within the range of the desert tortoise. The Service used the DWMAs as the basis for CHUs because:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The Draft Recovery Plan's conservation strategy is based upon the best available information on desert tortoises gathered and analyzed over the past 20 years;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The Draft Recovery Plan represents an in-depth analysis of the conservation needs of the desert tortoise;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) The areas recommended as DWMAs were proposed by experts familiar with the species and its habitat based on the principles of conservation biology; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Use of the DWMAs is consistent with the Service's other conservation efforts (e.g., it has been the focus in section 7 consultations and conservation planning).</textblock>
    <textblock>The Service's identification of areas consistent with the proposed DWMAs containing the primary constituent elements described above was based on the seven principles of conservation biology used in the Draft Recovery Plan:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Reserves should be well-distributed across a species' native range;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Reserves should contain large blocks of habitat with large populations of the target species;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Blocks of habitat should be close together;</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Reserves should contain contiguous rather than fragmented habitat;</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Habitat patches should contain minimal edge to area ratios;</textblock>
    <textblock>(6) Blocks should be interconnected by corridors or linkages containing protected, preferred habitat for the target species; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(7) Blocks of habitat should be roadless or otherwise inaccessible to humans.</textblock>
    <textblock>Critical habitat is based on the framework of the Draft Recovery Plan. Should a final approved recovery plan vary significantly from the draft, or significantly change the assumptions underlying this critical habitat designation, then the Service may reevaluate critical habitat boundaries.</textblock>
