    <textblock>Probable cause.</textblock>
    <textblock>As used in this rule, ``probable cause'' exists if the facts and circumstances that are known to the Warden would warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an offense has been committed.</textblock>

    <textblock>Prohibited object.</textblock>
    <textblock>A firearm or destructive device; ammunition; a weapon or an object that is designed or intended to be used as a weapon or to facilitate escape from a prison; a narcotic drug, lysergic acid diethylamide, or phencyclidine; a controlled substance or alcoholic beverage; any United States or foreign currency; and any other object that threatens the order, discipline, or security of a prison, or the life, health, or safety of an individual.</textblock>
