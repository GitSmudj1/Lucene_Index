    <textblock>Take notice that on December 16, 1993, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company (Williston Basin), tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, Original Volume No. 1, the following tariff sheet:</textblock>
    <textblock>Effective December 1, 1993</textblock>
    <textblock>Sub Forth-ninth Revised Sheet No. 11B</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 13, 1993, Williston Basin submitted for filing its compliance filing in Docket No. RP94-48-001. The filing was made in compliance with the Commission's December 3, 1993, Order to reflect the annual principal amount (plus interest) of the ten percent of Gas Supply Realignment Transition Costs as an allocated costs attributable to interruptible transportation service provided under Rate Schedule IT-1 and the removal of the facilities transferred by Williston Basin to Koch Hydrocarbon Company from Williston Basin's rate base.</textblock>
    <textblock>Upon further review of its December 13 filing, Williston Basin noticed that Forty-ninth Revised sheet No. 11B contains an inadvertent error. Rate Schedule X-13 should not have reflected the take-or-pay throughput surcharge of 21.251 cents per Dkt. Williston Basin is therefore submitting herewith a corrected, Sub Forth-ninth Revised Sheet No. 11B, to replace Forth-ninth Revised Sheet No. 11B submitted on December 13, 1993. The change to this tariff sheet has no effect on any other rates.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with Rule 211 of the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure (18 CFR 385.211). All such protests should be filed on or before February 25, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to the proceeding. Copies of the filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public inspection.</textblock>
