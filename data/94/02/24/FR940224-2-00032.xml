    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 3517 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. chapter 3517) requires that the Director of OMB provide interested Federal agencies and persons an early opportunity to comment on information collection requests. OMB may amend or waive the requirement for public consultation to the extent that public participation in the approval process would defeat the purpose of the information collection, violate State or Federal law, or substantially interfere with any agency's ability to perform its statutory obligations.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Director, Information Resources Management Service, publishes this notice with the attached proposed information collection request prior to submission of this request to OMB. This notice contains the following information: (1) Type of review requested, e.g., expedited; (2) Title; (3) Abstract; (4) Additional Information; (5) Frequency of collection; (6) Affected public; and (7) Reporting and/or Recordkeeping burden. Because an expedited review is requested, a description of the information to be collected is also included as an attachment to this notice.</textblock>
