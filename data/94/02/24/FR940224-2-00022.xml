    <textblock>Commissioner of Customs,</textblock>
    <textblock>Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dear Commissioner: The directive issued to you on November 16, 1993, by the Chairman, Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements, directs you to count imports of certain textiles and textile products, produced or manufactured in Macau and exported during the period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994. Effective on February 25, 1994, you are directed to no longer monitor those categories for which import restraint limits are not being established in this directive. Monitoring data for the remaining categories shall be applied to the limits established below.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on December 9, 1993; pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding dated January 28, 1994 between the Governments of the United States and Macau; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on</textblock>
    <textblock>XX</textblock>
    <textblock>, entry into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of cotton, wool, man-made fiber, silk blend and other vegetable fiber textiles and textile products in the following categories, produced or manufactured in Macau and exported during the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994, in excess of the following levels of restraint:</textblock>
    <textblock>Imports charged to these category limits for the period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993 shall be charged against those levels of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balances. In the event the limits established for that period have been exhausted by previous entries, such goods shall be subject to the levels set forth in this directive.</textblock>
    <textblock>Import charges for part-Categories 359-C/659-C, 359-V and 659-S shall be provided at a later date.</textblock>
    <textblock>The conversion factor (square meters equivalent/category unit) for Categories 445/446 is 12.4.</textblock>
    <textblock>In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Committee for the Implementation of Textile Agreements has determined that these actions fall within the foreign affairs exception of the rulemaking provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553(a)(1).</textblock>
