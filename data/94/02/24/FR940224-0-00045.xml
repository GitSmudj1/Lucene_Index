    <textblock>PART 770_[AMENDED]</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Section 770.2 is amended by revising the definition of ``supercomputers'' to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§770.2</textblock>
    <textblock>Definitions of terms.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>Supercomputer.</textblock>
    <textblock>A ``supercomputer'' is any computer with a Composite Theoretical Performance (CTP) equal to or exceeding 1,500 Mtops (million theoretical operations per second). For calculation of CTP, see the Technical Note that follows the Advisory Notes for Category 4 in the Commerce Control List (Supplement No. 1 to §799.1 of this subchapter).</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 772_[AMENDED]</textblock>
    <textblock>5. Section 772.1 is amended by adding a new paragraph (h) to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§772.1</textblock>
    <textblock>General provisions.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(h)</textblock>
    <textblock>Terminating validated license conditions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Exporters who have shipped under validated licenses containing conditions that would not apply to an export under a general license, and foreign consignees who have agreed to such conditions, are no longer bound by the conditions when the licensed items become eligible for shipment under a general license (e.g., GFW, GCT, G-DEST). Items that were exported under such licenses remain subject to the conditions of permissive reexports and any applicable general licenses on which they are based, as well as the general prohibitions in §771.2(c) of this subchapter on the use of general licenses. Termination of validated license conditions does not relieve persons of responsibility for any violations that may have occurred before availability of a general license.</textblock>
