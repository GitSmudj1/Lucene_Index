    <textblock>Need for Correction</textblock>
    <textblock>As published, the notice of eligibility (CGD 93-092) contains an error which requires correction. In describing to which vessels certain requirements of the Passenger Vessel Safety Act apply, the word ``and'' was used rather than the correct word ``or''.</textblock>
    <textblock>Correction of Publication</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, the publication on January 6, 1994, of the notice of eligibility (CGD 91-035), which is the subject of FR document 94-262, is corrected as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. On page 793, under the subtitle ``Possible Modified Regulations for Certain Existing Passenger Vessels'' in the first paragraph of the second column, ``(a) At least 100 gross tons but less than 300 gross tons, and;'' is corrected to read ``(a) At least 100 gross tons but less than 300 gross tons; or''.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dated: February 15, 1994.</textblock>
