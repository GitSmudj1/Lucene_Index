    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document proposes to adopt a new airworthiness directive (AD) that would apply to certain Piper Aircraft Corporation (Piper) PA28R, PA28RT, and PA44 series airplanes. The proposed action would require installing a certain nose landing gear modification kit. Several service difficulty reports of collapsed nosegear on the affected airplanes prompted this action. In particular, these reports reveal failure of the bolt (AN4-20) connecting the lower drag link of the nosegear to the upper drag link. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent nose gear collapse because of AN4-20 bolt failure, which could lead to airplane damage.</textblock>

Communications should identify the Rules Docket number and be submitted in triplicate to the address specified above. All communications received on or before the closing date for comments, specified above, will be considered before taking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this notice may be changed in light of the comments received.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic, environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submitted will be available, both before and after the closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report that summarizes each FAA-public contact concerned with the substance of this proposal will be filed in the Rules Docket.</textblock>
    <textblock>Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submitted in response to this notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped postcard on which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket No. 94-CE-01-AD.'' The postcard will be date stamped and returned to the commenter.</textblock>
    <textblock>Availability of NPRMs</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Central Region, Office of the Assistant Chief Counsel, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-CE-01-AD, room 1558, 601 E. 12th Street, Kansas City, Missouri 64106.</textblock>
    <textblock>Discussion</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA has received several service difficulty reports of collapsed nosegear on certain Piper PA28R, PA28RT, and PA44 series airplanes. In particular, these reports reveal failure of the bolt (AN4-20) connecting the lower drag link of the nosegear to the upper drag link.</textblock>
    <textblock>For example, the nose landing gear of a Piper Model PA44-180 airplane collapsed during the landing roll. The accident occurred during a normal touchdown and was a result of AN4-20 bolt failure. Both the left and right propellers struck the ground and were damaged beyond repair.</textblock>
    <textblock>Piper Service Letter No. 988, dated July 29, 1986, references Nose Landing Gear Modification Kit, Piper part number (P/N) 764-377 (for PA28R and PA28RT series airplanes) and Piper P/N 764-378 (for PA44 series airplanes). The modification kits consist of a close tolerance bolt (NAS464P4-27), four bearings, and all other associated hardware for installation on the draglink assembly. This NAS464P4-27 bolt replaces the AN4-20 bolt used to connect the upper and lower draglinks. Instructions to these kits specify complete installation procedures for these parts, including a check of the nosegear downlock hook to ensure that it rotates freely.</textblock>
    <textblock>After examining the circumstances and reviewing all available information related to the accident and incidents described above, the FAA has determined that AD action should be taken to prevent nose gear collapse because of failure of the AN4-20 bolt, which could lead to airplane damage.</textblock>
    <textblock>Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop in other Piper PA28R, PA28RT, and PA44 series airplanes of the same type design, the proposed AD would require installing Nose Landing Gear Modification Kit, Piper part number (P/N) 764-377 (for PA28R and PA28RT series airplanes) or Piper P/N 764-378 (for PA44 series airplanes). The proposed action would be accomplished in accordance with the instructions included with the referenced kits.</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA estimates that 6,888 airplanes in the U.S. registry would be affected by the proposed AD, that it would take approximately 6 workhours per airplane to accomplish the proposed action, and that the average labor rate is approximately $55 an hour. Parts cost approximately $52 per airplane. Based on these figures, the total cost impact of the proposed AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $2,631,216. This figure is based on the assumption that none of the affected airplane owners/operators have accomplished the proposed modification.</textblock>
