    <textblock>Commissioner of Customs,</textblock>
    <textblock>Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC 20229.</textblock>
    <textblock>Dear Commissioner: Under the terms of section 204 of the Agricultural Act of 1956, as amended (7 U.S.C. 1854), and the Arrangement Regarding International Trade in Textiles done at Geneva on December 20, 1973, as further extended on December 9, 1993; pursuant to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated February 4, 1994, between the Governments of the United States and the Republic of Hungary; and in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 11651 of March 3, 1972, as amended, you are directed to prohibit, effective on February 25, 1994, entry into the United States for consumption and withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of wool and man-made fiber textile products in the following categories, produced or manufactured in Hungary and exported during the twelve-month period beginning on January 1, 1994 and extending through December 31, 1994, in excess of the following levels of restraint:</textblock>
    <textblock>Imports charged to these category limits for the period January 1, 1993 through December 31, 1993 shall be charged against those levels of restraint to the extent of any unfilled balances. In the event the limits established for that period have been exhausted by previous entries, such goods shall be subject to the levels set forth in this directive.</textblock>
    <textblock>In carrying out the above directions, the Commissioner of Customs should construe entry into the United States for consumption to include entry for consumption into the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</textblock>
