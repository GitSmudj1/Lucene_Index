    <textblock>Review Process</textblock>
    <textblock>USIA will acknowledge receipt of all proposals and will review them for technical eligibility.

Eligible proposals will be forwarded to panels of USIA officers for advisory review. Proposals are reviewed by USIS posts and by USIA's Office of American Republics. Proposals may also be reviewed by the Office of General Counsel or other Agency offices. Funding decisions are at the discretion of the Associate Director for Educational and Cultural Affairs. Final technical authority for grant awards resides with USIA's contracting officer.</textblock>
