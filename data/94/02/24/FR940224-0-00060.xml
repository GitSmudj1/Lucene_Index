    <textblock>The limiting of the fee exemption will not affect those law enforcement analytical laboratories which are described in ยง1301.26.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Deputy Assistant Administrator, Office of Diversion Control, hereby certifies that this final rule will have no significant impact upon entities whose interests must be considered under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any financial or regulatory burdens that practitioners may experience are existing burdens which the practitioners have heretofore avoided by inappropriate use of the fee exemption.</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule is not a significant regulatory action and therefore has not been reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget pursuant to Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteria in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that the final rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</textblock>
