    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>NIST invites interested members of the public to review validation requirements that have been developed for products that implement FIPS PUB 140-1, Security Requirements for Cryptographic Modules. NIST plans to establish a product certification program using independent third party laboratories to validate cryptographic modules for conformance to the security requirements of FIPS 140-1. The requirements for certification will be finalized after the proposed procedures, inspections and tests for conformance have been determined. A National Voluntary Laboratory Accreditation Program will be set up to accredit the third party laboratories at an appropriate future time. At this time, NIST solicits public review of the proposed procedures, inspections, and tests that will be used and the expected results to be achieved in the validation of cryptographic modules.</textblock>
    <textblock>Those wishing to review the validation requirements may obtain a copy from the Standards Processing Coordinator (ADP), National Institute of Standards and Technology, Technology Building, room B64, Gaithersburg, MD 20899, telephone (301) 975-2816.</textblock>
