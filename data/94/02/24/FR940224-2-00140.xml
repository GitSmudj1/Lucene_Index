    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 8, 1993, the President signed the ``North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation</textblock>
    <textblock>Act.'' The Customs modernization portion of this Act (Title VI of Public Law 103-182), popularly known as the Customs Modernization</textblock>
    <textblock>Act or ``Mod Act,'' became effective when it was signed. To</textblock>
    <textblock>provide the public with a general ``Mod Act'' briefing, share ``strawmen'' implementation proposals, and invite informal dialogue relative to implementation plans and issues, Customs will hold an open meeting in Washington on March 8-9, 1994. Between 10 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. on March 8, a general briefing covering operational, automation and enforcement issues will be conducted. This general briefing will be similar to those conducted in Washington on February 9 and 10, 1994. Following the general briefing, senior Customs managers will conduct a series of presentations focussing on their proposals for implementing specific Mod Act provisions. Among the topics to be discussed in these focussed sessions will be regulatory audit, drawback, penalties, carriers, importer activity summary statements and reconciliation. Participants will be given ample opportunity to ask questions and provide suggestions during each session. Persons planning to attend are requested to pre-register by FAX with Mr. Dale Snell at 202-482-6994. Individuals not having access to facsimile equipment may pre-register by calling Mr. Snell at 202-482-6990. To meet Commerce Department building access requirements, attendees are encouraged to arrive approximately 30 minutes in advance of the meeting. Each individual attending Customs Mod Act Implementation meeting on March 8 and 9, 1994, will be required to sign a Commerce Department register and present photo-identification.</textblock>
