    <textblock>Statement of Consideration</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed actions would either terminate, or as an alternative suspend for the months of March through June 1994 and August through November 1994, the seasonal incentive plans for paying producers under the New England and New York-New Jersey Federal milk orders. The seasonal payment plans provide for making deductions from prices paid to producers during the normal flush-production months of March through June. The deducted amounts are returned to producers during the normal short-production months of August through November. The plan is intended to provide an incentive for dairy farmers to level out the seasonal milk production pattern.</textblock>
    <textblock>The actions were requested by several cooperative associations representing dairy farmers who supply handlers regulated by the Federal milk marketing orders for the New England and New York-New Jersey marketing areas. Collectively, these cooperatives represent about 51 percent of the producers associated with the New England marketing area and about 48 percent of the producers associated with the New York-New Jersey marketing area.</textblock>
    <textblock>The cooperatives maintain that the ``Louisville'' seasonal payment plans have not had the effect of reducing the large seasonal spring-to-fall swings in milk production as was intended when they were first provided for in these orders some 25 years ago. They maintain that the seasonality of milk production in the Northeast has not been reduced significantly. The cooperatives assert that the seasonal payment plans are largely ineffective because of a general lack of awareness about the plan in the dairy farming community. They also contend that the price differentials are too low to provide an incentive for dairy farmers to modify their seasonal production patterns. The cooperatives also expressed concern about the impact of reducing returns to producers during the spring months when producer milk prices are already generally lower than during other times of the year.</textblock>
    <textblock>The cooperatives seeking actions noted that the seasonal incentive payment plans have been repeatedly suspended since 1991. They contend that the prior suspension actions are further evidence that the plans are no longer necessary or effective. These past suspensions, according to the cooperatives, were supported by the need for dairy farmers to have additional monies available during the spring months in which prices to producers declined precipitously. The cooperatives expect that milk prices will decline in the spring of 1994, which will continue to put a cash flow pressure on dairy farmers during a time of increased cash needs for spring planting.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, comments are sought to determine whether the aforementioned provisions should be terminated or, in the alternative, suspended for the months of March through June 1994 and August through November 1994.</textblock>
