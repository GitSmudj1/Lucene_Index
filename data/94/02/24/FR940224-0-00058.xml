    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is amending the antibiotic drug regulations to provide for the inclusion of accepted standards for a new antibiotic drug, cefadroxil hemihydrate, and the use of the antibiotic drug in two dosage forms, cefadroxil hemihydrate capsules and cefadroxil hemihydrate tablets. The manufacturer has supplied sufficient data and information to establish its safety and efficacy.</textblock>
  </summary>
  <date>
    <textblock>DATES:</textblock>
    <textblock>Effective March 28, 1994; written comments, notice of participation, and request for a hearing by March 28, 1994; data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing by April 25, 1994.</textblock>

    <textblock>ADDRESSES:</textblock>

    <textblock>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</textblock>
    <textblock>Peter A. Dionne, Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (HFD-520), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857, 301-443-0335.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA has evaluated data submitted in accordance with regulations promulgated under section 507 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 357), as amended, with respect to a request for approval of a new antibiotic drug, cefadroxil hemihydrate, and its use in two dosage forms, cefadroxil hemihydrate capsules and cefadroxil hemihydrate tablets. The agency has concluded that the data supplied by the manufacturer concerning these antibiotic drugs are adequate to establish their safety and efficacy when used as directed in the labeling and that the regulations should be amended in 21 CFR parts 436 and 442 to provide for the inclusion of accepted standards for these products.</textblock>
    <textblock>Environmental Impact</textblock>
    <textblock>The agency has determined under 21 CFR 25.24(c)(6) that this action is of a type that does not individually or cumulatively have a significant effect on the human environment. Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an environmental impact statement is required.</textblock>
    <textblock>Submitting Comments and Filing Objections</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule announces standards that FDA has accepted in a request for approval of an antibiotic drug. Because this final rule is not controversial and because when effective it provides notice of accepted standards, FDA finds that notice and comment procedure is unnecessary and not in the public interest. This final rule, therefore, is effective March 28, 1994. However, interested persons may, on or before March 28, 1994, submit comments to the Dockets Management Branch (address above). Two copies of any comments are to be submitted, except that individuals may submit one copy. Comments are to be identified with the docket number found in brackets in the heading of this document. Received comments may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person who will be adversely affected by this final rule may file objections to it and request a hearing. Reasonable grounds for the hearing must be shown. Any person who decides to seek a hearing must file (1) on or before March 28, 1994, a written notice of participation and request for a hearing, and (2) on or before April 25, 1994, the data, information, and analyses on which the person relies to justify a hearing, as specified in 21 CFR 314.300. A request for a hearing may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. If it conclusively appears from the face of the data, information, and factual analyses in the request for a hearing that no genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the action taken by this order, or if a request for a hearing is not made in the required format or with the required analyses, the Commissioner of Food and Drugs will enter summary judgment against the person(s) who request(s) the hearing, making findings and conclusions and denying a hearing. All submissions must be filed in three copies, identified with the docket number appearing in the heading of this document and filed with the Dockets Management Branch.</textblock>
    <textblock>The procedures and requirements governing this order, a notice of participation and request for a hearing, a submission of data, information, and analyses to justify a hearing, other comments, and grant or denial of a hearing are contained in 21 CFR 314.300.</textblock>
    <textblock>All submissions under this order, except for data and information prohibited from public disclosure under 21 U.S.C. 331(j) or 18 U.S.C. 1905, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.</textblock>
