    <textblock>The amount requested from USIA should not exceed $165,000 for each of these programs. However, organizations with less than four years of successful experience in managing international exchange programs are limited to $60,000.</textblock>
    <textblock>While applicants must provide an all-inclusive budget with the proposal, they are also encouraged to include separate sub-budgets for each program component, phase, location or activity.</textblock>
    <textblock>The recipient's proposal shall include the cost of an audit that:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Complies with the requirements of OMB Circular No. A-133, Audits of Institutions of Higher Education and Other Nonprofit Institutions;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Complies with the requirements of American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) No. 92-9; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Includes review by the recipient's independent auditor of a recipient-prepared supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation, if such a rate is being proposed.</textblock>
    <textblock>The audit costs shall be identified separately for:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Preparation of basic financial statements and other accounting services; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Preparation of the supplemental reports and schedules required by OMB Circular No. A-133, AICPA SOP 92-9, and the review of the supplemental schedule of indirect cost rate computation.</textblock>
    <textblock>USIA will consider funding the following project costs:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. International and domestic air fares; visas; transit costs (e.g., airport taxes); ground transportation costs.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Per diem: For the U.S. program, organizations have the option of using a flat rate of $140/day for international participants or the published Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates for individual American cities.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note:</textblock>
    <textblock>U.S. escorting staff must use the published federal per diem rates, not the flat rate. For activities in the Middle East, North Africa and South Asia, the Standard Federal Travel Regulations per diem rates must be used.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Escort-interpreters: Interpretation for U.S.-based programs is provided by the State Department's Language Services Division. USIA grants do not pay for foreign interpreters to accompany delegations during travel to or from their home country. Grant proposal budgets should contain a flat $140/day per diem rate for each State Department interpreter, as well as home-program-home air transportation of $400 per interpreter and any U.S. travel expenses during the program itself. Salary expenses are covered centrally and are not part of the applicant's budget proposal. For the second component of the program, a limited amount of grant funds would be available for interpreters, should interpretation be required. The grant applicant is encouraged to confirm with the appropriate USIS posts the local costs for interpreters. Grant proposals should reflect these costs.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Book and cultural allowance: Participants are entitled to a one-time cultural allowance of $150 per person, plus a book allowance of $50. Escorts are reimbursed for actual cultural expenses up to $150. U.S. staff do not get these benefits.</textblock>
