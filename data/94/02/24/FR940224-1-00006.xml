    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document invites written comments on a proposal to either terminate or for 1994 suspend the seasonal incentive plans for paying producers under the New England and New York-New Jersey Federal milk orders. This was requested by cooperative associations that represent about one-half of the milk supply for each market. The cooperatives contend that the payment plans, which have been suspended since 1991, are no longer effective in altering producer seasonal milk production patterns.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>(5 U.S.C. 601-612) requires the Agency to examine the impact of a proposed rule on small entities. Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Administrator of the Agricultural Marketing Service has certified that the proposed actions would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Such actions would lessen the regulatory impact of the order on dairy farmers and would have no impact on regulated handlers.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department is issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12778, Civil Justice Reform. This rule is not intended to have a retroactive effect. If adopted, this proposed rule will not preempt any state or local laws, regulations, or policies, unless they present an irreconcilable conflict with this rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended (7 U.S.C. 601-674), provides that administrative proceedings must be exhausted before parties may file suit in court. Under section 608c(15)(A) of the Act, any handler subject to an order may file with the Secretary a petition stating that the order, any provisions of the order, or any obligation imposed in connection with the order is not in accordance with law and request a modification of an order or to be exempted from the order. A handler is afforded the opportunity for a hearing on the petition. After a hearing, the Secretary would rule on the petition. The Act provides that the district court of the United States in any district in which the handler is an inhabitant, or has its principal place of business, has jurisdiction in equity to review the Secretary's ruling on the petition, provided a bill in equity is filed not later than 20 days after the date of the entry of the ruling.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice is hereby given that, pursuant to the provisions of the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act, the termination, or as an alternative the suspension for the months of March through June 1994 and August through November 1994, of the following provisions of the order regulating the handling of milk in the New England and New York-New Jersey marketing areas are being considered:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. In ยง1001.62, paragraphs (c) and (d).</textblock>
    <textblock>2. In ยง1002.61, paragraphs (d) and (e).</textblock>
    <textblock>All persons who want to send written data, views, or arguments about the proposed termination or suspension of provisions should send two copies of them to the USDA/AMS/Dairy Division, Order Formulation Branch, room 2971, South Building, P.O. Box 96456, Washington, DC 20090-6456, not later than 30 days after the publication of this notice in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. The period for filing comments is limited to 15 days because a longer period would not provide the time needed to complete the required procedures before the requested termination or suspension is to be effective.</textblock>
    <textblock>The comments that are received will be made available for public inspection in the Dairy Division during normal business hours (7 CFR 1.27(b)).</textblock>
