    <textblock>The Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS) is reannouncing the following grant program:</textblock>
    <textblock>Grants for Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbance</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the authority of section 561 of the Public Health Service Act, as amended by Public Law 102-321, the CMHS will accept applications from States, political subdivisions of States, and Indian tribes for the purpose of providing comprehensive community mental health services for children and adolescents with serious emotional disturbance. The grants will be used to support a broad array of community-based and family-focused services for children and adolescents with serious emotional, behavioral, or mental disorders to enable communities to develop coordinated local systems of care which involve mental health, child welfare, education, juvenile justice and other agencies, as appropriate. Approximately $10-15 million will be available to support approximately 10-15 grants in FY 1994. The receipt date for applications for FY 1994 funds is May 10, 1994. The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number for this program is</textblock>

    <textblock>The Comprehensive Community Mental Health Services for Children and Adolescents with Serious Emotional Disturbance program was originally announced on April 15, 1993 (</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>, Vol. 58, No. 71) and FY 1993 grant awards were made in September 1993. This program has subsequently been updated to: (1) Provide further clarification of the definition of a community; (2) provide additional specifications on the services that a grantee must provide in developing the system of care; (3) clarify that Indian tribal applicants receiving grants under Section 103 of P.L. 93-638 are exempt from the restriction which prohibits the use of Federal funds as a match; (4) provide greater explanation/clarification of the review criteria; and (5) incorporate other minor technical changes related to individual contacts and addresses, and to help ensure overall clarity.</textblock>
