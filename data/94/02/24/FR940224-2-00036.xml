    <textblock>By order issued May 5, 1993, in Docket No. CP93-41-000, KNI became the successor to the jurisdictional operations of K N Energy, Inc., which in turn had previously succeeded to the operations of Kansas-Nebraska Natural Gas Company, Inc. To avoid confusion, KNI, the current jurisdictional entity, rather than whichever corporate entity existed at the time, will be referred to as the jurisdictional entity.</textblock>
