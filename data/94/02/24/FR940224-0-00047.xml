    <textblock>Outline of ``CTP'' Calculation Method</textblock>
    <textblock>``CTP'' is a measure of computational performance given in millions of theoretical operations per second (Mtops). In calculating the ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') of an aggregation of ``Computing Elements'' (``CEs''), the following three steps are required:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Calculate the effective calculating rate (R) for</textblock>
    <textblock>each ``computing element'' (``CE'');</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Apply the word length adjustment (L) to the effective calculating rate (R), resulting in a Theoretical Performance (TP) for each ``computing element'' (``CE'');</textblock>
    <textblock>3. If there is more than one ``computing element'' (``CE''), combine the Theoretical Performances (TPs), resulting in a ``Composite Theoretical Performance'' (``CTP'') for the aggregation.</textblock>
    <textblock>Details for these steps are given in the following section.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note 1:</textblock>
    <textblock>For aggregations of multiple ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') that have both shared and unshared memory subsystems, the calculation of ``CTP'' is completed hierarchically, in two steps: first, aggregate the groups of ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') sharing memory; second calculate the ``CTP'' of the groups using the calculation method for multiple ``computing elements'' (``CEs'') not sharing memory.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note 2:</textblock>
    <textblock>``Computing elements'' (``CEs'') that are limited to input/output and peripheral functions (e.g., disk drive, communication and video display controllers) are not aggregated into the ``CTP'' calculation.</textblock>
