    <textblock>The meetings are a follow-up to similar meetings conducted by the BIA since 1990. The purpose of the consultation, as required by 25 U.S.C. 2010(b), is to provide Indian tribes, school boards, parents, Indian organizations and other interested parties with an opportunity to comment on potential issues raised during previous consultation meetings or being considered by the BIA regarding Indian education programs. A consultation booklet for the March meetings is being distributed to Federally recognized Indian Tribes, Bureau Area and Agency Offices and Bureau-funded schools. The booklets will also be available from local contact persons and at each meeting.</textblock>
