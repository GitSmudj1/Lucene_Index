    <textblock>The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this action (1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draft regulatory evaluation prepared for this action has been placed in the Rules Docket. A copy of it may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket at the location provided under the caption ADDRESSES</textblock>

    <textblock>The Proposed Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:</textblock>

    <textblock>49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.</textblock>
    <textblock>§39.13</textblock>
    <textblock>[Amended]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 39.13 is amended by adding the following new AD:</textblock>
    <textblock>Piper Aircraft Corporation:</textblock>
    <textblock>Docket No. 94-CE-01-AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability:</textblock>
    <textblock>The following model and serial number airplanes, certificated in any category:</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance:</textblock>
    <textblock>Required within the next 100 hours time-in-service after the effective date of this AD, unless already accomplished.</textblock>
    <textblock>To prevent nose gear collapse, which could lead to airplane damage, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Incorporate Nose Landing Gear Modification Kit, Piper part number (P/N) 764-377 (for PA28R and PA28RT series airplanes) or Piper P/N 764-378 (for PA44 series airplanes). Accomplish this action in accordance with the procedures and sketches included with the instructions to the above referenced kits.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note 1:</textblock>
    <textblock>The modification kits referenced in paragraph (a) of this AD consist of a close tolerance bolt (NAS464P4-27), four bearings, and all other associated hardware for installation on the draglink assembly. This NAS464P4-27 bolt replaces the AN4-20 bolt used to connect the upper and lower draglinks.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with 14 CFR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an equivalent level of safety may be approved by the Manager, Atlanta Aircraft Certification Office (ACO), 1669 Phoenix Parkway, Suite 210C, Atlanta, Georgia 30349. The request shall be forwarded through an appropriate FAA Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Atlanta ACO.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note 2:</textblock>
