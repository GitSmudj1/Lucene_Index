    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) is proposing to amend its loan guaranty regulations to comply with certain provisions of the Veterans Home Loan Program Amendments of 1992 and the Onmibus Budget Reconciliatory Act of 1993. VA proposes to amend its regulations to provide for the guarantee of loans for reservists and members of the national guard, loans where the interest rate has been negotiated between the borrower and the lender, adjustable rate mortgages, and energy efficient mortgages. VA also proposes to amend its regulations to reflect a reduced funding fee for interest rate reduction refinancing loans, and a revised guaranty percentage for these loans as well as an increased funding fee on most guaranteed loans, and an increased funding fee for second and subsequent use of the loan guaranty benefit, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans. These changes will increase the types of loans available to veterans and the categories of veterans eligible for VA home loans.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>VA is proposing to incorporate into its regulations several changes to comply with certain provisions of Public Law 102-547 and Public Law 103-66.</textblock>
    <textblock>Prior to the enactment of Public Law 102-547 persons whose only military service consisted of active duty for training and inactive duty training in the reserve components of the Armed Forces did not qualify for loan guaranty benefits. Public Law 102-547 extends eligibility for VA-guaranteed home loans to certain members of the Selected Reserve as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5). This eligibility expires 7 years from the date of enactment of the law.</textblock>
    <textblock>38 U.S.C. 3729 requires that a funding fee be collected from each veteran obtaining a VA-guaranteed loan except for veterans who receive compensation or from a surviving spouse of a veteran who died from a service-connected disability. Public Law 102-547 requires that a higher funding fee be collected on loans to the newly eligible members of the Selected Reserve as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5) than on loans to other veterans. Effective October 1, 1993, Public Law 103-66, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, increased the funding fee by 0.75 percent on all VA loans except interest rate reduction refinancing loans, vendee loans, direct loans, manufactured home loans under 38 U.S.C. 3712, and loan assumptions. This new law also established an increased fee for second and subsequent use of the loan guaranty benefit, except for interest rate reduction refinancing loans. The increase in funding fees established by Public Law 103-66 will expire on September 30, 1998. VA is proposing to amend 38 CFR 36.4312 to add the funding fee structure for members of the Selected Reserves, and to provide for the higher funding fees required by Public Law 103-66, as discussed in the following paragraphs.</textblock>
    <textblock>Public Law 103-66 provides that on loans to veterans whose entitlement is not based on service in the Selected Reserve as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3701 (b)(5)(1), the funding fee shall be as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) For loans for the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, the funding fee shall be 2.00 percent of the total loan amount;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) For loans where the veteran makes a down payment of 5 percent or more, but less than 10 percent, the funding fee shall be 1.5 percent of the loan amount;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) For loans where the veteran makes a down payment of 10 percent or more, the funding fee shall be 1.25 percent of the total loan amount;</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) For refinancing loans except interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) and 3710(b)(7), the funding fee shall be 2.00 percent of the total loan amount; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) For loans where the veteran uses entitlement for a second or subsequent time and does not make a downpayment, the funding fee shall be 3.00 percent of the total loan amount.</textblock>
    <textblock>Public Law 103-66 provides that on loans to veterans whose entitlement is based on service in the Selected Reserve as defined in 38 U.S.C. 3701(b)(5) the funding fee shall be as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) For loans for the purchase or construction of a home on which the veteran does not make a down payment, the funding fee shall be 2.75 percent of the total loan amount;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) For loans where the veteran makes a down payment of 5 percent or more, but less than 10 percent, the funding fee shall be 2.25 percent of the loan amount;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) For loans where the veteran makes a down payment of 10 percent or more, the funding fee shall be 2.00 percent of the total loan amount;</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) For refinancing loans except interest rate reduction refinancing loans under 38 U.S.C. 3710(a)(8) and 3710(b)(7), the funding fee shall be 2.75 percent of the total loan amount; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) For loans where the veteran uses entitlement for a second or subsequent time and does not make a downpayment, the funding fee shall be 3.00 percent of the total loan amount.</textblock>
    <textblock>Prior to the enactment of Public Law 102-547 the Secretary was required to set a maximum interest rate which a veteran could pay when purchasing a home with a VA guaranteed loan, and the veteran was not permitted to pay discount points on the loan. Public Law 102-547 authorizes the Secretary to elect either to require that VA-guaranteed loans bear interest at rates not to exceed the maximum rates established by the Secretary or to allow such loans to bear interest at rates agreed upon by the veteran and the lender. The law also authorizes the Secretary to change the election from time to time, and provides that when the Secretary has elected to have interest rates negotiated between the veteran and the lender, the veteran may pay reasonable discount points on the loan. Effective October 28, 1992, the Secretary elected to have interest rates negotiated between the veteran and the lender. VA proposes to amend 38 CFR 36.4212 and 36.4311 to reflect these changes.</textblock>
