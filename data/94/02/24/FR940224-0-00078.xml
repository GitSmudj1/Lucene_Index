    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>NMFS issues a technical amendment to the 1994 Pacific cod specifications authorized under Amendment 24 to the Fishery Management Plan (FMP) for the Groundfish Fishery of the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Area (BSAI) and published with the final rule implementing this amendment. This technical amendment is necessary to clarify a table that sets forth the 1994 seasonal apportionments of the amount of Pacific cod total allowable catch (TAC) allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear. It is intended to promote management and conservation of groundfish and other fish resources and to further the goals and objectives contained in the FMP.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The final rule implementing Amendment 24 to the FMP for the Groundfish Fishery of the BSAI also specified 1994 seasonal apportionments of the amount of the 1994 Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear (59 FR 4009, January 28, 1994). These specifications were established in Table 2 of the preamble to the final rule at</textblock>
    <textblock>59 FR 4011. This technical amendment clarifies Table 2 by adding a footnote that sets forth the intent of the North Pacific Fishery Management Council to redistribute any unused portions of the first seasonal apportionment to the third season. This intent is set forth in the preamble to the proposed rule published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on October 27, 1993</textblock>
    <textblock>(58 FR 57803) but inadvertently omitted in the final rule of January 28, 1994 (59 FR 4009). (See page 57805 in the first column in the first paragraph.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Classification</textblock>
    <textblock>Because this technical amendment makes only minor, non-substantive changes to existing regulations, notice and public comment thereon and a delay in the effective date would serve no purpose. This rule clarifies the intent of the Council with respect to the seasonal apportionments of the amount of the 1994 Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using hook-and-line or pot gear.</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule is not subject to review under E.O. 12866.</textblock>

    <textblock>Technical Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, the final rule published at 59 FR 4009,</textblock>
    <textblock>January 28, 1994, that specifies the 1994 seasonal allowances of the amount of Pacific cod TAC allocated to vessels using</textblock>
    <textblock>hook-and-line or pot gear is amended by revising Table 2 in the preamble on page 4011 to include a footnote, as follows:</textblock>
