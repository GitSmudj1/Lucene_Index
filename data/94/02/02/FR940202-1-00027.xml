    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(c)</textblock>
    <textblock>Obtaining other information.</textblock>
    <textblock>Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, the agency must, for the purpose of implementing the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii) and (d)(4)(i) of this section, incorporate into the eligibility case file the names and SSNs of absent or custodial parents of Medicaid recipients to the extent such information is available.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d)</textblock>
    <textblock>Exchange of data.</textblock>
    <textblock>Except as provided in paragraph (l) of this section, to obtain and use information for the purpose of determining the legal liability of the third parties so that the agency may process claims under the third party liability payment procedures specified in §433.139(b) through (f), the agency must take the following actions:</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(e)</textblock>
    <textblock>Diagnosis and trauma code edits.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Except as specified under paragraph (e)(2) or (l) of this section, or both, the agency must take action to identify those paid claims for Medicaid recipients that contain diagnosis codes 800 through 999 International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, Volume 1 (ICD-9-CM) inclusive, for the purpose of determining the legal liability of third parties so that the agency may process claims under the third party liability payment procedures specified in §433.139(b) through (f).</textblock>

    <textblock>The agency must provide such reports with respect to the data exchanges and trauma code edits set forth in paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(4) and paragraph (e) of this section, respectively, as the Secretary prescribes for the purpose of determining compliance under §433.138 and evaluating the effectiveness of the third party liability identification system.

    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(l)</textblock>

    <textblock>(i) The agency must submit a request for waiver of the requirement in writing to the HCFA regional office.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) The request must contain adequate documentation to establish that to meet a requirement specified by the agency is not cost-effective. Examples of documentation are claims recovery data and a State analysis documenting a cost-effective alternative that accomplished the same task.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) The agency must agree, if a waiver is granted, to notify HCFA of any event that occurs that changes the conditions upon which the waiver was approved.</textblock>
