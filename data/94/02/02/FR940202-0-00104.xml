  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The ICC is issuing final rules permitting carriers to effectuate range tariffs by filing by fax the actual rates applicable to identified shipments prior to transport of those shipments. Section 5(b) of the Negotiated Rates Act of 1993 requires that, as of June 1, 1994, range tariffs must identify the specific rate or discount (from among the range of available rates or discounts) which applies to each specific shipment, or must contain an objective means for determining that rate. Faxed rates, which are intended for use only where carriers must respond rapidly to changing market demands in the spot market, will have an effective period of only 7 days.</textblock>
  </summary>
  <date>
    <textblock>EFFECTIVE DATE:</textblock>
    <textblock>These regulations are effective on March 4, 1994, and carriers may begin to use the fax filing process for spot market shipments on that date.</textblock>

    <textblock>Regulatory Flexibility Certification</textblock>
    <textblock>No one has challenged our initial conclusion that this action will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. We reaffirm this conclusion for the reasons previously cited, i.e., that the economic impact will be minimal because the regulation merely provides for another means by which carriers may submit to the agency certain materials already required by statute to be filed with the agency. Thus, the economic impact is unlikely to be significant within the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>Environmental Statement</textblock>
    <textblock>This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the human environment or the conservation of energy resources.</textblock>
