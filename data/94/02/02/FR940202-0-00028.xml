    <textblock>The transactional penalty</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Substantial valuation</textblock>
    <textblock>misstatement.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the case of any transaction between related</textblock>
    <textblock>persons, there is a substantial valuation misstatement if the</textblock>
    <textblock>price for any property or services (or for the use of property)</textblock>
    <textblock>claimed on any return is 200 percent or more (or 50 percent or</textblock>
    <textblock>less) of the amount determined under section 482 to be the</textblock>
    <textblock>correct price.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Gross valuation misstatement.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the case of any</textblock>
    <textblock>transaction between related persons, there is a gross valuation</textblock>
    <textblock>misstatement if the price for any property or services (or for</textblock>
    <textblock>the use of property) claimed on any return is 400 percent or more</textblock>
    <textblock>(or 25 percent or less) of the amount determined under section</textblock>
    <textblock>482 to be the correct price.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Reasonable cause and good faith.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to section</textblock>
    <textblock>6664(c), the transactional penalty will not be imposed on any</textblock>
    <textblock>portion of an underpayment with respect to which the requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>of ยง1.6664-4 are met. A taxpayer that meets the requirements of</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph (d) of this section with respect to an allocation under</textblock>
    <textblock>section 482 will be treated as having established that there was</textblock>
    <textblock>reasonable cause and good faith with respect to that item for</textblock>
    <textblock>purposes of ยง1.6664-4. If a substantial or gross valuation</textblock>
    <textblock>misstatement under the transactional penalty also constitutes (or</textblock>
    <textblock>is part of) a substantial or gross valuation misstatement under</textblock>
    <textblock>the net adjustment penalty, then the rules of section (d) (and</textblock>
    <textblock>not the rules of ยง1.6664-4) will be applied to determine whether</textblock>
    <textblock>the adjustment is excluded from calculation of the net section</textblock>
    <textblock>482 adjustment.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c)</textblock>
    <textblock>Net adjustment penalty</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Net section 482</textblock>
    <textblock>adjustment.</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of this section, the term net section</textblock>
    <textblock>482 adjustment means the sum of all increases in the taxable</textblock>
    <textblock>income of a taxpayer for a taxable year resulting from</textblock>
    <textblock>allocations under section 482 (determined without regard to any</textblock>
    <textblock>amount carried to such taxable year from another taxable year)</textblock>
    <textblock>less any decreases in taxable income attributable to collateral</textblock>
    <textblock>adjustments as described in ยง1.482-1T(e). For purposes of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section, amounts that meet the requirements of paragraph (d) of</textblock>
    <textblock>this section will be excluded from the calculation of the net</textblock>
    <textblock>section 482 adjustment. Substantial and gross valuation</textblock>
    <textblock>misstatements that are subject to the transactional penalty under</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraphs (b) (1) or (2) are included in determining the amount</textblock>
    <textblock>of the net section 482 adjustment. See paragraph (f) of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section for coordination rules between penalties.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Substantial valuation misstatement.</textblock>
    <textblock>There is a</textblock>
    <textblock>substantial valuation misstatement if a net section 482</textblock>
    <textblock>adjustment is greater than the lesser of 5 million dollars or ten</textblock>
    <textblock>percent of gross receipts.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Gross valuation misstatement.</textblock>
    <textblock>There is a gross</textblock>
    <textblock>valuation misstatement if a net section 482 adjustment is greater</textblock>
    <textblock>than the lesser of 20 million dollars or twenty percent of gross</textblock>
    <textblock>receipts.</textblock>
