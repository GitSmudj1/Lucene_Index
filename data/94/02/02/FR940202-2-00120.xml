    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>a. If there is no evidence of continued nosocomial transmission, continue the intensive prospective surveillance (as in II-B-3, above) for at least 2 months after surveillance was begun.</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY II</textblock>
    <textblock>b. If there is evidence of continued transmission:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Conduct an environmental investigation to determine the source(s) of</textblock>
    <textblock>Legionella</textblock>
    <textblock>sp. by collecting water samples from potential sources of aerosolized water, following the methods described in Appendix C and saving and subtyping isolates of</textblock>
    <textblock>Legionella</textblock>
    <textblock>spp. obtained from patients and environment.</textblock>
    <textblock>227,375-382,404,406</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) If a source is not identified, continue surveillance for new cases for at least 2 months, and, depending on the scope of the outbreak, decide on either deferring decontamination pending identification of the source(s) of</textblock>
    <textblock>Legionella</textblock>
    <textblock>spp., or proceeding with decontamination of the hospital's water distribution system, with special attention to the specific hospital areas involved in the outbreak.</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY II</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) If a source of infection is identified by epidemiologic and environmental investigation, promptly decontaminate it.</textblock>
    <textblock>417</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) If the heated-water system is implicated:</textblock>
    <textblock>i. Decontaminate the heated-water system either by superheating (flushing for at least 5 minutes each distal outlet of the system with water at "65</textblock>
    <textblock>○C), OR by hyperchlorination (flushing for at least 5 minutes all outlets of the system with water containing "10 mg/L free residual chlorine).</textblock>
    <textblock>403,408-410</textblock>
    <textblock>Post warning signs at each outlet being flushed to prevent scald injury to patients, staff, or visitors.</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>ii. Depending on local and state regulations regarding potable-water temperature in public buildings, maintain potable water at the outlet at "50</textblock>
    <textblock>○C or &lt;20</textblock>
    <textblock>○C, or chlorinate heated water to achieve 1-2 mg/L free residual chlorine at the tap in hospitals housing patients who are at high risk of acquiring nosocomial legionellosis (e.g., immunocompromised patients).</textblock>
    <textblock>338,383,393,400-403</textblock>
    <textblock>(See appendix B.)</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY II</textblock>
    <textblock>iii. NO RECOMMENDATION for treatment of water with ozone, ultraviolet light, or heavy-metal ions.</textblock>
    <textblock>344,411,412,414</textblock>
    <textblock>UNRESOLVED ISSUE</textblock>
    <textblock>iv. Clean hot-water storage tanks and water-heaters to remove accumulated scale and sediment.</textblock>
    <textblock>346</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>v. Restrict immunocompromised patients from taking showers, and use only sterile water for their oral consumption until</textblock>
    <textblock>Legionella</textblock>
    <textblock>spp. becomes undetectable by culture in the hospital water.</textblock>
    <textblock>384</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY II</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) If cooling towers or evaporative condensers are implicated, decontaminate the cooling-tower system using the protocol outlined in Appendix D.</textblock>
    <textblock>415</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Assess the efficacy of implemented measures in reducing or eliminating</textblock>
    <textblock>Legionella</textblock>
    <textblock>spp. by collecting specimens for culture at 2-week intervals for 3 months.</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY II</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) If</textblock>
    <textblock>Legionella</textblock>
    <textblock>sp. is not detected in cultures during 3 months of monitoring, collect cultures monthly for another 3 months.</textblock>
