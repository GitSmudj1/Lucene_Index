    <textblock>Adoption of the Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration amends 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:</textblock>

    <textblock>49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง39.13</textblock>
    <textblock>[Amended]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39-7095 (56 FR 37462, August 7, 1991), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), amendment 39-8794, to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>94-01-12 Airbus Industrie:</textblock>
    <textblock>Amendment 39-8794. Docket 93-NM-120-AD. Supersedes AD 91-17-05, Amendment 39-7095.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability:</textblock>
    <textblock>All Model A310-200 and A310-300 series airplanes, certificated in any category.</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance:</textblock>
    <textblock>Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.</textblock>
    <textblock>To prevent rupture of the flap universal joints, subsequent partial loss of lift in one wing, and reduced controllability of the airplane, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Prior to the accumulation of 5,500 total landings, or within 350 hours time-in-service after September 11, 1991 (the effective date of AD 91-16-05, Amendment 39-7095), whichever occurs later, and thereafter at intervals not to exceed 3,500 landings, perform repetitive visual inspections and electrical continuity tests of the flap system.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) If any universal joint bushes are missing or broken, prior to further flight, replace the bushes with new bushes in accordance with Airbus Industrie Service Bulletin A310-27-2054, Revision 2, dated November 9, 1990. After replacement, repeat the inspections required by paragraph (a) of this AD at intervals not to exceed 3,500 landings.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Within 3,500 landings after the effective date of this AD, modify the flap universal joint assemblies (Airbus Industrie Modification 10091D20285) in accordance with Airbus Industrie Service Bulletin A310-27-2059, dated March 1, 1993. Accomplishment of this modification constitutes terminating action for the inspection and test requirements of this AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Modification of the flap universal joint assemblies (Airbus Industrie Modification 10091D20285) in accordance with Airbus Industrie Service Bulletin A310-27-2059, dated March 1, 1993, constitutes terminating action for the inspection and test requirements of this AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e) An alternative method of compliance or adjustment of the compliance time that provides an acceptable level of safety may be used if approved by the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113, FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate. Operators shall submit their requests through an appropriate FAA Principal Maintenance Inspector, who may add comments and then send it to the Manager, Standardization Branch, ANM-113.</textblock>
    <textblock>Note:</textblock>
    <textblock>Information concerning the existence of approved alternative methods of compliance with this AD, if any, may be obtained from the Standardization Branch, ANM-113.</textblock>
    <textblock>(f) Special flight permits may be issued in accordance with FAR 21.197 and 21.199 to operate the airplane to a location where the requirements of this AD can be accomplished.</textblock>
    <textblock>(g) The inspections, testing, and replacement shall be done in accordance with Airbus Industrie Service Bulletin A310-27-2054, Revision 2, dated November 9, 1990. The incorporation by reference of this document was approved previously by the Director of the Federal Register, in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51, as of September 11, 1991 (56 FR 37462, August 7, 1991).
