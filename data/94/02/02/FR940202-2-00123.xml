    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>a. Collect environmental samples from potential sources of</textblock>
    <textblock>Aspergillus</textblock>
    <textblock>spp., especially those sources implicated in the epidemiologic investigation, by using appropriate methods,424,427,428,472,484,488,666</textblock>
    <textblock>e.g., use of a high-volume air sampler rather than settle plates.</textblock>
    <textblock>424</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>b. Perform molecular subtyping of</textblock>
    <textblock>Aspergillus</textblock>
    <textblock>spp. obtained from patients and the environment to establish strain identity.</textblock>
    <textblock>476,477</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>c. If air-handling systems supplying high-risk patient-care areas are not optimal, consider temporary deployment of portable HEPA filters until rooms with optimal air-handling systems are available for all patients at high risk of invasive aspergillosis.469</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY II</textblock>
    <textblock>d. If an environmental source is identified, perform corrective measures as needed to eliminate the source from the high-risk patients' environment.</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>e. If an environmental source is not identified, review existing infection-control measures, including engineering aspects, to identify potential areas that can be corrected or improved.</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Modifying Host Risk for Infection</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Administer cytokines, including granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and granulocyte-macrophage stimulating factor, to increase host resistance to aspergillosis by decreasing the duration and severity of chemotherapy-induced granulocytopenia.</textblock>
    <textblock>464,465</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY II</textblock>
    <textblock>B. NO RECOMMENDATION for administration of intranasal amphotericin B or oral antifungal agents (including amphotericin B and triazole compounds) in high-risk patients for prophylaxis against aspergillosis.466,467,667</textblock>
    <textblock>UNRESOLVED ISSUE</textblock>
    <textblock>Prevention and Control of Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection</textblock>
    <textblock>(The principles and recommendations below are applicable for prevention and control of nosocomial</textblock>
    <textblock>lower respiratory tract infections due to adenovirus, parainfluenza virus and rhinovirus.)</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Staff Education and Infection Surveillance</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Staff Education</textblock>
    <textblock>Educate personnel about the epidemiology, modes of transmission and means of preventing spread of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).215,611-613</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IA</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Surveillance</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Establish mechanism(s) by which the appropriate hospital personnel are promptly alerted to any increase in RSV activity in the local community.</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>2. During periods of increased prevalence of RSV in the community (and during December-March), attempt prompt diagnosis of RSV infection by using rapid diagnostic techniques as clinically indicated in pediatric patients, especially infants, and in immunocompromised adults admitted to the hospital with respiratory illness.545,549</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Interruption of Transmission of RSV</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Prevention of Person-to-Person Transmission</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Primary Measures for Contact Isolation</textblock>
    <textblock>a.</textblock>
    <textblock>Handwashing.</textblock>
    <textblock>Wash hands after contact with a patient, or after touching respiratory secretions or fomites potentially contaminated with respiratory secretions, whether or not gloves are worn.207,503,524-526,547</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IA</textblock>
    <textblock>b.</textblock>
    <textblock>Gloving.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Wear gloves for handling patients or respiratory secretions of patients with proven or suspected RSV infection, or fomites potentially contaminated with patient secretions.215,503,524,525,543,549</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IA</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Change gloves between patients, or after handling respiratory secretions or fomites contaminated with secretions from one patient before contact with another patient.215,217</textblock>
    <textblock>Wash hands after removing gloves. (See II-A-1-a, above.)</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IA</textblock>
    <textblock>c.</textblock>
    <textblock>Gowning.</textblock>
    <textblock>Wear a gown when soiling with respiratory secretions from a patient is anticipated, e.g., when handling infants with RSV infection or other viral respiratory illness, and change the gown after such contact and before caring for another patient.</textblock>
    <textblock>215,542,544,549</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>d.</textblock>
    <textblock>Staffing.</textblock>
    <textblock>Restrict healthcare workers in the acute stages of an upper respiratory illness, i.e., those who are sneezing and/or coughing, from taking care of RSV-uninfected infants and other patients at high risk for complications from RSV infection, e.g., children with severe underlying cardio-pulmonary conditions, children receiving chemotherapy for malignancy, and patients who are otherwise immunocompromised.547,549</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>e.</textblock>
    <textblock>Limiting Visitors.</textblock>
    <textblock>Do not allow persons with symptoms of respiratory infection to visit uninfected pediatric, immunosuppressed, and cardiac patients.543</textblock>
