    <textblock>§1.1271-1</textblock>
    <textblock>Special rules applicable to amounts received on</textblock>
    <textblock>retirement, sale, or exchange of debt instruments.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>Intention to call before maturity</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>In general</textblock>
    <textblock>. For</textblock>
    <textblock>purposes of section 1271(a)(2), all or a portion of gain realized</textblock>
    <textblock>on a sale or exchange of a debt instrument to which section 1271</textblock>
    <textblock>applies is treated as interest income if there was an intention</textblock>
    <textblock>to call the debt instrument before maturity. An intention to</textblock>
    <textblock>call a debt instrument before maturity means a written or oral</textblock>
    <textblock>agreement or understanding not provided for in the debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument between the issuer and the original holder of the debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument that the issuer will redeem the debt instrument before</textblock>
    <textblock>maturity. In the case of debt instruments that are part of an</textblock>
    <textblock>issue, the agreement or understanding must be between the issuer</textblock>
    <textblock>and the original holders of a substantial amount of the debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instruments in the issue. An intention to call before maturity</textblock>
    <textblock>can exist even if the intention is conditional (e.g., the</textblock>
    <textblock>issuer's decision to call depends on the financial condition of</textblock>
    <textblock>the issuer on the potential call date) or is not legally binding.</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of this section, original holder means the first</textblock>
    <textblock>holder (other than an underwriter or dealer that purchased the</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument for resale in the ordinary course of its trade or</textblock>
    <textblock>business).</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Exceptions</textblock>
    <textblock>. In addition to the exceptions provided in</textblock>
    <textblock>sections 1271(a)(2)(B) and 1271(b), section 1271(a)(2) does not</textblock>
    <textblock>apply to_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) A debt instrument that is publicly offered (as defined</textblock>
    <textblock>in §1.1275-1(h));</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) A debt instrument to which section 1272(a)(6) applies</textblock>
    <textblock>(relating to certain interests in or mortgages held by a REMIC,</textblock>
    <textblock>and certain other debt instruments with payments subject to</textblock>
    <textblock>acceleration); or</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) A debt instrument sold pursuant to a private placement</textblock>
    <textblock>memorandum that is distributed to more than ten offerees and that</textblock>
    <textblock>is subject to the sanctions of section 12(2) of the Securities</textblock>
    <textblock>Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. 77l) or the prohibitions of section 10(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78j).</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Short-term obligations</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>In general</textblock>
    <textblock>. Under sections</textblock>
    <textblock>1271(a)(3) and (a)(4), all or a portion of the gain realized on</textblock>
    <textblock>the sale or exchange of a short-term government or nongovernment</textblock>
    <textblock>obligation is treated as interest income. Sections 1271(a)(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>and (a)(4), however, do not apply to any short-term obligation</textblock>
    <textblock>subject to section 1281. See §1.1272-1(f) for rules to</textblock>
    <textblock>determine if an obligation is a short-term obligation.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Method of making elections</textblock>
    <textblock>. Elections to accrue on a</textblock>
    <textblock>constant yield basis under sections 1271(a)(3)(E) and (a)(4)(D)</textblock>
    <textblock>are made on an obligation-by-obligation basis by reporting the</textblock>
    <textblock>transaction on the basis of daily compounding on the taxpayer's</textblock>
    <textblock>timely filed Federal income tax return for the year of the sale</textblock>
    <textblock>or exchange. These elections are irrevocable.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Counting conventions</textblock>
    <textblock>. In computing the ratable share of</textblock>
    <textblock>acquisition discount under section 1271(a)(3) or OID under</textblock>
    <textblock>section 1271(a)(4), any reasonable counting convention may be</textblock>
    <textblock>used (e.g., 30 days per month/360 days per year).</textblock>
    <textblock>§1.1272-1</textblock>
    <textblock>Current inclusion of OID in income.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>Overview</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>In general</textblock>
    <textblock>. Under section 1272(a)(1), a</textblock>
    <textblock>holder of a debt instrument includes accrued OID in gross income</textblock>
    <textblock>(as interest), regardless of the holder's regular method of</textblock>
    <textblock>accounting. A holder includes qualified stated interest (as</textblock>
    <textblock>defined in §1.1273-1(c)) in income under the holder's regular</textblock>
    <textblock>method of accounting. See §§1.446-2 and 1.451-1.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Debt instruments not subject to OID inclusion rules.</textblock>
    <textblock>Sections 1272(a)(2) and 1272(c) list exceptions to the general</textblock>
    <textblock>inclusion rule of section 1272(a)(1). For purposes of section</textblock>
    <textblock>1272(a)(2)(E) (relating to certain loans between natural</textblock>
    <textblock>persons), a loan does not include a stripped bond or stripped</textblock>
    <textblock>coupon within the meaning of section 1286(e), and the rule in</textblock>
    <textblock>section 1272(a)(2)(E)(iii), which treats a husband and wife as 1</textblock>
    <textblock>person, does not apply to loans made between a husband and wife.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Accrual of OID</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Constant yield method</textblock>
    <textblock>. Except as</textblock>
    <textblock>provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and (b)(3) of this section, the</textblock>
    <textblock>amount of OID includible in the income of a holder of a debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument for any taxable year is determined using the constant</textblock>
    <textblock>yield method as described under this paragraph (b)(1).</textblock>
    <textblock>(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>Step one: Determine the debt instrument's yield to</textblock>
    <textblock>maturity.</textblock>
    <textblock>The yield to maturity or yield of a debt instrument is</textblock>
    <textblock>the discount rate that, when used in computing the present value</textblock>
    <textblock>of all principal and interest payments to be made under the debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument, produces an amount equal to the issue price of the</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument. The yield must be constant over the term of the</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument and, when expressed as a percentage, must be</textblock>
    <textblock>calculated to at least two decimal places. See paragraph (c) of</textblock>
    <textblock>this section for rules relating to the yield of certain debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instruments subject to contingencies.</textblock>
