    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A320 series airplanes, that currently requires modification of the belly fairing structure. This action would revise the compliance time for accomplishment of the modification. All other parts of the rule would remain unchanged. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to ensure that the structural integrity of the belly fairing structure is maintained.</textblock>

    <textblock>Availability of NPRMs</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person may obtain a copy of this NPRM by submitting a request to the FAA, Transport Airplane Directorate, ANM-103, Attention: Rules Docket No. 94-NM-08-AD, 1601 Lind Avenue SW., Renton, Washington 98055-4056.</textblock>
    <textblock>Discussion</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 6, 1993, the FAA issued AD 93-24-11, Amendment 39-8760</textblock>
    <textblock>(58 FR 64875, December 10, 1993), applicable to certain Airbus Industrie Model A320 series airplanes, to require modification of the belly fairing structure. That action was prompted by results of fatigue testing, which revealed that rivet heads were sheared off and fatigue cracks were present in the angles at the angle attachment between the keelbeam and the belly fairing support frames. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent reduced structural integrity of the belly fairing structure.</textblock>
    <textblock>Since the issuance of that AD, the FAA has become aware that the compliance time specified in paragraph (a) of AD 93-24-11 for accomplishment of the modification could allow certain operators to accomplish the modification at a time considerably later than that intended. Paragraph (a) of that AD currently requires that the modification be accomplished prior to the accumulation of 12,000 total landings after January 10, 1994 (the effective date of AD 93-24-11, Amendment 39-8760), or within 300 days after that date, whichever occurs later. However, the FAA's intent is that the modification be accomplished prior to the accumulation of 12,000 total landings on the airplane, or within 300 days after the effective date of the AD, whichever occurs later. The FAA has determined that AD 93-24-11 must be superseded to revise the compliance time in order to ensure that the structural integrity of the belly fairing structure is maintained in a timely manner. All other parts of the rule would remain as published originally.</textblock>
    <textblock>This airplane model is manufactured in France and is type certificated for operation in the United States under the provisions of ยง21.29 of the Federal Aviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement. The FAA has determined that AD action is necessary for products of this type design that are certificated in the United States.</textblock>
    <textblock>Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes of the same type design registered in the United States, the proposed AD would supersede AD 93-24-11 to continue to require modification of the belly fairing structure. This proposed AD would revise the compliance time to require accomplishment of that modification prior to the accumulation of 12,000 total landings on the airplane, or within 300 days after January 10, 1994, whichever occurs later. The actions would continue to be required to be accomplished in accordance with Airbus Industrie Service Bulletin A320-53-1014, dated June 25, 1992, or Revision 1, dated May 26, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA estimates that 20 airplanes of U.S. registry were affected by AD 93-24-11, and would continue to be affected by this proposed supersedure of that AD. It takes approximately 288 work hours per airplane to accomplish the actions currently required by AD 93-24-11, and the average labor rate is $55 per work hour. Required parts cost approximately $1,045 per airplane. Based on these figures, the current cost impact of AD 93-24-11 on U.S. operators is estimated to be $337,700, or $16,885 per airplane.</textblock>
    <textblock>The total cost figure indicated above is presented as if no operator has yet accomplished the requirements of AD 93-24-11 (or this proposed supersedure of that AD). There are no foreseeable additional costs that would be imposed by this proposed supersedure of AD 93-24-11.</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficient federalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.</textblock>
