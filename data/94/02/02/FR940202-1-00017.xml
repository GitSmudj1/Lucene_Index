    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>In the rules and regulations section of this issue of</textblock>
    <textblock>the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>, the IRS is issuing a temporary regulation</textblock>
    <textblock>that adds an anti-abuse rule to the final regulations relating to</textblock>
    <textblock>the tax treatment of debt instruments with original issue</textblock>
    <textblock>discount. The rule allows the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,</textblock>
    <textblock>in certain circumstances, to apply or depart from the final</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations in a manner that ensures a reasonable result in light</textblock>
    <textblock>of the purposes of the statutes governing original issue</textblock>
    <textblock>discount. The text of the temporary regulation also serves as</textblock>
    <textblock>the text of this proposed regulation. This document also</textblock>
    <textblock>withdraws the proposed regulations relating to the tax treatment</textblock>
    <textblock>of price level adjusted mortgages and the portion of the 1992</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed regulations relating to the treatment of a debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument that provides for contingent payments.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>A temporary regulation in the Rules and Regulations portion</textblock>
    <textblock>of this issue of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>amends the Income Tax</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulations (26 CFR part 1) relating to section 1275 by adding</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง1.1275-2T. The text of that temporary regulation also serves as</textblock>
    <textblock>the text of this proposed regulation. The preamble to the</textblock>
    <textblock>temporary regulation explains the temporary regulation.</textblock>
    <textblock>This document also withdraws the portion of the 1992</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed regulations relating to the treatment of a debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument under section 1274 of the Internal Revenue Code if the</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument provides for contingent payments. In addition,</textblock>
    <textblock>this document withdraws the proposed regulations relating to the</textblock>
    <textblock>tax treatment of price level adjusted mortgages.</textblock>
    <textblock>Special Analyses</textblock>
    <textblock>It has been determined that this notice of proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>rulemaking is not a significant regulatory action as defined in</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12866. It also has been determined that section</textblock>
    <textblock>553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 5)</textblock>
    <textblock>and the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. chapter 6) do not</textblock>
    <textblock>apply to these regulations, and, therefore, a Regulatory</textblock>
    <textblock>Flexibility Analysis is not required. Pursuant to section</textblock>
    <textblock>7805(f) of the Internal Revenue Code, this notice of proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>rulemaking will be submitted to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of</textblock>
    <textblock>the Small Business Administration for comment on its impact on</textblock>
    <textblock>small business.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comments and Public Hearing</textblock>
    <textblock>Before the proposed regulation relating to the anti-abuse</textblock>
    <textblock>rule is adopted as a final regulation, consideration will be</textblock>
    <textblock>given to any written comments that are submitted timely</textblock>
    <textblock>(preferably a signed original and eight copies) to the IRS. All</textblock>
    <textblock>comments will be available for public inspection and copying. A</textblock>
    <textblock>public hearing may be scheduled and held upon written request by</textblock>
    <textblock>any person who submits written comments on the proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>regulation. Notice of the time and place for the hearing will be</textblock>
    <textblock>published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>List of Subjects in 26 CFR Part 1</textblock>
