    <textblock>V. Risk Factors and Control Measures</textblock>
    <textblock>Several large studies have examined potential risk factors for nosocomial bacterial pneumonia (Table 3).</textblock>
    <textblock>7,34,35,128,129</textblock>
    <textblock>Although specific risk factors may differ between study populations, they can be grouped into the following general categories: (1) Host factors such as extremes of age and severe underlying conditions, including immunosuppression; (2) factors, such as admission to the ICU, underlying chronic lung disease, or coma, that enhance colonization of the oropharynx and/or stomach by microorganisms; (3) conditions favoring aspiration or reflux, including endotracheal intubation or insertion of nasogastric tube; (4) conditions requiring prolonged use of mechanical ventilatory support with exposure to contaminated respiratory equipment and/or contact with colonized hands of healthcare workers; and (5) factors that impede adequate pulmonary toilet, such as surgical procedures involving the head, neck, thorax, or upper abdomen, and immobilization due to trauma or illness.</textblock>
    <textblock>7,33-35,59,128</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Oropharyngeal, Tracheal, and Gastric Colonization</textblock>
    <textblock>The association between colonization of the oropharynx,</textblock>
    <textblock>81,130</textblock>
    <textblock>trachea,</textblock>
    <textblock>131</textblock>
    <textblock>or stomach</textblock>
    <textblock>103,104,110,116</textblock>
    <textblock>and predisposition to gram-negative bacillary pneumonia prompted attempts to prevent infection either by prophylactic local application of antimicrobial agent(s)</textblock>
    <textblock>132,133</textblock>
    <textblock>or utilizing the phenomenon of local bacterial interference.</textblock>
    <textblock>134,135</textblock>
    <textblock>Although early work suggested that the former method, aerosolized antimicrobials, could eradicate common gram-negative pathogens from the upper respiratory tract,</textblock>
    <textblock>131</textblock>
    <textblock>superinfection occurred in some patients receiving this therapy.</textblock>
    <textblock>132-134,136,137</textblock>
    <textblock>The latter method, bacterial interference (with alpha-hemolytic streptococci), has been successfully used by some investigators to prevent oropharyngeal colonization by aerobic gram-negative bacilli.</textblock>
    <textblock>134</textblock>
    <textblock>However, the efficacy of this method for use in general has not been evaluated.</textblock>
    <textblock>The administration of antacids and H2-blockers for prevention of stress bleeding in critically ill, postoperative, and/or mechanically ventilated patients has been associated with gastric bacterial overgrowth in many studies.</textblock>
    <textblock>34,105,106,111,115,116,138-140</textblock>
    <textblock>Sucralfate, a cytoprotective agent that has little effect on gastric pH and may have bactericidal properties of its own, has been suggested as a potential substitute for antacids and H2-blockers.</textblock>
    <textblock>141-143</textblock>
    <textblock>The results of clinical trials comparing the risk of pneumonia in patients receiving sucralfate to that in patients given antacids and/or H2-blockers have been variable.</textblock>
    <textblock>105,111,140,141,144,145</textblock>
    <textblock>In most randomized trials, ICU patients receiving mechanically assisted ventilation and antacids with or without H2-b lockers had increased gastric pH, high bacterial counts in the gastric fluid, and increased risk of pneumonia compared with patients given sucralfate.</textblock>
    <textblock>105,111,140,141,144</textblock>
    <textblock>In one report with a large number of study patients, the incidence of early-onset pneumonia (occurring &gt;4 days after intubation) did not differ between patient groups, but late-onset pneumonia occurred in 5% of 76 patients who received sucralfate, 16% of 69 given antacids, and 21% of 68 who received an H2-blocker.</textblock>
    <textblock>140</textblock>
    <textblock>On the other hand, a meta-analysis of data from eight earlier studies did not show a strong association between nosocomial pneumonia and drugs that raise gastric pH.</textblock>
    <textblock>146</textblock>
    <textblock>Further comparative studies are underway in which bronchoscopy with PSB or BAL is utilized for the diagnosis of pneumonia.</textblock>
    <textblock>Selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD) is another strategy designed to prevent bacterial colonization and lower respiratory tract infection in mechanically ventilated patients.</textblock>
    <textblock>147-170</textblock>
    <textblock>SDD is aimed at preventing oropharyngeal and gastric colonization with aerobic gram-negative bacilli and</textblock>
    <textblock>Candida</textblock>
    <textblock>spp., without altering the anaerobic flora (Table 2).</textblock>
    <textblock>147-170</textblock>
    <textblock>A variety of SDD regimens use a combination of locally administered nonabsorbable antibiotic agents such as polymyxin, an aminoglycoside (tobramycin, gentamicin, or, rarely, neomycin), or a quinolone (norfloxacin or ciprofloxacin), coupled with either amphotericin B or nystatin. The local antimicrobial preparation is applied as a paste to the oropharynx and given orally or via the nasogastric tube four times a day. In addition, in many studies, a systemic (intravenous) antimicrobial such as cefotaxime or trimethoprim is administered to the patient.</textblock>
    <textblock>While most clinical trials,</textblock>
    <textblock>147-151,153-160,162,164,169</textblock>
    <textblock>including two meta-analyses,</textblock>
    <textblock>163,170</textblock>
    <textblock>of SDD have demonstrated a decrease in the rates of nosocomial respiratory infections, these trials have been difficult to assess because they have differed in study design and population, and many have had short follow-up periods (Table 2). In most of these studies, the diagnosis of pneumonia was based on clinical criteria; bronchoscopy with BAL or PSB was used in only a few studies.</textblock>
    <textblock>152,153,164,167,169</textblock>
    <textblock>Two recently published large double-blind, placebo-controlled trials demonstrated no benefit from SDD.</textblock>
    <textblock>166,167</textblock>
    <textblock>In one, a large French multicenter study by Gastinne et al, a significant decrease in incidence of gram-negative bacillary pneumonia was not accompanied by a decrease in pneumonia from all causes.</textblock>
    <textblock>167</textblock>
    <textblock>In the other study, by Hammond et al, no differences were noted between patients randomized to SDD or to placebo; however, both patient groups received intravenous cefotaxime.</textblock>
    <textblock>166</textblock>
    <textblock>Although an earlier meta-analysis suggested a trend toward decreased mortality in patients given SDD,</textblock>
    <textblock>163</textblock>
    <textblock>a more recent and more extensive analysis highlights the equivocal effect of SDD on patient mortality, as well as the high cost of using SDD to prevent pneumonia or death (i.e., in order to prevent one case of nosocomial pneumonia, or one death due to nosocomial pneumonia, 6 [range: 5-9] or 23 [range: 13-39] patients, respectively, would have to be given SDD.</textblock>
    <textblock>170</textblock>
    <textblock>Furthermore, there are concerns over the development of antimicrobial resistance and superinfection with gram-positive bacteria and other antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens.</textblock>
    <textblock>148,149,152,155</textblock>
    <textblock>Thus, currently available data do not justify the routine use of SDD for prevention of nosocomial pneumonia in ICU patients. SDD may be ultimately useful for specific subsets of ICU patients, such as those with trauma or severe immunosuppression, e.g., bone-marrow transplant recipients.</textblock>
    <textblock>A new approach advocated to prevent oropharyngeal colonization in patients receiving enteral nutrition is to reduce bacterial colonization of the stomach by acidifying the enteral feed.</textblock>
    <textblock>171</textblock>
    <textblock>Although the absence of bacteria from the stomach has been confirmed in patients given acidified enteral feeding, the effect on the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia has not been evaluated.</textblock>
