    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>These final rules update the statutory disregards in regulations for the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program, and the adult assistance programs in Guam, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands by adding the income and resources disregards provided under several public laws. The disregards are: (1) Section 479B of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by Public Law 102-325, the Higher Education Amendments of 1992, which provides that student financial assistance received under the programs in title IV of the Higher Education Act, or under Bureau of Indian Affairs student assistance programs, will not be taken into account in determining need or amount of benefits; (2) section 501(c) of Public Law 101-392, the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Applied Technology Education Act Amendments of 1990, which provides that student financial assistance made for attendance costs will not be counted as income or resources; (3) section 105 of Public Law 100-383, the Civil Liberties Act of 1988, which provides that restitution made to individuals of Japanese ancestry who were interned during World War II will not be counted as income or resources, and section 206 of Public Law 100-383, the Aleutian and Pribilof Islands Restitution Act, which provides that restitution made to Aleuts who were relocated by the United States government during World War II will not be counted as income or resources; (4) section 105 of Public Law 100-707, the Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Amendments of 1988, which provides that major disaster and emergency assistance will not be counted as income or resources; (5) section 1(a) of Public Law 101-201 and section 10405 of Public Law 101-239, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, which both provide that Agent Orange payments will not be counted as income or resources; and (6) section 6(h)(2) of Public Law 101-426, the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which provides that amounts paid pursuant to this Act will not be counted as income and resources.</textblock>
    <textblock>These final rules also amend the existing regulations to provide that bona fide loans will not be counted as income or resources.</textblock>
