    <textblock>Purpose of Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement.</textblock>
    <textblock>Purusant to the regulations (40 CFR 1501.7) implementing the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>), as amended, MMS is announcing its intent to prepare an EIS regarding the gas and oil leasing proposal known as OCS Gas and Oil Lease Sale 148 Chukchi Sea. Throughout the scoping process, Federal, State, and local governments and other interested parties have the opportunity to aid MMS in determing the significant issues and alternatives to be analyzed in the EIS and the possible need for additional information.</textblock>
    <textblock>The EIS analysis will focus on the potential environmental effects of leasing, exploration, and development of the blocks included in the area defined in the Area Identification procedure as the proposed area of the Federal action. Alternatives to the proposal that may be considered are to delay the sale, cancel the sale, or modify the sale. The Proposed Final Comprehensive Program 1992-1997 indicated that during the prelease process for this sale, consideration will be given to establishing a coastal buffer.</textblock>
