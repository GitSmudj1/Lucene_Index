    <textblock>Adoption of Amendments to the Regulations</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, 26 CFR parts 1 and 602 are amended as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 1_INCOME TAXES</textblock>
    <textblock>Paragraph 1.</textblock>
    <textblock>The authority citation for part 1 is amended</textblock>
    <textblock>by removing the entry for ``Section 1.1275-3'' and adding the</textblock>
    <textblock>following citations in numerical order to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>26 U.S.C. 7805 *␣*␣*</textblock>
    <textblock>§§1.483-1 through 1.483-3 also issued under 26 U.S.C.</textblock>
    <textblock>483(f). *␣*␣*</textblock>
    <textblock>§§1.1271-1 through 1.1274-5 also issued under 26 U.S.C.</textblock>
    <textblock>1275(d).</textblock>
    <textblock>§1.1274A-1 also issued under 26 U.S.C. 1274A(e) and 26</textblock>
    <textblock>U.S.C. 1275(d).</textblock>
    <textblock>§§1.1275-1 through 1.1275-5 also issued under 26 U.S.C.</textblock>
    <textblock>1275(d). *␣*␣*</textblock>
    <textblock>Par. 2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 1.163-7 is added to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§1.163-7</textblock>
    <textblock>Deduction for OID on certain debt instruments.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>General rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>Except as otherwise provided in paragraph</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) of this section, an issuer (including a transferee)</textblock>
    <textblock>determines the amount of OID that is deductible each year under</textblock>
    <textblock>section 163(e)(1) by using the constant yield method described in</textblock>
    <textblock>§1.1272-1(b). This determination, however, is made without</textblock>
    <textblock>regard to section 1272(a)(7) (relating to acquisition premium)</textblock>
    <textblock>and §1.1273-1(d) (relating to de minimis OID). An issuer is</textblock>
    <textblock>permitted a deduction under section 163(e)(1) only to the extent</textblock>
    <textblock>the issuer is primarily liable on the debt instrument. For</textblock>
    <textblock>certain limitations on the deductibility of OID, see sections</textblock>
    <textblock>163(e) and 1275(b)(2).</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Special rules for de minimis OID</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Stated interest</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>If a debt instrument has a de minimis amount of OID (within the</textblock>
    <textblock>meaning of §1.1273-1(d)), the issuer treats all stated interest</textblock>
    <textblock>on the debt instrument as qualified stated interest. See</textblock>
    <textblock>§§1.446-2(b) and 1.461-1 for the treatment of qualified stated</textblock>
    <textblock>interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Deduction of de minimis OID on other than a constant</textblock>
    <textblock>yield basis.</textblock>
    <textblock>In lieu of deducting de minimis OID under the</textblock>
    <textblock>general rule of paragraph (a) of this section, an issuer of a</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument with a de minimis amount of OID (other than a de</textblock>
    <textblock>minimis amount treated as qualified stated interest under</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph (b)(1) of this section) may choose to deduct the OID at</textblock>
    <textblock>maturity, on a straight-line basis over the term of the debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument, or in proportion to stated interest payments. The</textblock>
    <textblock>issuer makes this choice by reporting the de minimis OID in a</textblock>
    <textblock>manner consistent with the method chosen on the issuer's timely</textblock>
    <textblock>filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument is issued.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c)</textblock>
    <textblock>Deduction upon repurchase.</textblock>
    <textblock>Except to the extent</textblock>
    <textblock>disallowed by any other section of the Internal Revenue Code</textblock>
    <textblock>(e.g., section 249) or this paragraph (c), if a debt instrument</textblock>
    <textblock>is repurchased by the issuer for a price in excess of its</textblock>
    <textblock>adjusted issue price (as defined in §1.1275-1(b)), the excess</textblock>
    <textblock>(repurchase premium) is deductible as interest for the taxable</textblock>
    <textblock>year in which the repurchase occurs. If the issuer repurchases a</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument in a debt-for-debt exchange, the repurchase price</textblock>
    <textblock>is the issue price of the newly issued debt instrument (reduced</textblock>
    <textblock>by any unstated interest within the meaning of section 483).</textblock>
    <textblock>However, if the issue price of the newly issued debt instrument</textblock>
    <textblock>is determined under either section 1273(b)(4) or section 1274,</textblock>
    <textblock>any repurchase premium is not deductible in the year of the</textblock>
    <textblock>repurchase, but is amortized over the term of the newly issued</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument in the same manner as if it were OID.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d)</textblock>
    <textblock>Choice of accrual periods to determine whether a debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument is an applicable high yield discount obligation</textblock>
    <textblock>(AHYDO).</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 163(e)(5) affects an issuer's OID deductions</textblock>
    <textblock>for certain high yield debt instruments that have significant</textblock>
    <textblock>OID. For purposes of section 163(i)(2), which defines</textblock>
    <textblock>significant OID, the issuer's choice of accrual periods to</textblock>
    <textblock>determine OID accruals is used to determine whether a debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument has significant OID. See §1.1275-2(e) for rules</textblock>
    <textblock>relating to the issuer's obligation to disclose certain</textblock>
    <textblock>information to holders.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e)</textblock>
    <textblock>Effective date.</textblock>
    <textblock>This section applies to debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instruments issued on or after April 4, 1994. Taxpayers, however, may rely on this section for debt instruments issued after December 21, 1992, and before April 4, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>§1.163-11T</textblock>
    <textblock>[Removed]</textblock>
    <textblock>Par. 3.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 1.163-11T is removed as of February 2, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>Par. 4.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 1.446-2 is added to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§1.446-2</textblock>
    <textblock>Method of accounting for interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>In general.</textblock>
    <textblock>This section provides</textblock>
    <textblock>rules for determining the amount of interest that accrues during</textblock>
    <textblock>an accrual period (other than interest described in paragraph</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)(2) of this section) and for determining the portion of a</textblock>
    <textblock>payment that consists of accrued interest. For purposes of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section, interest includes original issue discount and amounts</textblock>
    <textblock>treated as interest (whether stated or unstated) in any lending</textblock>
    <textblock>or deferred payment transaction. Accrued interest determined</textblock>
    <textblock>under this section is taken into account by a taxpayer under the</textblock>
    <textblock>taxpayer's regular method of accounting (e.g., an accrual method</textblock>
    <textblock>or the cash receipts and disbursements method). Application of</textblock>
    <textblock>an exception described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to one</textblock>
    <textblock>party to a transaction does not affect the application of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section to any other party to the transaction.</textblock>
