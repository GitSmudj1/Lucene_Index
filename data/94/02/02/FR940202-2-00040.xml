    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to Title IV of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR Part 73, the EPA is responsible for implementing a program to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>), a precursor of acid rain. The centerpiece of the SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>control program is the allocation of transferable allowances, or authorizations to emit SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>, which are distributed in limited quantities for existing utility units and which eventually must be held by virtually all utility units to cover their SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>emissions. These allowances may be transferred among polluting sources and others, so that market forces may govern their ultimate use and distribution, resulting in the most cost-effective sharing of the emissions control burden. In addition, EPA is directed under Section 416 of the Act to conduct annual sales and auctions of a small portion of allowances (2.8%) withheld from the total allowances allocated to utilities each year. Sales and auctions are expected to stimulate and support such a market in allowances and to provide a public source of allowances, particularly to new units for which no allowances are allocated. Today, the Acid Rain Division is giving notice of the second annual SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>allowance auctions. The regulations governing the auctions and sales were promulgated on December 17, 1991 (40 CFR part 73, subpart E).</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA has delegated the administration of the EPA allowance auctions to the Chicago Board of Trade (CBOT). The auctions will be conducted under the regulations cited above. Anyone can participate in the EPA auctions and bidders are not restricted as to the quantity or price of their bid. Allowances sold at the auctions will be sold to the highest bidder until no allowances remain. The 1994 auctions will consist of one ``spot'' auction and two ``advance'' auctions. Allowances sold in the spot auction are useable for compliance beginning in 1995. Allowances sold in the 6-year advance auction are useable for compliance beginning in 2000; allowances sold in the 7-year advance auction are useable for compliance beginning in 2001. 25,000 allowances will be sold in the 6-year advance auction, which are the unsold allowances from the 1993 direct sale. 50,000 spot allowances will be sold in the spot auction and 100,000 allowances will be sold in the 7-year advance auction. Bid Forms for the 1994 auctions must be received by the CBOT by the close of business on March 22, 1994. The auctions themselves will be conducted on March 28, 1994, with the results announced the next day.</textblock>
    <textblock>CBOT will also sell in the 1994 auctions any spot, 6-year advance, or 7-year advance allowances that are offered by others holding allowances in EPA's Allowance Tracking System. However, offered allowances will be sold after the allowances that were withheld from the utilities, so offered allowances will consequently be sold at a lower price than the withheld allowances. Owners of offered allowances may set a minimum price for their allowances. To offer allowances in the EPA auctions, owners of allowances must submit an SO</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>Allowance Offer Form to EPA by the close of business on March 11, 1994. The auction and sale regulations require that offer forms be received by EPA no later than 15 business days prior to the date of the auctions, which would be March 4, 1994. However, this year, the date that offer forms must be received by EPA is being extended to March 11, 1994 due to the delay in the opening of the Allowance Tracking System. This extension will not be implemented permanently and only applies to the 1994 auctions.</textblock>
