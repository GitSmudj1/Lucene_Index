    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) designates critical habitat for the least Bell's vireo (Vireo bellii pusillus), an endangered species, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act). This designation encompasses a total of about 38,000 acres at 10 localities in portions of 6 counties in southern California. This designation results in additional protection requirements under section 7 of the Act for activities that are funded, authorized, or carried out by a Federal agency. The Service has considered economic and other relevant impacts in making a final decision on the size and scope of critical habitat.</textblock>

    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Introduction</textblock>
    <textblock>The Act requires the Service to designate critical habitat to the maximum extent prudent and determinable concurrently with listing a species as endangered or threatened. On November 8, 1979, the Service received a petition from James M. Greaves to list the Arizona (</textblock>
    <textblock>V. b. arizonae</textblock>
    <textblock>) and least Bell's vireos as endangered. A notice of acceptance of the petition and status review was published on February 6, 1980 (45 FR 8030). Based on the best scientific and commercial data available and comments submitted during the status review, the Service found that the petitioned action was warranted for the least Bell's vireo on October 13, 1983 (49 FR 2485, January 20, 1984); however, a listing action was precluded by other pending listing actions of higher priority, in accordance with section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (Act), as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq</textblock>
    <textblock>.). Section 4(b)(3)(C)(i) recycles such petitions, resulting in a new finding deadline of October 13, 1984. A finding was made on October 12, 1984, that this action was still warranted but precluded. The Service published a proposed rule to determine the least Bell's vireo to be an endangered species, and to designate critical habitat for the species on May 3, 1985 (50 FR 18968). This proposed rule constituted the next finding required under section 4(b)(3)(B)(ii) of the Act. A correction to some of the legal descriptions of the proposed critical habitat was published in the June 4, 1985,</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(50 FR 23458). Rather than delay protected status for the vireo while the economic analysis that must accompany the final rule designating critical habitat was being prepared, the Service decided to make final only the listing portion of the rule to provide the Act's protection to the least Bell's vireo. Section 4(b)(6)(c)(ii) of the Act allows the Service to postpone designation of critical habitat for up to 12 months. On May 2, 1986, the vireo was listed as endangered and the comment period on proposed designation of critical habitat was reopened for an additional 90 days (51 FR 16483). A further extension of the comment period to January 1, 1987, was published on July 31, 1986 (51 FR 27429). A revised proposed rule was published on August 7, 1992 (57 FR 34892) at which time the public comment period was reopened for 90 days.</textblock>
