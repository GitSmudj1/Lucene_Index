    <textblock>§1.1274-3</textblock>
    <textblock>Potentially abusive situations defined.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>In general.</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of section 1274, a potentially</textblock>
    <textblock>abusive situation means-_</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) A tax shelter (as defined in section 6662(d)(2)(C)(ii));</textblock>
    <textblock>or</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Any other situation involving_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) A recent sales transaction;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Nonrecourse financing;</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Financing with a term in excess of the useful life of</textblock>
    <textblock>the property; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) A debt instrument with clearly excessive interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Operating rules</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Debt instrument exchanged for</textblock>
    <textblock>nonrecourse financing.</textblock>
    <textblock>Nonrecourse financing does not include an</textblock>
    <textblock>exchange of a nonrecourse debt instrument for an outstanding</textblock>
    <textblock>recourse or nonrecourse debt instrument.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Nonrecourse debt with substantial down payment.</textblock>
    <textblock>Nonrecourse financing does not include a sale or exchange of a</textblock>
    <textblock>real property interest financed by a nonrecourse debt instrument</textblock>
    <textblock>if, in addition to the nonrecourse debt instrument, the purchaser</textblock>
    <textblock>makes a down payment in money that equals or exceeds 20 percent</textblock>
    <textblock>of the total stated purchase price of the real property interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of the preceding sentence, a real property interest</textblock>
    <textblock>means any interest, other than an interest solely as a creditor,</textblock>
    <textblock>in real property.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Clearly excessive interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>Interest on a debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument is clearly excessive if the interest, in light of the</textblock>
    <textblock>terms of the debt instrument and the creditworthiness of the</textblock>
    <textblock>borrower, is clearly greater than the arm's length amount of</textblock>
    <textblock>interest that would have been charged in a cash lending</textblock>
    <textblock>transaction between the same two parties.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c)</textblock>
    <textblock>Other situations to be specified by Commissioner.</textblock>
    <textblock>The</textblock>
    <textblock>Commissioner may designate in the Internal Revenue Bulletin</textblock>
    <textblock>situations that, although described in paragraph (a)(2) of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section, will not be treated as potentially abusive because they</textblock>
    <textblock>do not have the effect of significantly misstating basis or</textblock>
    <textblock>amount realized (see §601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter).</textblock>
    <textblock>(d)</textblock>
    <textblock>Consistency rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The issuer's determination that the</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument is or is not issued in a potentially abusive</textblock>
    <textblock>situation is binding on all holders of the debt instrument.</textblock>
    <textblock>However, the issuer's determination is not binding on a holder</textblock>
    <textblock>who explicitly discloses a position that is inconsistent with the</textblock>
    <textblock>issuer's determination. Unless otherwise prescribed by the</textblock>
    <textblock>Commissioner, the disclosure must be made on a statement attached</textblock>
    <textblock>to the holder's timely filed Federal income tax return for the</textblock>
    <textblock>taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument. See §1.1275-2(e) for rules relating to the issuer's</textblock>
    <textblock>obligation to disclose certain information to holders.</textblock>
