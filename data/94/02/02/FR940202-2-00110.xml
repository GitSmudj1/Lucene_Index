    <textblock>In hospitals where the heated-water system has been identified as the source of the organism, the system has been decontaminated by pulse (one-time) thermal disinfection or superheating (i.e., flushing for at least 5 minutes each distal outlet of the hot-water system with water at "65</textblock>
    <textblock>○C) and hyperchlorination (flushing all outlets of the hot-water system with water containing "10 mg/L free residual chlorine).</textblock>
    <textblock>403,408-410</textblock>
    <textblock>Following either of these procedures, most hospitals maintain heated-water at "50</textblock>
    <textblock>○C or &lt;20</textblock>
    <textblock>○C at the tap or chlorinate heated water to achieve 1-2 mg/L free residual chlorine at the tap.</textblock>
    <textblock>338,383,393,400-403</textblock>
    <textblock>Additional measures, such as physical cleaning or replacement of hot-water storage tanks, water-heaters, faucets, and showerheads, may be required because scale and sediment that provide organisms protection from the biocidal effects of heat and chlorine, may accumulate in them.</textblock>
    <textblock>346,403</textblock>
    <textblock>Alternative methods for control and eradication of legionellae in water systems, such as treatment of water with ozone, ultraviolet light, or heavy metal ions, have limited the growth of legionellae under laboratory,</textblock>
    <textblock>344,411,412</textblock>
    <textblock>or, in the case of ultraviolet light, operating conditions.</textblock>
    <textblock>413</textblock>
    <textblock>However, further data are needed regarding the efficacy of these methods when used in hospital water systems</textblock>
    <textblock>414</textblock>
    <textblock>before they can be considered standard. In hospitals where the cooling towers are contaminated, measures for decontamination have been previously published.</textblock>
    <textblock>415</textblock>
    <textblock>For highly immunocompromised patients, other preventive measures have been used. At one hospital, immunosuppressed patients were restricted from taking showers, and, for these patients, only sterile water was used for drinking or flushing nasogastric tubes;</textblock>
    <textblock>384</textblock>
    <textblock>In another hospital, a combined approach, consisting of continuous heating, particulate filtration, ultraviolet treatment, and monthly pulse hyperchlorination of the water supply of the bone-marrow transplant unit, was used to decrease the incidence of Legionnaires' disease.</textblock>
    <textblock>413</textblock>
    <textblock>In view of the high cost of an environmental investigation and of instituting control measures to eradicate</textblock>
    <textblock>Legionella</textblock>
    <textblock>spp. from sources in the hospital</textblock>
    <textblock>416,417</textblock>
    <textblock>and the differential risk, based on host factors, for acquiring nosocomial legionellosis and of having severe and fatal infection with the microorganism, the decision to search for and the choice of procedures to eradicate hospital environmental sources of</textblock>
    <textblock>Legionella</textblock>
    <textblock>spp. should take into account the type of patient population served by the hospital.</textblock>
    <textblock>ASPERGILLOSIS</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Epidemiology</textblock>
    <textblock>Aspergillus</textblock>
    <textblock>spp. are ubiquitous fungi, commonly occurring in soil, water, and decaying vegetation.</textblock>
    <textblock>Aspergillus</textblock>
    <textblock>spp. have been cultured from unfiltered air, ventilation systems, contaminated dust dislodged during hospital renovation and construction, horizontal surfaces, food, and ornamental plants.</textblock>
    <textblock>418</textblock>
    <textblock>A. fumigatus</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>A. flavus</textblock>
    <textblock>are the most frequently isolated</textblock>
    <textblock>Aspergillus</textblock>
    <textblock>spp. in patients with proven aspergillosis.</textblock>
    <textblock>419</textblock>
    <textblock>Nosocomial aspergillosis has been recognized increasingly as a cause of severe illness and mortality in highly immunocompromised patients, e.g., patients undergoing chemotherapy and/or organ transplantation, including bone-marrow transplantation for hematologic and other malignant neoplasms.</textblock>
    <textblock>420-423</textblock>
    <textblock>The most important nosocomial infection due to</textblock>
    <textblock>Aspergillus</textblock>
    <textblock>spp. is pneumonia.</textblock>
    <textblock>424</textblock>
    <textblock>Hospital outbreaks of pulmonary aspergillosis have occurred mainly in granulocytopenic patients, especially in bone-marrow transplant units.</textblock>
    <textblock>424-430</textblock>
    <textblock>Although invasive aspergillosis has been reported in recipients of solid-organ transplants (e.g., heart or kidney),</textblock>
    <textblock>431-435</textblock>
    <textblock>the incidence of</textblock>
    <textblock>Aspergillus</textblock>
    <textblock>spp. infections in these patients has been lower than in recipients of bone-marrow transplants, probably because of the recent decrease in the use of corticosteroids and the introduction of cyclosporine.</textblock>
    <textblock>433,436</textblock>
    <textblock>In solid-organ transplant recipients, the efficacy of infection control measures, such as provision of protected environments and prophylaxis with antifungal agents, in preventing aspergillosis has not been well evaluated.</textblock>
    <textblock>433,434,437-439</textblock>
    <textblock>In one study of heart-transplant recipients, protective isolation of patients alone failed to prevent fungal infections.</textblock>
    <textblock>440</textblock>
    <textblock>The reported attributable mortality from invasive pulmonary aspergillosis has varied, depending on the patient population studied. Rates have been as high as 95% in recipients of allogeneic bone-marrow transplants and patients with aplastic anemia, compared with rates of 13-80% in leukemic patients.</textblock>
    <textblock>441-443</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Pathogenesis</textblock>
    <textblock>In contrast to most bacterial pneumonias, the primary route of acquiring</textblock>
    <textblock>Aspergillus</textblock>
    <textblock>sp. infection is by inhalation of the fungal spores. In severely immunocompromised patients, primary</textblock>
    <textblock>Aspergillus</textblock>
    <textblock>spp. pneumonia results from local lung tissue invasion.</textblock>
    <textblock>419,444,445</textblock>
    <textblock>Subsequently, the fungus may disseminate via the bloodstream to involve multiple other deep organs.</textblock>
    <textblock>419,445,446</textblock>
    <textblock>A role for nasopharyngeal colonization with</textblock>
    <textblock>Aspergillus</textblock>
    <textblock>spp., as an intermediate step before invasive pulmonary disease, has been proposed, but remains to be elucidated.</textblock>
    <textblock>438,447,448</textblock>
    <textblock>On the other hand, colonization of the lower respiratory tract by</textblock>
    <textblock>Aspergillus</textblock>
    <textblock>spp., especially in patients with preexisting lung disease such as chronic obstructive lung disease, cystic fibrosis, or inactive tuberculosis, has predisposed patients to invasive pulmonary and/or disseminated infection.</textblock>
