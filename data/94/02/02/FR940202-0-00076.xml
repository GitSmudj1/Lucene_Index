    <textblock>Disclosure of certain information to holders.</textblock>
    <textblock>Certain</textblock>
    <textblock>provisions of the regulations under section 163(e) and sections</textblock>
    <textblock>1271 through 1275 provide that the issuer's determination of an</textblock>
    <textblock>item controls the holder's treatment of the item. In such a</textblock>
    <textblock>case, the issuer must provide the relevant information to the</textblock>
    <textblock>holder in a reasonable manner. For example, the issuer may</textblock>
    <textblock>provide the name or title and either the address or telephone</textblock>
    <textblock>number of a representative of the issuer who will make available</textblock>
    <textblock>to holders upon request the information required for holders to</textblock>
    <textblock>comply with these provisions of the regulations.</textblock>

    <textblock>Treatment of pro rata prepayments_</textblock>
    <textblock>(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Treatment as</textblock>
    <textblock>retirement of separate debt instrument.</textblock>
    <textblock>A pro rata prepayment is</textblock>
    <textblock>treated as a payment in retirement of a portion of a debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument, which may result in a gain or loss to the holder.</textblock>
    <textblock>Generally, the gain or loss is calculated by assuming that the</textblock>
    <textblock>original debt instrument consists of two instruments, one that is</textblock>
    <textblock>retired and one that remains outstanding. The adjusted issue</textblock>
    <textblock>price, holder's adjusted basis, and accrued but unpaid OID of the</textblock>
    <textblock>original debt instrument, determined immediately before the pro</textblock>
    <textblock>rata prepayment, are allocated between these two instruments</textblock>
    <textblock>based on the portion of the instrument that is treated as retired</textblock>
    <textblock>by the pro rata prepayment.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Definition of pro rata prepayment.</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a pro rata prepayment is a</textblock>
    <textblock>payment on a debt instrument made prior to maturity that_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Is not made pursuant to the instrument's payment</textblock>
    <textblock>schedule (including a payment schedule determined under §1.1272-</textblock>
    <textblock>1(c)); and</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Results in a substantially pro rata reduction of each</textblock>
    <textblock>payment remaining to be paid on the instrument.</textblock>

    <textblock>Par. 13.</textblock>
    <textblock>In §1.1275-3, the section heading and paragraphs (a) and (b) are revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§1.1275-3</textblock>
    <textblock>OID information reporting requirements.</textblock>

    <textblock>Except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) or paragraph (d) of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section, this paragraph (b) applies to any debt instrument that</textblock>
    <textblock>is not publicly offered (within the meaning of §1.1275-1(h)), is</textblock>
    <textblock>issued in physical form, and has OID. The issuer of any such</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument must legend the instrument by stating on the face</textblock>
    <textblock>of the instrument that the debt instrument was issued with OID.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, the issuer must either_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Set forth on the face of the debt instrument the issue</textblock>
    <textblock>price, the amount of OID, the issue date, and the yield to</textblock>
    <textblock>maturity; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Provide the name or title and either the address or</textblock>
    <textblock>telephone number of a representative of the issuer who will,</textblock>

    <textblock>instrument when it is first issued in physical form. Legending</textblock>
    <textblock>is not required, however, before the first holder of the debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument disposes of the instrument.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Legend must survive reissuance upon transfer.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any new</textblock>
    <textblock>physical security that is issued (for example, upon registration</textblock>
    <textblock>of transfer of ownership) must contain any required legend.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4)</textblock>
    <textblock>Exceptions.</textblock>

    <textblock>defined in §1.6049-4(f)(2)), REMIC regular interests or other</textblock>
