    <textblock>Examples.</textblock>
    <textblock>The following examples illustrate the rules</textblock>
    <textblock>of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 1. Qualified stated interest</textblock>
    <textblock>_(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>Facts.</textblock>
    <textblock>On</textblock>
    <textblock>January 1, 1995, A purchases at original issue, for $100,000, a</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument that matures on January 1, 1999, and has a stated</textblock>
    <textblock>principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument provides for interest payments of $8,000 on January 1,</textblock>
    <textblock>1996, and January 1, 1997, and quarterly interest payments of</textblock>
    <textblock>$1,942.65, beginning on April 1, 1997.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii)</textblock>
    <textblock>Amount of qualified stated interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>The annual</textblock>
    <textblock>payments of $8,000 and the quarterly payments of $1,942.65 are</textblock>
    <textblock>payable at a single fixed rate because 8 percent, compounded</textblock>
    <textblock>annually, is equivalent to 7.77 percent, compounded quarterly.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consequently, all stated interest payments under the debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument are qualified stated interest payments.</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 2. Qualified stated interest with short initial</textblock>
    <textblock>payment interval.</textblock>
    <textblock>On October 1, 1994, A purchases at original</textblock>
    <textblock>issue, for $100,000, a debt instrument that matures on January 1,</textblock>
    <textblock>1998, and has a stated principal amount of $100,000, payable at</textblock>
    <textblock>maturity. The debt instrument provides for an interest payment</textblock>
    <textblock>of $2,000 on January 1, 1995, and interest payments of $8,000 on</textblock>
    <textblock>January 1, 1996, January 1, 1997, and January 1, 1998. Under</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph (c)(1)(iii)(B) of this section, all stated interest</textblock>
    <textblock>payments on the debt instrument are computed at a single fixed</textblock>
    <textblock>rate and are qualified stated interest payments.</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 3. Stated interest in excess of qualified stated</textblock>
    <textblock>interest</textblock>
    <textblock>_(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>Facts.</textblock>
    <textblock>On January 1, 1995, B purchases at original</textblock>
    <textblock>issue, for $100,000, C corporation's 5-year debt instrument. The</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument provides for a principal payment of $100,000,</textblock>
    <textblock>payable at maturity, and calls for annual interest payments of</textblock>
    <textblock>$10,000 for the first 3 years and annual interest payments of</textblock>
    <textblock>$10,600 for the last 2 years.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii)</textblock>
    <textblock>Payments in excess of qualified stated interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>All</textblock>
    <textblock>of the first three interest payments and $10,000 of each of the</textblock>
    <textblock>last two interest payments are qualified stated interest payments</textblock>
    <textblock>within the meaning of paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Under</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the remaining $600 of each of</textblock>
    <textblock>the last two interest payments is included in the stated</textblock>
    <textblock>redemption price at maturity, so that the stated redemption price</textblock>
    <textblock>at maturity is $101,200. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section, the weighted average maturity of the debt instrument is</textblock>
    <textblock>4.994 years [(4 years×$600/$101,200)+(5 years×$100,600/$101,200)]. The de minimis amount, or one-fourth of 1 percent of the stated redemption price at maturity multiplied by the weighted average maturity, is $1,263.50. Because the actual amount of discount, $1,200, is less than the de minimis amount,</textblock>
    <textblock>the instrument is treated as having no OID, and, under paragraph (d)(1) of this section, all of the interest payments are treated as qualified stated interest payments.</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 4. Qualified stated interest on a debt instrument</textblock>
    <textblock>that is subject to a contingency</textblock>
    <textblock>_(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>Facts.</textblock>
    <textblock>On January 1, 1995,</textblock>
    <textblock>A issues, for $100,000, a 10-year debt instrument that provides</textblock>
    <textblock>for a $100,000 principal payment at maturity and for annual</textblock>
    <textblock>interest payments of $10,000. Under the terms of the debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument, however, the interest payments for each of the final</textblock>
    <textblock>five years will be reduced to $5,000 if a specified annual level</textblock>
    <textblock>of earnings is not attained by A by the end of year five.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii)</textblock>
    <textblock>Amount of qualified stated interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>If the payment</textblock>
    <textblock>schedule determined by assuming that the specified earnings level</textblock>
    <textblock>will be attained is treated as the debt instrument's sole payment</textblock>
    <textblock>schedule, the instrument would provide for annual qualified</textblock>
    <textblock>stated interest payments of $10,000. If the payment schedule</textblock>
    <textblock>determined by assuming that the specified earnings level will not</textblock>
    <textblock>be attained is treated as the instrument's sole payment schedule,</textblock>
    <textblock>however, only $5,000 of each annual interest payment would</textblock>
    <textblock>constitute qualified stated interest. Accordingly, under</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph (c)(2) of this section, only $5,000 of each annual</textblock>
    <textblock>interest payment constitutes qualified stated interest. Any</textblock>
    <textblock>excess of each annual interest payment over $5,000 is included in</textblock>
    <textblock>the debt instrument's stated redemption price at maturity.</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 5. De minimis OID; interest holiday</textblock>
    <textblock>_(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>Facts.</textblock>
    <textblock>On</textblock>
    <textblock>January 1, 1995, C purchases at original issue, for $97,561, a</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument that matures on January 1, 2007, and has a stated</textblock>
    <textblock>principal amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument provides for an initial interest holiday of 1 quarter</textblock>
    <textblock>and quarterly interest payments of $2,500 thereafter (beginning</textblock>
    <textblock>on July 1, 1995). The issue price of the debt instrument is</textblock>
    <textblock>$97,561. C chooses to accrue OID based on quarterly accrual</textblock>
    <textblock>periods.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii)</textblock>
    <textblock>De minimis amount of OID.</textblock>
    <textblock>But for the interest</textblock>
    <textblock>holiday, all stated interest on the debt instrument would be</textblock>
    <textblock>qualified stated interest. Under paragraph (d)(4) of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section, for purposes of determining whether the debt instrument</textblock>
    <textblock>has de minimis OID, the stated redemption price at maturity of</textblock>
    <textblock>the instrument is $100,061 ($97,561 (issue price) plus $2,500</textblock>
    <textblock>(the greater of the amount of foregone interest ($2,500) and the</textblock>
    <textblock>amount equal to the excess of the instrument's stated principal</textblock>
    <textblock>amount over its issue price ($2,439)). Thus, the debt instrument</textblock>
    <textblock>is treated as having OID of $2,500 ($100,061 minus $97,561).</textblock>
    <textblock>Because this amount is less than the de minimis amount of</textblock>
    <textblock>$3,001.83 (0.0025 multiplied by $100,061 multiplied by 12</textblock>
    <textblock>complete years to maturity), the debt instrument is treated as</textblock>
    <textblock>having no OID, and all stated interest is treated as qualified</textblock>
    <textblock>stated interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 6. De minimis OID; teaser rate</textblock>
    <textblock>_(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>Facts.</textblock>
    <textblock>The</textblock>
    <textblock>facts are the same as in</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 5</textblock>
    <textblock>of this paragraph (f) except</textblock>
    <textblock>that C uses an initial semiannual accrual period rather than an</textblock>
    <textblock>initial quarterly accrual period.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii)</textblock>
    <textblock>De minimis amount of OID.</textblock>
    <textblock>The debt instrument provides</textblock>
    <textblock>for an initial teaser rate because the interest rate for the</textblock>
    <textblock>semiannual accrual period is less than the interest rate</textblock>
    <textblock>applicable to the subsequent quarterly accrual periods. But for</textblock>
    <textblock>the initial teaser rate, all stated interest on the debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument would be qualified stated interest. Under paragraph</textblock>
    <textblock>(d)(4) of this section, for purposes of determining whether the</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument has de minimis OID, the stated redemption price</textblock>
    <textblock>at maturity of the instrument is $100,123.50 ($97,561 (issue</textblock>
    <textblock>price) plus $2,562.50 (the greater of the amount of foregone</textblock>
    <textblock>interest ($2,562.50) and the amount equal to the excess of the</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument's stated principal amount over its issue price</textblock>
    <textblock>($2,439)). Thus, the debt instrument is treated as having OID of</textblock>
    <textblock>$2,562.50 ($100,123.50 minus $97,561). Because this amount is</textblock>
    <textblock>less than the de minimis amount of $3,003.71 (0.0025 multiplied</textblock>
    <textblock>by $100,123.50 multiplied by 12 complete years to maturity), the</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument is treated as having no OID, and all stated</textblock>
    <textblock>interest is treated as qualified stated interest.</textblock>
