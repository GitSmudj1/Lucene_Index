    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Fokker Model F28 Mark 0100 series airplanes. This proposal would require inspections to detect corrosion in the wheel axles of the main landing gear (MLG) sliding members; and, if any corrosion is found, rework of corroded areas and an inspection to detect cracks in the wheel axles; and, if any crack is found, replacement of the cracked sliding member. This proposal is prompted by a report that a MLG wheel axle failed during push back of an in-service airplane from the terminal. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent failure of the MLG wheel axle due to the problems associated with corrosion and cracking.</textblock>
