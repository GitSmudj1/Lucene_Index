    <textblock>certain other provisions.</textblock>
    <textblock>This section does not apply to</textblock>
    <textblock>interest that is taken into account under_</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) Sections 1272(a), 1275, and 163(e) (income and</textblock>
    <textblock>deductions relating to original issue discount);</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) Section 467(a)(2) (certain payments for the use of</textblock>

    <textblock>De minimis original issue discount.</textblock>
    <textblock>This section does</textblock>
    <textblock>not apply to de minimis original issue discount (other than de</textblock>
    <textblock>minimis original issue discount treated as qualified stated</textblock>
    <textblock>interest) as determined under §1.1273-1(d). See §1.163-7 for</textblock>
    <textblock>the treatment of de minimis original issue discount by the issuer</textblock>

    <textblock>Qualified stated</textblock>
    <textblock>interest (as defined in §1.1273-1(c)) accrues ratably over the</textblock>
    <textblock>accrual period (or periods) to which it is attributable and</textblock>

    <textblock>interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subject to the modifications in paragraph (d) of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section, the amount of interest (other than qualified stated</textblock>
    <textblock>interest) that accrues for any accrual period is determined under</textblock>
    <textblock>rules similar to those in the regulations under sections 1272 and</textblock>
    <textblock>1275 for the accrual of original issue discount. The preceding</textblock>
    <textblock>sentence applies regardless of any contrary formula agreed to by</textblock>
    <textblock>the parties.</textblock>

    <textblock>Issue price.</textblock>
    <textblock>The issue price of the</textblock>
    <textblock>loan or contract is equal to_</textblock>

    <textblock>§1.483-2(a)(1)(i) or (ii), whichever is applicable;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) In the case of a contract for the sale or exchange of</textblock>
    <textblock>property to which section 483 does not apply, the stated</textblock>
    <textblock>principal amount; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) In any other case, the amount loaned.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Principal payments that are not deferred payments.</textblock>
    <textblock>In</textblock>
    <textblock>the case of a contract to which section 483 applies, principal</textblock>
    <textblock>payments that are not deferred payments are ignored for purposes</textblock>
    <textblock>of determining yield and adjusted issue price.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e)</textblock>
    <textblock>Allocation of interest to payments</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>In general.</textblock>
    <textblock>Except as provided in paragraphs (e)(2), (e)(3), and (e)(4) of</textblock>
    <textblock>this section, each payment under a loan (other than payments of</textblock>
    <textblock>additional interest or similar charges provided with respect to</textblock>
    <textblock>amounts that are not paid when due) is treated as a payment of</textblock>
    <textblock>interest to the extent of the accrued and unpaid interest</textblock>
    <textblock>determined under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section as of the</textblock>
    <textblock>date the payment becomes due.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>

    <textblock>461(g)(2).</textblock>
    <textblock>If a payment of points is deductible by the borrower</textblock>

    <textblock>Allocation respected in certain small transactions.</textblock>
    <textblock>[Reserved]</textblock>

    <textblock>Pro rata prepayments.</textblock>
    <textblock>Accrued but unpaid interest is</textblock>
    <textblock>allocated to a pro rata prepayment under rules similar to those</textblock>
    <textblock>for allocating accrued but unpaid original issue discount to a</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata prepayment under §1.1275-2(f). For purposes of the</textblock>
    <textblock>preceding sentence, a pro rata prepayment is a payment that is</textblock>
    <textblock>made prior to maturity that_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Is not made pursuant to the contract's payment schedule;</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Results in a substantially pro rata reduction of each</textblock>
    <textblock>payment remaining to be paid on the contract.</textblock>
