    <textblock>3. Control pain that interferes with coughing and deep breathing during the immediate postoperative period by using systemic analgesia,</textblock>
    <textblock>309,652</textblock>
    <textblock>including patient-controlled analgesia,</textblock>
    <textblock>310-312</textblock>

    <textblock>313-315</textblock>
    <textblock>CATEGORY IB</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Use an incentive spirometer or intermittent positive pressure breathing, perform chest physiotherapy on patients at high risk of developing postoperative pneumonia.</textblock>

    <textblock>1. Vaccination of Patients</textblock>
    <textblock>Vaccinate patients at high risk for complications of pneumococcal infections with pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine. High-risk patients include persons "65 years old; adults with chronic cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, alcoholism, cirrhosis, or cerebrospinal fluid leaks; and children and adults with immunosuppression, functional or anatomic asplenia, or HIV infection.</textblock>

    <textblock>A. Staff Education</textblock>
    <textblock>Educate (1) physicians and nurses to heighten their suspicion for cases of nosocomial Legionnaires' disease and to use appropriate methods for its diagnosis, and (2) patient-care, infection-control, and engineering personnel about measures to control nosocomial legionellosis.</textblock>
