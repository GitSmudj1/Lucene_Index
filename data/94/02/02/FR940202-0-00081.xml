    <textblock>(ii)</textblock>
    <textblock>Example.</textblock>
    <textblock>The following example illustrates the rule in</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph (e)(4)(i) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>Example. Variable rate debt instrument that provides for a</textblock>
    <textblock>single fixed rate_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>Facts.</textblock>
    <textblock>On January 1, 1995, X purchases at</textblock>
    <textblock>original issue, for $100,000, a variable rate debt instrument</textblock>
    <textblock>that matures on January 1, 2001, and that has a stated principal</textblock>
    <textblock>amount of $100,000. The debt instrument provides for payments of</textblock>
    <textblock>interest on January 1 of each year, beginning on January 1, 1996.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the first 4 years, the interest rate is 4 percent, compounded</textblock>
    <textblock>annually, and for the last 2 years the interest rate is the value</textblock>
    <textblock>of 1-year LIBOR, as of the payment date, plus 200 basis points.</textblock>
    <textblock>On January 1, 1995, the value of 1-year LIBOR is 2 percent,</textblock>
    <textblock>compounded annually. In addition, assume that on January 1,</textblock>
    <textblock>1995, the variable rate debt instrument has approximately the</textblock>
    <textblock>same fair market value as an otherwise identical debt instrument</textblock>
    <textblock>that provides for an interest rate equal to the value of 1-year</textblock>
    <textblock>LIBOR, as of the payment date, for the first 4 years.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii)</textblock>
    <textblock>Equivalent fixed rate debt instrument.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under paragraph</textblock>
    <textblock>(e)(4)(i) of this section, for purposes of paragraphs (e)(3)(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>through (e)(3)(iii) of this section, the variable rate debt</textblock>
    <textblock>instrument is treated as if it provided for an interest rate</textblock>
    <textblock>equal to the value of 1-year LIBOR, as of the payment date, for</textblock>
    <textblock>the first 4 years. Under paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section,</textblock>
    <textblock>the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument for the variable rate</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument is a 6-year debt instrument that has an issue</textblock>
    <textblock>price and stated principal amount of $100,000. The equivalent</textblock>
    <textblock>fixed rate debt instrument provides for interest payments of</textblock>
    <textblock>$2,000 for the first 4 years and $4,000 for the last 2 years.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii)</textblock>
    <textblock>Accrual of OID and qualified stated interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง1.1273-1, the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument has OID of</textblock>
    <textblock>$4,000 because a portion (200 basis points) of each interest</textblock>
    <textblock>payment in the last 2 years is not a qualified stated interest</textblock>
    <textblock>payment. The $4,000 of OID is allocable over the 6-year term of</textblock>
    <textblock>the debt instrument under ยง1.1272-1. Under paragraph (e)(3)(iv)</textblock>
    <textblock>of this section, the difference between the $4,000 payment made</textblock>
    <textblock>in the first 4 years and the $2,000 payment assumed to be made on</textblock>
    <textblock>the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument in those years is an</textblock>
    <textblock>adjustment to qualified stated interest. In addition, any</textblock>
    <textblock>difference between the amount actually paid in each of the last 2</textblock>
    <textblock>years and the $4,000 payment assumed to be made on the equivalent</textblock>
    <textblock>fixed rate debt instrument is an adjustment to qualified stated</textblock>
    <textblock>interest.</textblock>
    <textblock>(f)</textblock>
    <textblock>Special rule for certain reset bonds.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notwithstanding</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraph (e) of this section, this paragraph (f) provides a</textblock>
    <textblock>special rule for a variable rate debt instrument that provides</textblock>
    <textblock>for stated interest at a fixed rate for an initial interval, and</textblock>
    <textblock>provides that on the date immediately following the end of the</textblock>
    <textblock>initial interval (the effective date) the stated interest rate</textblock>
    <textblock>will be a rate determined under a procedure (such as an auction</textblock>
    <textblock>procedure) so that the fair market value of the instrument on the</textblock>
    <textblock>effective date will be a fixed amount (the reset value). Solely</textblock>
    <textblock>for purposes of calculating the accrual of OID, the variable rate</textblock>
    <textblock>debt instrument is treated as_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Maturing on the date immediately preceding the effective</textblock>
    <textblock>date for an amount equal to the reset value; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Reissued on the effective date for an amount equal to</textblock>
    <textblock>the reset value.</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง1.1275-6T</textblock>
    <textblock>[Removed]</textblock>
    <textblock>Par. 16.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 1.1275-6T is removed as of February 2, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง1.6050H-2T</textblock>
    <textblock>[Removed]</textblock>
    <textblock>Par. 17.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 1.6050H-2T is removed as of February 2, 1994.</textblock>
