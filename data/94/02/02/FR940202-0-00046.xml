    <textblock>(ii)</textblock>
    <textblock>Method of accounting for interest on contracts subject</textblock>
    <textblock>to section 483.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any stated or unstated interest on a contract</textblock>
    <textblock>subject to section 483 is taken into account by a taxpayer under</textblock>
    <textblock>the taxpayer's regular method of accounting (e.g., an accrual</textblock>
    <textblock>method or the cash receipts and disbursements method). See</textblock>
    <textblock>§§1.446-1, 1.451-1, and 1.461-1. For purposes of the preceding</textblock>
    <textblock>sentence, the amount of interest (including unstated interest)</textblock>
    <textblock>allocable to a payment under a contract to which section 483</textblock>
    <textblock>applies is determined under §1.446-2(e).</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Definitions</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Deferred payments.</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of the</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations under section 483, a deferred payment means any</textblock>
    <textblock>payment that constitutes all or a part of the sales price (as</textblock>
    <textblock>defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section), and that is due</textblock>
    <textblock>more than 6 months after the date of the sale or exchange.</textblock>
    <textblock>Except as provided in section 483(c)(2) (relating to the</textblock>
    <textblock>treatment of a debt instrument of the purchaser), a payment may</textblock>
    <textblock>be made in the form of cash, stock or securities, or other</textblock>
    <textblock>property.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Sales price.</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of section 483, the sales</textblock>
    <textblock>price for any sale or exchange is the sum of the amount due under</textblock>
    <textblock>the contract (other than stated interest) and the amount of any</textblock>
    <textblock>liability included in the amount realized from the sale or</textblock>
    <textblock>exchange. See §1.1001-2. Thus, the sales price for any sale or</textblock>
    <textblock>exchange includes any amount of unstated interest under the</textblock>
    <textblock>contract.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c)</textblock>
    <textblock>Exceptions to and limitations on the application of</textblock>
    <textblock>section 483</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>

    <textblock>Sections 483(d), 1274(c)(4), and</textblock>
    <textblock>1275(b) contain exceptions to and limitations on the application</textblock>
    <textblock>of section 483.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Sales price of $3,000 or less.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 483(d)(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>applies only if it can be determined at the time of the sale or</textblock>
    <textblock>exchange that the sales price cannot exceed $3,000, regardless of</textblock>
    <textblock>whether the sales price eventually paid for the property is less</textblock>
    <textblock>than $3,000.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Other exceptions and limitations</textblock>
    <textblock>_(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>Certain transfers</textblock>
    <textblock>subject to section 1041.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 483 does not apply to any</textblock>
    <textblock>transfer of property subject to section 1041 (relating to</textblock>
    <textblock>transfers of property between spouses or incident to divorce).</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii)</textblock>
    <textblock>Treatment of certain obligees.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 483 does not</textblock>
    <textblock>apply to an obligee under a contract for the sale or exchange of</textblock>
    <textblock>personal use property (within the meaning of section 1275(b)(3))</textblock>
    <textblock>in the hands of the obligor and that evidences a below-market</textblock>

    <textblock>7872(c)(1).</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv)</textblock>
    <textblock>Transactions involving certain annuity contracts.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 483 does not apply to any payment under an annuity</textblock>
    <textblock>contract described in section 1275(a)(1)(B) (relating to annuity</textblock>
    <textblock>contracts excluded from the definition of debt instrument).</textblock>
    <textblock>(v)</textblock>
    <textblock>Options.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 483 does not apply to any payment</textblock>
    <textblock>under an option to buy or sell property.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d)</textblock>
    <textblock>Assumptions.</textblock>
    <textblock>If a debt instrument is assumed, or</textblock>
    <textblock>property is taken subject to a debt instrument, in connection</textblock>
    <textblock>with a sale or exchange of property, the debt instrument is</textblock>
    <textblock>treated for purposes of section 483 in a manner consistent with</textblock>
    <textblock>the rules of §1.1274-5.</textblock>
