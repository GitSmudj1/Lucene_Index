    <textblock>Take notice that on January 21, 1994, Blue Lake Gas Storage Company (Blue Lake) tendered for filing as part of its FERC Gas Tariff, First Revised Volume No. 1, Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 5.</textblock>
    <textblock>Blue Lake states that Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 5 inserts the portion of the definition under footnote No. 3 which was inadvertently omitted when Blue Lake filed its First Revised Sheet No. 5. In all other respects Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 5 is the same as First Revised Sheet No. 5 which was accepted in the above captioned Dockets by the Commission in a January 12, 1994 Order. Blue Lake requests that October 1, 1993, the same date that First Revised Sheet No. 5 became effective, also be the effective date for Substitute First Revised Sheet No. 5.</textblock>
    <textblock>Blue Lake states that copies of the filing were served upon Blue Lake's jurisdictional customer.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person desiring to protest said filing should file a protest with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 825 North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426, in accordance with 18 CFR 385.211 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations. All such protests should be filed on or before February 3, 1994. Protests will be considered by the Commission in determining the appropriate action to be taken, but will not serve to make protestants parties to the proceeding. Copies of this filing are on file with the Commission and are available for public information in the public reference room.</textblock>
