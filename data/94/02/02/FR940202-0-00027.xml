    <textblock>Section 1.6662-6T is added to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§1.6662-6T␣Transactions between persons described in section 482 and net section 482 transfer price adjustments.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>In general</textblock>
    <textblock>_(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Purpose and scope.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to section 6662(e) a penalty is imposed on any underpayment attributable to a substantial valuation misstatement pertaining to either a transaction between persons described in section 482 (the transactional penalty) or a net section 482 transfer price adjustment (the net adjustment penalty). The penalty is equal to 20 percent of the underpayment of tax attributable to that substantial valuation misstatement. Pursuant to section 6662(h) the penalty is increased to 40 percent of the underpayment in the case of a gross valuation misstatement with respect to either penalty. Paragraph (b) of this section provides specific rules related to the transactional penalty. Paragraph (c) of this section provides specific rules related to the net adjustment penalty, and paragraph (d) of this section describes amounts that will be excluded for purposes of calculating the net adjustment penalty. Paragraph (e) of this section sets forth special rules in the case of carrybacks and carryovers. Paragraph (f) of this section provides coordination rules between penalties. Paragraph (g) of this section provides the effective date of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Reported results.</textblock>
    <textblock>Whether an underpayment is attributable to a substantial or gross valuation misstatement must be determined from the results of controlled transactions that are reported on an income tax return, regardless of whether the amount reported differs from the transaction price initially reflected in the taxpayer's books and records. The results of controlled transactions that are reported on an amended return will be used only if the amended return is filed before the Internal Revenue Service has contacted the taxpayer regarding the corresponding original return. A written statement furnished by a taxpayer subject to the Coordinated Examination Program will be considered an amended return for purposes of this section if it satisfies either the requirements of a qualified amended return for purposes of §1.6664-2(c)(3) or such requirements as the Commissioner may prescribe by revenue procedure. In the case of a taxpayer that is a member of a consolidated group, the rules of this paragraph (a)(2) apply to the consolidated income tax return of the group.</textblock>

    <textblock>For purposes of this section, the terms used in these regulations shall have the same meaning as identical terms used in regulations under section 482.</textblock>
