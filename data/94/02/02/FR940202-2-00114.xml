    <textblock>III. Prevention and Control Measures</textblock>
    <textblock>Vaccination of persons at high risk for complications of influenza is currently the most effective measure for reducing the impact of influenza, and should be done before the influenza season each year. Such persons include those "65 years of age; those in long-term-care units; those with chronic disorders of the pulmonary or cardiovascular systems, those with diabetes mellitus, renal dysfunction, hemoglobinopathies, musculo-skeletal disorders, or immunosuppression; and children 6 months-18 years of age who are receiving long-term aspirin therapy.</textblock>
    <textblock>564,579-581</textblock>
    <textblock>When high vaccination rates are achieved in closed or semi-closed settings, the risk of outbreaks is reduced because of induction of herd immunity.</textblock>
    <textblock>582,583</textblock>
    <textblock>When an institutional outbreak is due to influenza A, antiviral agents may be used both for treatment of ill persons and as prophylaxis for others.</textblock>
    <textblock>584</textblock>
    <textblock>Two related antiviral agents, amantadine hydrochloride and rimantadine hydrochloride, are effective against influenza-A, but not influenza-B, virus.</textblock>
    <textblock>493,585-587</textblock>
    <textblock>These agents can be used (1) for short-term prophylaxis after late vaccination of high-risk persons; (2) as prophylaxis for persons for whom vaccination is contraindicated; (3) as prophylaxis for immunocompromised persons who may not produce protective levels of antibody in response to vaccination; (4) for prophylaxis for unvaccinated healthcare workers who provide care to high-risk patients, either for the duration of influenza activity in the community or until immunity develops after vaccination; and (5) when vaccine strains do not closely match the epidemic viral strain.</textblock>
    <textblock>584</textblock>
    <textblock>Amantadine has been available in the United States for many years; rimantadine has just recently been approved for use. Both drugs protect against all naturally-occurring strains of type A influenza virus; thus, antigenic changes in the virus that may reduce vaccine efficacy do not alter the effectiveness of amantadine or rimantadine. Both are 70-90% effective in preventing illness if taken before exposure to influenza A virus.</textblock>
    <textblock>585,588</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, they lessen the severity and duration of illness due to influenza A when administered within 24-48 hours after onset of symptoms.</textblock>
    <textblock>589,590</textblock>
    <textblock>Amantadine can limit nosocomial spread of influenza A if it is administered to all or most patients at the time influenza is recognized in a facility.</textblock>
    <textblock>562,591,592</textblock>
    <textblock>Side effects from amantadine are more common than those from rimantadine; they include mild and transitory nervousness, insomnia, impaired concentration, mood changes, light-headedness, anorexia, and nausea. These symptoms have been reported in 5-10% of healthy young adults receiving 200 mg of the drug per day.</textblock>
    <textblock>493,585</textblock>
    <textblock>In the elderly, the symptoms may be more severe; in addition, dizziness and ataxia are more common in this age group.</textblock>
    <textblock>593,594</textblock>
    <textblock>Thus, it is recommended that for persons "65 years of age and/or those who have renal insufficiency, amantadine dosage should be reduced to &gt;100 mg per day. Further reductions are recommended on the basis of the patient's creatinine clearance.</textblock>
    <textblock>595,596</textblock>
    <textblock>However, because recommended dosages based on creatinine clearance may provide only a rough estimate of the optimal dose for a given patient,</textblock>
    <textblock>597</textblock>
    <textblock>such persons should be carefully observed so that adverse reactions can be recognized promptly and the dose further reduced or the drug discontinued, if necessary.</textblock>
    <textblock>Emergence of amantadine- and rimantadine-resistant strains of influenza A virus has been observed in persons who receive these drugs for treatment of the infection.</textblock>
    <textblock>598,599</textblock>
    <textblock>Because of the potential risk of transmission of resistant viral strains to close contacts of persons receiving amantadine or rimantadine for treatment,</textblock>
    <textblock>599,600</textblock>
    <textblock>to the extent possible, infected persons taking either drug should avoid contact with others during treatment and for 2 days after discontinuing treatment.</textblock>
    <textblock>600,601</textblock>
    <textblock>This is particularly important if the contacts are uninfected persons taking amantadine or rimantadine for prophylaxis.</textblock>
    <textblock>600,602</textblock>
    <textblock>Vaccination of high-risk patients and of hospital personnel before the influenza season is the primary focus of efforts to prevent and control nosocomial influenza.</textblock>
    <textblock>581,584,603</textblock>
    <textblock>The decision to use amantadine or rimantadine as an adjunct to vaccination in the prevention and control of nosocomial influenza is based in part on results of virologic and epidemiologic surveillance in the hospital and the community. When outbreaks of influenza A occur in a hospital, and antiviral prophylaxis of high-risk persons and treatment of cases is undertaken, administration of amantadine or rimantadine is begun as early in the outbreak as possible to reduce transmission.</textblock>
    <textblock>562,584,591,602</textblock>
    <textblock>Measures other than vaccination and chemoprophylaxis with amantadine or rimantadine have been recommended for control of nosocomial influenza outbreaks. Because influenza can be transmitted during contact with an infected person, contact-isolation precautions, such as placing a patient symptomatic with influenza in a private room, cohorting of patients with influenza, and masking upon entering a room with persons with influenza have been recommended.</textblock>
    <textblock>213</textblock>
    <textblock>Handwashing, gloving, and gowning by healthcare workers during the period of viral shedding by patients have also been recommended, but the exact role of these measures in preventing influenza transmission remains to be elucidated.</textblock>
    <textblock>213,561,604</textblock>
    <textblock>Although influenza can be transmitted via the airborne route, the efficacy of placing infected persons in rooms with negative pressure in relation to their immediate environment has not been assessed. In addition, this measure may be impractical during institutional outbreaks that occur in the midst of a community epidemic of influenza because many newly admitted patients and healthcare workers may be infected with the virus; thus, the hospital would face the logistical problem of accommodating all ill persons in rooms with special ventilation. Although controlled studies are not available to measure their effectiveness, the following additional measures have been recommended for consideration, particularly during severe outbreaks: (1) Curtailment or elimination of elective admissions, both medical and surgical; (2) restriction of cardiovascular and pulmonary surgery; (3) restriction of hospital visitors, especially those with acute respiratory illnesses; and (4) work restriction for healthcare workers with acute respiratory illness.</textblock>
