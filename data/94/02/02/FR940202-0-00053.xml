    <textblock>Contingencies that are likely to occur</textblock>
    <textblock>_(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>Contingency taken into account.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notwithstanding the rule in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, if, based on all the facts and circumstances as of the issue date, it is more likely than not that the debt instrument's stated payment schedule will not occur, then the yield and maturity of the debt instrument are computed based on the payment schedule most likely to occur.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii)</textblock>
    <textblock>Mandatory sinking fund provision.</textblock>
    <textblock>Paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section does not apply to a mandatory sinking fund provision if the use and terms of the provision meet reasonable commercial standards. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a mandatory sinking fund provision is a provision that requires the issuer to redeem a certain amount of debt instruments in an issue prior to maturity, provided that the debt instruments actually redeemed are chosen by lot or purchased by the issuer either in the open market or pursuant to an offer made to all holders (with any proration determined by lot), and provided that on the issue date the specific debt instruments that will be redeemed on any date prior to maturity cannot be identified.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4)</textblock>
    <textblock>Consistency rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The payment schedule determined by the issuer under paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section is binding on all holders of the debt instrument. However, the issuer's determination is not binding on a holder that explicitly discloses that its determination of the yield and maturity of the debt instrument is different from the issuer's determination. Unless otherwise prescribed by the Commissioner, the disclosure must be made on a statement attached to the holder's timely filed Federal income tax return for the taxable year that includes the acquisition date of the debt instrument. See ยง1.1275-2(e) for rules relating to the issuer's obligation to disclose certain information to holders.</textblock>
    <textblock>(5)</textblock>
    <textblock>Treatment of certain options.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notwithstanding paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section, the rules of this paragraph (c)(5) determine the yield and maturity of a debt instrument that provides the holder or issuer with an unconditional option or options, exercisable on one or more dates during the term of the debt instrument, that, if exercised, require payments to be made on the debt instrument under an alternative payment schedule or schedules (e.g., an option to extend or an option to call a debt instrument at a fixed premium). Under this paragraph (c)(5), an issuer will be deemed to exercise or not exercise an option or combination of options in a manner that minimizes the yield on the debt instrument, and a holder will be deemed to exercise or not exercise an option or combination of options in a manner that maximizes the yield on the debt instrument. If both the issuer and the holder have options, the rules of this paragraph (c)(5) are applied to the options in the order that they may be exercised. Thus, the deemed exercise of one option may eliminate other options that are later in time. See</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 5</textblock>
    <textblock>through</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 8</textblock>
    <textblock>in paragraph (j) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(6)</textblock>
    <textblock>Subsequent adjustments.</textblock>
    <textblock>If a contingency described in this paragraph (c) (including the exercise of an option described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section) actually occurs or does not occur, contrary to the assumption made pursuant to this paragraph (c) (a change in circumstances), then, solely for purposes of the accrual of OID, the yield and maturity of the debt instrument are redetermined by treating the debt instrument as reissued on the date of the change in circumstances for an amount equal to its adjusted issue price on that date. See</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 5</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 7</textblock>
    <textblock>in paragraph (j) of this section. If, however, the change in circumstances results in a substantially contemporaneous pro rata prepayment as defined in ยง1.1275-2(f)(2) (e.g., because a partial put or call option treated under paragraph (c)(5) of this section as not exercised is, in fact, exercised), the pro rata prepayment is treated as a payment in retirement of a portion of the debt instrument, which may result in gain or loss to the holder. See</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 6</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>Example 8</textblock>
    <textblock>in paragraph (j) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d)</textblock>
    <textblock>Certain debt instruments that provide for principal payments uncertain as to time.</textblock>
    <textblock>The yield of a debt instrument with principal payments that are fixed in total amount but that are uncertain as to time (such as a demand loan) is the stated interest rate if the issue price of the instrument is equal to the stated principal amount and interest is paid or compounded at a fixed rate over the entire term of the debt instrument at intervals of 1 year or less.</textblock>
