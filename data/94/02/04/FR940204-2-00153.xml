    <textblock>In the Matter of Airspect, Inc.</textblock>
    <textblock>Order No. 93-37 (12/21/93)</textblock>
    <textblock>Interlocutory Appeal of Right Dismissed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Complainant's interlocutory appeal of the law judge's decision to accept Respondent's late-filed answer did not meet the requirements for an interlocutory appeal of right pursuant to 14 CFR 13.219(c). The law judge's decision did not violate 14 CFR 13.205(b) which provides a basis for an interlocutory appeals of right when a law judge exceeds his powers. The Administrator dismissed Complainant's interlocutory appeal of right, and remanded the case of the law judge for further proceedings.</textblock>
    <textblock>Commercial Reporting Services of the Administrator's Civil Penalty Decisions and Orders</textblock>
    <textblock>In June, 1991, as a public service, the FAA began releasing to commercial publishers the Administrator's decisions and orders in civil penalty cases.
