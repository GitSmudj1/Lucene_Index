The authority to approve service fellowship plans and exceptions thereto has not been redelegated to FDA. FDA is additionally amending ยง5.26 to reflect organizational changes within the centers, and to add the Deputy Director for Regulations and Policy, Center for Devices and Radiological Health, the Office Directors, Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and the Director, Office of Human Resources Management, Office of Management Systems, to those already delegated authority.</textblock>
