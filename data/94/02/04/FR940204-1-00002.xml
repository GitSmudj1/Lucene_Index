    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to amend its Electric Vehicle Research and Development Program to provide new factors for calculating the equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy of electric vehicles. The equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy value is intended to be used in calculating the corporate average fuel economy pursuant to regulations prescribed by the Environmental Protection Agency. DOE is required to develop the procedure pursuant to section 503(a)(3) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, as amended.</textblock>
