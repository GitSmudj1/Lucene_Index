    <textblock>Behren's silverspot butterfly is similar in appearance to two other</textblock>
    <textblock>subspecies of</textblock>
    <textblock>Speyeria zerene</textblock>
    <textblock>(Hammond 1980, Howe 1975, McCorkle and</textblock>
    <textblock>Hammond 1988). The threatened Oregon silverspot butterfly (</textblock>
    <textblock>Speyeria</textblock>
    <textblock>zerene hippolyta</textblock>
    <textblock>) has lighter basal suffusion on the upper sides of the</textblock>
    <textblock>wings than Behren's silverspot butterfly. Another related taxon, the</textblock>
    <textblock>endangered Myrtle's silverspot butterfly (</textblock>
    <textblock>Speyeria zerene myrtleae</textblock>
    <textblock>), is</textblock>
    <textblock>larger in size and also lighter in color than</textblock>
    <textblock>Speyeria zerene behrensii.</textblock>
    <textblock>Behren's silverspot butterfly inhabits coastal terrace prairie</textblock>
    <textblock>habitat. The life history of Behren's silverspot butterfly is similar</textblock>
    <textblock>to the callippe silverspot butterfly. The females lay their eggs in the</textblock>
    <textblock>debris and dried stems of the larval foodplant, violet (</textblock>
    <textblock>Viola adunca</textblock>
    <textblock>)</textblock>
    <textblock>(McCorkle 1980, McCorkle and Hammond 1988). Upon hatching, the</textblock>
    <textblock>caterpillars wander a short distance and spin a silk pad upon which they</textblock>
    <textblock>pass the fall and winter. The larvae are dark-colored with many</textblock>
    <textblock>branching sharp spines on the back. The caterpillars immediately seek</textblock>
    <textblock>out the foodplant upon termination of diapause in the spring. Each</textblock>
    <textblock>larva then forms a pupa within a chamber of leaves that they have drawn</textblock>
    <textblock>together with silk. The adults emerge in about 2 weeks and live for</textblock>
    <textblock>approximately 3 weeks. Depending upon environmental conditions, the</textblock>
    <textblock>flight period of this single brooded butterfly ranges from July to</textblock>
    <textblock>August. Adult males patrol open areas in search of newly emerged</textblock>
    <textblock>females.</textblock>
    <textblock>The historic range of Behren's silverspot butterfly extends from</textblock>
    <textblock>the mouth of the Russian River in Sonoma County northward along the</textblock>
    <textblock>immediate coast to southern Mendocino County in the vicinity of Point</textblock>
    <textblock>Arena (Mattoon,</textblock>
    <textblock>in litt</textblock>
    <textblock>., 1989). The six historic populations were</textblock>
    <textblock>known to occur in coastal terrace prairie and adjacent habitats. The</textblock>
    <textblock>single extant population, which was recently discovered, occurs on</textblock>
    <textblock>privately owned land near Point Arena in Mendocino County.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Alameda whipsnake (</textblock>
    <textblock>Masticophis lateralis euryxanthus</textblock>
    <textblock>) is a</textblock>
    <textblock>member of the Colubridae family (Morey and Bioassay 1988). It was</textblock>
    <textblock>described by William Reimer (1954) from a specimen collected in Berkeley</textblock>
    <textblock>Hills, Alameda County, California. The common name ``Alameda whipsnake''</textblock>
    <textblock>is utilized in this proposed rule instead of ``Alameda striped racer''</textblock>
    <textblock>that was used in the November 21, 1991, Animal Notice of Review (56 FR</textblock>
    <textblock>58804). ``Whipsnake'' is a widely recognized common name for other</textblock>
    <textblock>members of the genus</textblock>
    <textblock>Masticophis</textblock>
    <textblock>(Stebbins 1985). The Alameda whipsnake</textblock>
    <textblock>is a slender, fast moving diurnal snake with a narrow neck and a</textblock>
    <textblock>relatively broad head with large eyes. The dorsal surface is colored</textblock>
    <textblock>sooty black or dark brown with a distinct yellow-orange stripe down each</textblock>
    <textblock>side. The anterior portions of the ventral surface are orange-rufous</textblock>
    <textblock>colored, the midsection is cream colored, and the posterior and tail are</textblock>
    <textblock>pinkish. The adults reach a length of 91 to 122 centimeters (3 to 4</textblock>
    <textblock>feet). This subspecies is distinguished from the more common California</textblock>
    <textblock>whipsnake (</textblock>
    <textblock>M. l. lateralis</textblock>
    <textblock>) by its comparatively wide orange stripes,</textblock>
    <textblock>which run laterally down each side.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Alameda whipsnake inhabits the inner coast range in western and</textblock>
    <textblock>central Contra Costa and Alameda Counties (McGinnis 1992). One of the</textblock>
    <textblock>two major populations extends from approximately El Sorbante south to</textblock>
    <textblock>about Hayward. The second is found from Clayton/Mount Diablo southeast</textblock>
    <textblock>to the Vasco Road area. It occurs mostly on privately owned land, but</textblock>
    <textblock>also occurs on State and county land.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Alameda whipsnake usually is found in northern coastal scrub or</textblock>
    <textblock>chaparral, but it also may occur in adjacent habitats. This extremely</textblock>
    <textblock>fast-moving, lizard-eating specialist holds its head high off the ground</textblock>
    <textblock>in a cobra-like manner to peer over grass or rocks at potential prey.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Alameda whipsnake has been found to exhibit territorial behavior,</textblock>
    <textblock>possessing home ranges varying in size from 2 to 8.7 hectares (5.0 to</textblock>
    <textblock>21.5 acres). Some animals have been recorded to have moved over 1 mile</textblock>
    <textblock>while traversing their areas (McGinnis 1992). The life history of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Alameda whipsnake is not well understood (Goldberg 1975, Hammerson</textblock>
    <textblock>1978).</textblock>
    <textblock>A proposed rule to list the callippe silverspot butterfly as</textblock>
    <textblock>endangered with critical habitat was published on July 3, 1978 (43 FR</textblock>
    <textblock>28938). The critical habitat portion of that proposal was withdrawn by</textblock>
    <textblock>the Service on March 6, 1979 (44 FR 12382), because of procedural and</textblock>
    <textblock>other substantive changes in the Endangered Species Act by the 1978</textblock>
    <textblock>amendments. The Service again published a proposed rule to designate</textblock>
    <textblock>critical habitat for the callippe silverspot butterfly on March 28, 1980</textblock>
    <textblock>(45 FR 20503). The proposed rule to list the callippe silverspot</textblock>
    <textblock>butterfly was withdrawn on September 30, 1980 (45 FR 64607), because the</textblock>
    <textblock>1978 Endangered Species Act amendments required that the final rule for</textblock>
    <textblock>the species be completed within 2 years after the date of publication</textblock>
    <textblock>proposing to list it as endangered or threatened.</textblock>
    <textblock>The callippe silverspot butterfly was listed as a category 2</textblock>
    <textblock>candidate species in the May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664), and January 6, 1989</textblock>
    <textblock>(54 FR 554), Animal Notices of Review. This category includes species</textblock>
    <textblock>that may be appropriate to list as endangered or threatened, but for</textblock>
    <textblock>which conclusive data on their biological vulnerability is not currently</textblock>
    <textblock>available to support proposed rules. The species was listed as a</textblock>
    <textblock>category 1 candidate species in the November 21, 1991 (56 FR 58804),</textblock>
    <textblock>Animal Notice of Review because of increased threats from overcollecting</textblock>
    <textblock>(see Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affecting the Species''</textblock>
    <textblock>section). This category includes taxa for which the Service has on file</textblock>
    <textblock>enough substantial information on biological vulnerability and threats</textblock>
    <textblock>to propose listing them as endangered or threatened.</textblock>
