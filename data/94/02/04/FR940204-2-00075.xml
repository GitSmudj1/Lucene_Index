    <textblock>quality, water quantity, air quality and vegetation.</textblock>

    <textblock>United States. EPA commented that all three new</textblock>
    <textblock>design alternatives presented in the draft supplemental</textblock>
    <textblock>EIS would have less adverse environmental impact, and</textblock>
    <textblock>less adverse impact on parks and open space, than the</textblock>
    <textblock>alternative (Scheme Z) presented in the 1991 final</textblock>

    <textblock>Hillsborough County, NH.</textblock>
    <textblock>Summary:</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA had environmental objections to the proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>action due to (1) significant degradation of waters of</textblock>
    <textblock>the United States, including wetlands; (2) potential</textblock>
    <textblock>adverse impacts to water supply resources; and (3) the</textblock>
    <textblock>lack of specific mitigation to offset the impacts to</textblock>
    <textblock>waters of the U.S. and drinking water supplies. EPA</textblock>
    <textblock>stated that the proposed action is a likely candidate</textblock>
    <textblock>for action under EPA's Section 404 (c) authority</textblock>
    <textblock>and recommended that the Corps of Engineers deny</textblock>
    <textblock>the Section 404 permit application.</textblock>
