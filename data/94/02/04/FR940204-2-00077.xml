    <textblock>Abstract:</textblock>
    <textblock>In compliance with section 6(e) of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), owners of PCB transformers must keep records on unit use, inspection and corrective actions for leaks. These records must be maintained for at least three years after disposing of the transformer. Owners of PCB transformers must also report any fire-related incidents immediately to the National Response Center. EPA conducts periodic inspections of facilities operating PCB transformers. The inspections are used to generate reports, and to ensure compliance with TSCA.</textblock>
