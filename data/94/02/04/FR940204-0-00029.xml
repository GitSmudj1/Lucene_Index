    <textblock>ADEM submitted SIP revisions on June 19, 1985, September 3, 1985, and September 15, 1985, modifying the particulate control strategy for Etowah County. The State requested that Etowah County be redesignated to attainment for TSP. EPA has more recently adopted a particulate matter standard based on particles with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 10 microns (PM10). Under the 1990 Amendments, Etowah County does not have to redesignate to attainment for TSP, and therefore, the EPA is not acting on the request to redesignate.</textblock>
    <textblock>The following is a list of the revisions made to Chapter 4 to control particulate emissions. These revisions are being approved in today's action.</textblock>
    <textblock>335-3-4-.17(1)␣</textblock>
    <textblock>Visible Emissions from roof monitors or other openings in the basic oxygen furnace (BOF) building, other than water mist or vapor, shall not exceed a shade or density greater than twenty percent (20%) opacity as determined on a three (3) minute rolling average. Compliance shall be determined by using the procedures specified at 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Method 9 excluding section 2.5.</textblock>
    <textblock>335-3-4-.17(2)␣</textblock>
    <textblock>All paved roads shall be vacuum swept or flushed of surface material every third consecutive day. The vacuum</textblock>
    <textblock>sweeper shall have a minimum blower capacity of 12,000 cfm and the flushing machine shall dispense water at the rate of 0.32 gal/yd.2</textblock>
    <textblock>335-3-4-.17(3)␣</textblock>
    <textblock>Paved parking areas shall be vacuum swept or flushed of surface material every calendar quarter. The vacuum sweeper shall have a minimum blower capacity of 12,000 cfm and the flushing machine shall dispense water at the rate of 0.32 gal/yd.2</textblock>
    <textblock>335-3-4-.17(4)␣</textblock>
    <textblock>Paved road or area flushing specified in sections 335-3-4-.17(2) and 335-3-4-.17(3) is not required when the temperature is below 32</textblock>
    <textblock>○F. Paved road or area cleaning is not required when precipitation during the previous 24-hour period has exceeded 0.01 inches.</textblock>
    <textblock>335-3-4-.17(5)␣</textblock>
    <textblock>Unpaved roads, traffic areas in the slag storage area, and traffic areas in other material storage areas shall be treated with petroleum resin, asphalt emulsion, or equivalent dust suppressant on a quarterly or more frequent basis as determined by the Director.</textblock>
