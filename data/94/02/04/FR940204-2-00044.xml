    <textblock>5. Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company</textblock>
    <textblock>[Docket No. ER94-916-000]</textblock>
    <textblock>Take notice that on January 21, 1994, Southern Indiana Gas and Electric Company (Southern Indiana) tendered a Letter Agreement and request for term extension of its rate schedule FPC-29 under which it sells standby electrical power to Alcoa Generating Corporation (AGC). The change is for a one (1) year term extension only and will result in no rate increase or decrease or revenue change. Southern Indiana has requested a waiver of the minimum 60 day notice requirement. The only affected customer is the purchaser, AGC. Southern Indiana and AGC are parties to a written Letter Agreement executed on August 1, 1991, for the service, to a written Letter Agreement for extension of the service dated January 13, 1993, and a written Letter Agreement for a further extension of the term of the service for one year from January 12, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>The reason for the Letter Agreement extending the term is to give the parties additional time to negotiate and file a long term rate. The Term Extension Agreement is therefore mutually beneficial.</textblock>
    <textblock>A copy of the filing has been served upon AGC.</textblock>
