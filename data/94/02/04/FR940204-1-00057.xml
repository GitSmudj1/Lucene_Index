    <textblock>II. This Action</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Analysis of State Submission</textblock>
    <textblock>As noted above, section 110(k)(4) of the CAA allows EPA to accept a commitment from states to adopt portions of SIPs rather than the SIP itself. For example, EPA may, in certain cases, accept a commitment from states to adopt NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>RACT rules rather than the NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>RACT rule itself. The NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>Supplement to the General Preamble (57 FR 55623) and the aforementioned memorandums of July 22, 1992, and September 16, 1992, outline EPA's criteria for acceptability of committal SIPs for the NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>RACT rules. The following is a statement of the criteria and an analysis of how Missouri's submittal meets these criteria.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The State must provide a description of the reason for the committal SIP versus a full SIP submittal.</textblock>
    <textblock>A discussion of the reasoning behind the State's submission of an NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>RACT committal SIP is provided on page 2 of the SIP submission. Missouri's decision to submit an NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>RACT committal SIP instead of a full SIP submittal was twofold. First, urban airshed modeling (UAM) will identify the role of NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>emissions in ozone formation but the modeling exercise will not be completed until 1994, consistent with the UAM submission date. Since it was not clear to the Missouri Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) on November 15, 1992, that NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>emission reductions would be effective in reducing ozone concentrations, it was not practical for Missouri to submit NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>RACT regulations at that time. Secondly, EPA failed to provide states with NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>RACT guidance by November 15, 1992, making the development of a full NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>RACT SIP by that date an ambiguous target for Missouri.</textblock>
    <textblock>However, in the committal SIP, Missouri has committed to submit NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>RACT regulations by October 31, 1994, unless St. Louis qualifies for an exemption pursuant to section 182(f) of the Act. Missouri is also aware that the Act requires NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>RACT to be implemented by May 1995. The committal SIP schedule is consistent with this requirement.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. The State must provide documentation that credible photochemical grid modeling is not available or that such modeling did not consider the effects of NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>reductions.</textblock>
    <textblock>This documentation is provided on page 2 of the committal SIP. According to MDNR, UAM was previously conducted in St. Louis in 1985; however, at that time the UAM was not used to focus on the effect of NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>control strategies in St. Louis. The only UAM exercise available to examine NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>emissions will be the current exercise which is being conducted pursuant to the requirements of section 182(j) of the Act.</textblock>
