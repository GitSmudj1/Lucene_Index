    <textblock>Status of Environmental Analysis:</textblock>
    <textblock>This application is now ready for environmental analysis at this time_see attached paragraph D9.</textblock>
    <textblock>l.</textblock>
    <textblock>The existing project consists of:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) A 18.5-foot-high, 217-foot-long concrete and wooden dam 150 feet upstream from the Snoqualmie Falls, with 4.5-foot-high flashboards and lift gates, creating an impoundment with a storage capacity of 390-acre-feet; (2) an intake structure on the south bank of the river about 150 feet upstream from the dam feeding; (3) two 7.5-foot-diameter steel penstocks, in 270-foot-long vertical rock shafts leading to; (4) Plant 1 which is an underground powerhouse containing 5 generating units with a total capacity of 11,900 kW; (5) a 317-foot-long, 115-kV transmission line; (6) an intake structure on the north bank about 50 feet upstream from the dam feeding; (7) a 12-foot-diameter, 1,215-foot-long concrete lined tunnel leading to; (8) a small forebay and then to an 8-foot-diameter, 600-foot-long steel penstock for unit 1 and two 7-foot-diameter, 75-foot-long steel penstock which will combine into a 10-foot-diameter, 515-foot-long steel penstock for unit 2 leading to; (9) Plant 2 which is an above ground powerhouse with 2 generating units with a total capacity of 30,090 kW; (10) a 0.5-mile-long, 115-kV transmission line; and (11) other appurtenances. The project has an average annual generation of 256,000 MWH.</textblock>
    <textblock>The applicant proposes to: (1) Refurbish the dam and add spillway capacity; (2) refurbish the intake structure for Plant 1; (3) replace the existing penstocks to Plant 1 for an 8-foot-diameter steel penstock; (4) replace the 5 existing units in Plant 1 with a new 9-MW unit; (5) abandon the existing and construct a new intake for Plant 2; (6) replace the existing tunnel and penstocks to Plant 2 with a 20-foot-diameter, 250-foot-long vertical shaft and a 1,575-foot-long, 18-foot-high by 18-foot-wide horseshoe concrete-lined tunnel; and (7) upgrade the 2 existing units in Plant 2 and extend the powerhouse to install a new unit for a total capacity of 64,000 kW.</textblock>
    <textblock>After upgrades and equipment additions, the project would have a total installed capacity of 73 MW with an average annual generation of 381,000 MWH.</textblock>
    <textblock>m.</textblock>
    <textblock>Purpose of this Project:</textblock>
    <textblock>The energy generated by the project is used by the applicant in its system. The applicant is an investor-owned utility company.</textblock>
