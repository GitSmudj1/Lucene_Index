    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 10 and 17, 1993, the Committee for Purchase From</textblock>
    <textblock>People Who Are Blind or Severely Disabled published notices (58</textblock>
    <textblock>FR 64932 and 65971) of proposed additions to the Procurement</textblock>
    <textblock>List.</textblock>
    <textblock>After consideration of the material presented to it concerning</textblock>
    <textblock>capability of qualified nonprofit agencies to provide the</textblock>
    <textblock>services, fair market price, and impact of the additions on the</textblock>
    <textblock>current or most recent contractors, the Committee has determined</textblock>
    <textblock>that the services listed below are suitable for procurement by the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Government under 41 U.S.C. 46-48c and 41 CFR 51-2.4.</textblock>
    <textblock>I certify that the following action will not have a significant</textblock>
    <textblock>impact on a substantial number of small entities. The major</textblock>
    <textblock>factors considered for this certification were:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The action will not result in any additional reporting,</textblock>
    <textblock>recordkeeping or other compliance requirements for small entities</textblock>
    <textblock>other than the small organizations that will furnish the services</textblock>
    <textblock>to the Government.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. The action does not appear to have a severe economic impact on</textblock>
    <textblock>current contractors for the services.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The action will result in authorizing small entities to furnish</textblock>
    <textblock>the services to the Government.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. There are no known regulatory alternatives which would</textblock>
    <textblock>accomplish the objectives of the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Act (41</textblock>
    <textblock>U.S.C. 46-48c) in connection with the services proposed for</textblock>
    <textblock>addition to the Procurement List.</textblock>
