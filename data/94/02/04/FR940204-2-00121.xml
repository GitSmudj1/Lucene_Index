    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (title 44, U.S.C., chapter 35), this notice announces a request to revise the use of OPM Form 805 that collects information from the public. OPM Form 805, Application to be Listed Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, is used to elicit information from persons applying for voter registration under the authority of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The requirements for voter eligibility vary from State to State; therefore, OPM Form 805 is a blanket number covering 10 forms which conform to the individual State's requirements. The form requires 20 minutes to complete. Approximately 10 individuals complete the form annually for a total public burden of 4 hours.</textblock>
