    <textblock>2. Statutory Basis</textblock>
    <textblock>The NASD believes the proposed rule change is consistent with section 15A(b)(6) of the Act. Section 15A(b)(6) requires that the rules of a national securities association be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. Specifically, the NASD believes the use of fifth-character, geographic indicators is consistent with the maintenance of fair and orderly markets and the facilitation of transactions in securities because it will eliminate unnecessary confusion and delay in trading of securities and foster cooperation between members and market makers effecting trades in securities quoted on the OTCBB.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition</textblock>
    <textblock>The NASD believes that the proposed rule change will not result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.</textblock>
