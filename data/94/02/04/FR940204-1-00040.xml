    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This notice proposes special conditions for the Soloy Dual Pac engine. This engine will have a novel design feature associated with its configuration. The Dual Pac engine is a propulsion system in which two Pratt &amp; Whitney (P&amp;W) PT6 gas turbine engines are combined through a common gearbox to drive a single output propeller shaft. The Dual Pac engine is intended to provide a degree of continuous operation following the failure of one of the P&amp;W PT6 engines. The applicable regulations do not contain adequate or appropriate safety standards for such a configuration. This notice proposes the additional safety standards which the Administrator considers necessary to establish a level of safety equivalent to that established by the airworthiness standards of part 33 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR).</textblock>

    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>General</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 9, 1990, Soloy Dual Pac, Inc., applied for a supplemental type certificate for the Dual Pac engine. The Dual Pac engine is a propulsion concept in which two Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6 engines, currently approved under Type Certificate No. E4EA, drive a single propeller shaft through a combining gearbox. The Dual Pac engine incorporates redundant freewheeling, drive, governing, and lubricating systems. A system of one-way clutches both prevents the propeller shaft from driving the engine input shafts and allows either engine to drive the propeller should the other engine fail. The supplemental type certificate for the Dual Pac engine is to be based on the type certificate of the Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6 engine.</textblock>
    <textblock>Safety Analysis</textblock>
    <textblock>The certification basis of the P&amp;W PT6 engine was established before the introduction of FAR ยง33.75 (Safety Analysis). Section 33.75 addresses four types of engine failure conditions which are particularly hazardous to the safety of the aircraft. The objective of ยง33.75 is to require an analysis to be performed at the engine level which establishes that any probable single or multiple failure, or any probable improper operation will not cause the engine to catch fire, burst, generate loads greater than the ultimate loads for the engine mount, or lose the capability to shut down. Consequently, it is considered appropriate to add a safety analysis requirement to the Dual Pac engine program.</textblock>
    <textblock>Also, one objective of the Dual Pac engine is to provide continued operation after the failure of one P&amp;W PT6 engine. While the safety analysis regulations of ยง33.75 are more extensive than those of the P&amp;W PT6 engine certification basis, they still do not address this special ``continue to run'' objective.</textblock>
