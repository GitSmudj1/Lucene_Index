    <textblock>IV. Subpart C_Quarterly Reports to Investors</textblock>
    <textblock>Proposed §630.40, ``Content of the quarterly report to investors,'' contains provisions similar to those contained in subpart C of part 620 of this chapter. Supplemental financial statement information required to be disclosed in the annual report must also be presented in quarterly reports.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed regulations would require a quarterly report to be presented in an easily understandable format and in a manner that is not misleading. Quarterly reports may be prepared on the presumption that readers of the report have read or have access to the most recently published annual report. The adequacy of additional disclosure needed in the quarterly report may be determined in that context.</textblock>
    <textblock>The rules for condensation applicable to individual institutions for preparing their quarterly financial statements prescribed in part 620 of this chapter have been incorporated in proposed part 630 to apply to the preparation of the Systemwide quarterly financial statements. In addition, proposed §630.40(b)(4) would require that quarterly reports to investors update material contingencies that exist at the time of the interim reporting even though a significant change since yearend may not have occurred.</textblock>
    <textblock>Proposed §630.40(d) sets forth the requirements of the interim financial statements of the quarterly report and the respective comparative periods of the interim statements presented. Proposed §630.40(e) specifies the reporting periods for which quarterly supplemental information would be required. The proposed regulations do not require that interim financial statements or supplemental information be audited. However, the FCA may require the Systemwide combined financial statements of an interim period to be audited should the need arise for supervisory actions.</textblock>
