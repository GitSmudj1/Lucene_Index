    <textblock>The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee at the SEC's Public Reference Branch.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicant's Representations</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Applicant is an open-end management investment company organized as a Maryland corporation. SEC records indicate that applicant filed a notification of registration under section 8(a) of the Act of September 12, 1988. On October 14, 1988, applicant filed a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 and section 8(b) of the Act. The registration statement was declared effective on January 9, 1989, and applicant's initial public offering commenced on January 24, 1989.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. At a meeting held on February 5, 1993, applicant's board of directors resolved to liquidate applicant. An information statement outlining the plan of liquidation was filed with the SEC prior to the meeting, and was distributed to shareholders immediately following the meeting. The information statement represented that continued operation of applicant at its size was not economically feasible for applicant's shareholders or Palm Beach Capital Management, Ltd., applicant's investment adviser.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The plan of liquidation was approved by applicant's shareholders at a special meeting of shareholders on February 26, 1993. As of that date, there were 290,955.34 shares of applicant's common stock outstanding, and a net asset value per share of $1.00.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Applicant was liquidated on March 1, 1993, the next business day immediately following the meeting of applicant's shareholders. The final distribution to shareholders was based on the net asset per share on the date of liquidation. All expenses associated with the liquidation were assumed by applicant's adviser.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. At the time of the application, applicant had no shareholders, assets, or liabilities. Applicant is not a party to any litigation or administrative proceeding. Applicant is not presently engaged in, nor will it partake in, activities other than those associated with the winding up of its affairs.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. Applicant will file a certificate of dissolution with the State of Maryland, as the intent is to dissolve the corporation.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the SEC, by the Division of Investment Management, under delegated authority.</textblock>
