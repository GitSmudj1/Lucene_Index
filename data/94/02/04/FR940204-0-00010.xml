    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>In a notice published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of March 10, 1992 (57 FR 8460), FDA announced that a food additive petition (FAP 2A4310) had been filed by Miles, Inc., Mobay Rd., Pittsburgh, PA 15205-9741, proposing that the food additive regulations in §172.133</textblock>
    <textblock>Dimethyl dicarbonate</textblock>
    <textblock>(21 CFR 172.133) be amended to provide for the safe use of dimethyl dicarbonate as a yeast inhibitor in ready-to-drink tea beverages.</textblock>
    <textblock>As discussed in more detail below, FDA has evaluated data in the petition and other relevant material and concludes that the proposed use of dimethyl dicarbonate (DMDC) in ready-to-drink tea beverages is safe.</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Determination of Safety</textblock>
    <textblock>Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called ``general safety clause,'' a food additive cannot be approved for a particular use unless a fair evaluation of the evidence establishes that the additive is safe for that use. FDA's food additive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)) define safe as ``a reasonable certainty in the minds of competent scientists that the substance is not harmful under the intended conditions of use.''</textblock>
    <textblock>The anticancer or Delaney clause of the Food Additives Amendment (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act) further provides that no food additive shall be deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by man or animal. Importantly, however, the Delaney clause applies to the additive itself, not to constituents of the additive. That is, where an additive itself has not been shown to cause cancer, but contains a carcinogenic impurity, such additive is properly evaluated under the general safety clause using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use of the additive (</textblock>
    <textblock>Scott</textblock>
    <textblock>v.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA</textblock>
    <textblock>, 728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984)).</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Safety of Dimethyl Dicarbonate in Ready-to-Drink Tea Beverages</textblock>
    <textblock>Dimethyl dicarbonate is currently permitted as a yeast inhibitor in wine and wine substitutes (dealcoholized wine and low alcohol wine) under §172.133. In the final rules establishing this regulation (53 FR 41325, October 21, 1988; and 58 FR 6088, January 26, 1993) the agency concluded that, because dimethyl dicarbonate decomposes almost immediately after addition to beverages, there will be virtually no exposure of the consumer to the additive from its use in wine and wine substitutes.</textblock>
    <textblock>Data submitted in the petition concerning the use of the additive in tea beverages are consistent with these findings in wine and wine substitutes. Specifically, data from a study on the hydrolysis of dimethyl dicarbonate in tea showed no detectable amount of the additive after 4 hours (limit of analytical detectability = 40 parts per billion (ppb)) (Ref. 1). Based on these data, the agency concludes that there will be virtually no consumer exposure to dimethyl dicarbonate from the use of the additive in ready-to-drink tea beverages. Therefore, FDA concludes that dimethyl dicarbonate itself presents no hazard to the consumer.</textblock>
    <textblock>IV. Safety of Substances That May Be Present in Tea Beverages Due to the Use of the Additive</textblock>
    <textblock>Dimethyl dicarbonate is unstable in aqueous solution and breaks down almost immediately after addition to beverages. In aqueous liquids, the principal breakdown products are methanol and carbon dioxide. Methyl ethyl carbonate, as well as carbomethoxy amino- and hydroxy-adducts of amines, sugars, and fruit acids may also be formed in minor amounts. Dimethyl carbonate is present as an impurity in dimethyl dicarbonate. Dimethyl dicarbonate also may react with traces of ammonia or ammonium ions to form trace quantities of methyl carbamate, a compound that has been shown to cause cancer in laboratory animals (Ref. 2).</textblock>
    <textblock>In approving the use of dimethyl dicarbonate in wine and wine substitutes, the agency, in accordance with 21 CFR 171.1, reviewed the safety not only of dimethyl dicarbonate but also of its decomposition products in aqueous beverages. The same analysis from that review was applied by the agency in reviewing the petitioned use of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea beverages. The results of the agency's analysis of the additive's use in wine and wine substitutes were discussed extensively in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of October 21, 1988, and January 26, 1993, final rules, which are referenced; that analysis applies equally to the evaluation of the petitioned use of DMDC. Aspects of the safety evaluation of the decompostion products that may result from the use of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea beverages that were not discussed previously are discussed below.</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Minor Reaction Products</textblock>
    <textblock>In its previous evaluation of the safety of minor breakdown products of dimethyl dicarbonate in aqueous solutions, the agency concluded that there is no evidence of added risk from exposure to those minor products. For this petition, the agency also evaluated results from an acute toxicity study on a series of putative adducts (</textblock>
    <textblock>N</textblock>
    <textblock>-carbomethoxy conjugates of trigallic acid, glycine, glutamic acid, alanine, proline, asparagine, cysteine, phenylalanine, arginine, leucine, and monocysteine) that may be formed by dimethyl dicarbonate when added to ready-to-drink tea beverages. Results of the study showed that LD</textblock>
    <textblock>50</textblock>
    <textblock>for each of the adducts in mice or rats ranged between 4,600 and &gt;15,000 milligrams per kilogram body weight (mg/kg body weight), thereby indicating the low order of acute toxicity of those substances (Ref. 3).</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Methanol</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA previously estimated that the total human exposure to methanol from consumption of food that naturally contains methanol and of wine or wine substitutes that are treated with dimethyl dicarbonate to be 50 to 60 mg per person per day (mg/person/day) (58 FR 6088). The tolerable (safe) level for methanol is 7.1 to 8.4 mg/kg body weight (426 to 504 mg/person/day for a 60-kg adult) based on reports of studies in human subjects (Ref. 4). The agency estimates that the methanol exposure from the petitioned use of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea would be 40 mg/person/day at tea intake of 332 grams(g)/person/day (90th percentile) (Ref. 1). This would increase the human exposure to methanol to 90 to 100 mg/person/day (to approximately one-fifth of the tolerable safe level). The agency, therefore, concludes that there is an adequate margin of safety between the methanol consumption from the use of dimethyl dicarbonate and the amount of methanol that can be safely ingested (Ref. 4).</textblock>
    <textblock>C. Methyl Carbamate</textblock>
    <textblock>Methyl carbamate, a carcinogen, was detected in wines treated with dimethyl dicarbonate; based on a quantitative risk assessment, the agency concluded that there was a reasonable certainty of no harm from exposure to methyl carbamate in wines and wine substitutes (58 FR 6088 at 6090).</textblock>
    <textblock>Methyl carbamate was not detected in dimethyl dicarbonate-treated ready-to-drink tea, using an analytical method with a limit of detection of 5 ppb. Assuming that methyl carbamate could be present at 2.5 ppb (one-half the limit of detection) and using an estimated value for intake of tea beverages (332 g/person/day (90th percentile)), FDA estimates that the exposure to methyl carbamate from the petitioned use of dimethyl dicarbonate would be no more than 0.8 microgram/person/day (Ref. 1) for individuals consuming ready-to-drink tea at the 90th percentile level. Using the same principles and quantitative risk assessment procedure that were applied to the wine and wine substitutes, as discussed in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of October 21, 1988, and January 26, 1993, final rules, and the exposure to methyl carbamate estimated above, FDA estimates that the upper-bound limit of individual lifetime risk from potential exposure to methyl carbamate from the use of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea is 7.8 x 10</textblock>
    <textblock>-9</textblock>
    <textblock>, or less than 1 in 128 million (Refs. 3, 5, and 6).</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, the agency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from the exposure to methyl carbamate that may result from the use of up to 250 ppm of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea beverages.</textblock>
    <textblock>D. Conclusion On Safety</textblock>
    <textblock>FDA has evaluated all of the data in the petition pertaining to the use of dimethyl dicarbonate in ready-to-drink tea beverages and concludes that the additive is safe for its proposed use.</textblock>
    <textblock>To ensure the safe use of the additive in ready-to-drink tea beverages, FDA, under 21 U.S.C. 348(c)(1)(A), is amending §172.133(c)(2) to require directions on the food additive label limiting the level of use of the additive in tea beverages to 250 ppm.</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with §171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition and the documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decision to approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contact person listed above. As provided in 21 CFR 171.1(h), the agency will delete from the documents any materials that are not available for public disclosure before making the documents available for inspection.</textblock>
    <textblock>V. Environmental Impact</textblock>
    <textblock>The agency has carefully considered the potential environmental effects of this action. FDA has concluded that the action will not have a significant impact on the human environment, and that an environmental impact statement is not required. The agency's finding of no significant impact and the evidence supporting that finding, contained in an environmental assessment, may be seen in the Dockets Management Branch (address above) between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.</textblock>
    <textblock>VI. Objections</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person who will be adversely affected by this regulation may at any time on or before March 7, 1994, file with the Dockets Management Branch (address above) written objections thereto. Each objection shall be separately numbered, and each numbered objection shall specify with particularity the provisions of the regulation to which objection is made and the grounds for the objection. Each numbered objection on which a hearing is requested shall specifically so state.
