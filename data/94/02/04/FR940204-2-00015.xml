    <textblock>When any inspection or related service such as, but not limited to, initial and final establishment surveys, appeal inspections, contract lot inspections, sanitation evaluations, Sanitary Inspected Fish Establishment (SIFE) inspections, sampling, product evaluations, and label and product specification reviews, requires charges to which the foregoing sections are clearly inapplicable, charges will be based on the rates set forth below:</textblock>
    <textblock>In keeping with the intent of the authorizing legislation and the policies of the Inspection Program to charge fees to recover, as nearly as possible, the costs of providing inspection services, the hourly rates charged to contract lot inspection users who provide complete and acceptable facilities that are used by U.S. Department of Commerce (USDC) inspectors to conduct the necessary official contract functions will be those delineated under Type I. In all other cases, contract lot inspection users will be charged Type III rates.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition to the hourly fee charges for inspection services, all users of voluntary seafood inspection services should note that charges will be assessed for sampling and laboratory analysis that will be performed randomly on a limited frequency, depending on the health risk of the end product to consumers. This sampling and analysis protocol, conducted as a surveillance mechanism of the NSIP and the industry, will provide added verification that the consumer receives safe products. The details of the surveillance sampling and billing procedures are available upon request.</textblock>
    <textblock>For current participants and interested parties in the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point (HACCP) -based service, modifications in determining the charges for HACCP plan review have been completed and are available, as well as more specific program requirements for vessel, retail, and food service establishments.</textblock>
