    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On October 13, 1993, the Secretary of Commerce received a request that the Secretary monitor imports of certain chrome-plated lug nuts (``CPLNs''), from the Republic of Korea under section 732(a)(2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (``the Act''), and ยง353.11(c) of the Department's regulations. The request was submitted by Consolidated International Automotive, Inc. (``Consolidated''), the largest domestic producer of CPLNs, and applies to one-piece and two-piece chrome-plated lug nuts, finished or unfinished, which are more than 11/16 inches (17.45 millimeters) in height and which have a hexagonal (``hex'') size of at least three quarters of an inch (19.05 millimeters) but not greater than one inch (25.4 millimeters). The term ``unfinished'' refers to unplated and/or unassembled chrome-plated lug nuts. CPLNs are included under item number 7318.16.0010 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. Consolidated requests that the Secretary monitor imports of these products from the Republic of Korea, alleging that the circumstances which allow the Department to monitor imports currently exist. Under section 732(a)(2) of the Act, the requirements for the Secretary to monitor imports are: (a) More than one antidumping duty order for the same class or kind of merchandise must be in effect; (b) the Department must have a reason to believe or suspect that there exists an extraordinary pattern of persistent injurious dumping with respect to shipments from one or more additional supplier countries; and (c) this extraordinary pattern of persistent injurious dumping is causing a serious commercial problem for the domestic industry.</textblock>
