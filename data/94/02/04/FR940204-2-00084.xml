    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice is hereby given that, in a letter dated January 25, 1994, the President amended the cost-sharing arrangements concerning Federal funds provided under the authority of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq</textblock>
    <textblock>.), in a letter to James L. Witt, Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>I have determined that the damage in certain areas of the State of California, resulting from an earthquake and aftershocks on January 17, 1994, and continuing, is of sufficient severity and magnitude that special cost-sharing conditions are warranted under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (``the Stafford Act'') for the Public Assistance program.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, I amend my previous declaration to authorize Federal funds for Public Assistance at 90 percent of total eligible costs, except for direct Federal assistance costs for emergency work, which are authorized at 100 percent Federal funding until January 25, 1994. This 90 percent reimbursement applies to all authorized Public Assistance costs.</textblock>
    <textblock>This adjustment to State and local cost sharing applies only to Public Assistance costs eligible for such adjustment under the law. The law specifically prohibits a similar adjustment for funds provided to States for the Individual and Family Grant program. These funds will continue to be reimbursed at 75 percent of total eligible costs.</textblock>
    <textblock>Please notify the Governor of the State of California and the Federal Coordinating Officer of this amendment to my major disaster declaration.</textblock>
