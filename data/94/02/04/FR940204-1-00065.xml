    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Service proposes to determine the callippe silverspot</textblock>
    <textblock>butterfly (</textblock>
    <textblock>Speyeria callippe callippe</textblock>
    <textblock>), Behren's silverspot butterfly</textblock>
    <textblock>(</textblock>
    <textblock>Speyeria zerene behrensii</textblock>
    <textblock>), and the Alameda whipsnake (</textblock>
    <textblock>Masticophis</textblock>
    <textblock>lateralis euryxanthus</textblock>
    <textblock>) as endangered pursuant to the Endangered Species</textblock>
    <textblock>Act of 1973, as amended (Act). The three species are found in northern</textblock>
    <textblock>and central California.</textblock>
    <textblock>These animals and the foodplants of the larval butterflies occur on</textblock>
    <textblock>private, county, and State land, and are imperiled by one or more of the</textblock>
    <textblock>following: overcollecting, commercial and residential development,</textblock>
    <textblock>competition from alien plants, inappropriate levels of livestock</textblock>
    <textblock>grazing, off-road vehicle use, trampling by hikers and livestock, and</textblock>
    <textblock>perhaps stochastic (i.e., random) extinction by virtue of the small,</textblock>
    <textblock>isolated nature of the remaining populations. This proposal, if made</textblock>
    <textblock>final, would implement protection provided by the Act for these animals.</textblock>
    <textblock>Critical habitat is not being proposed.</textblock>
