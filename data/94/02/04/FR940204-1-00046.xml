  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document proposes the adoption of a new airworthiness directive (AD) that is applicable to certain Jetstream Model 4101 airplanes. This proposal would require modification of the aileron drive quadrant support structure. This proposal is prompted by results of a stress analysis check, which revealed that the factor of safety of the aileron drive quadrant support structure on Model 4101 airplanes does not meet the tail-to-wind gust load design case strength requirements specified in the Federal Aviation Regulations. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent cracking of the support structure, which could result in reduced controllability of the airplane.</textblock>
