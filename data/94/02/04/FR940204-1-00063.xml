    <textblock>Several changes made to Rule 4-37 for the purposes of incorporating Stage II requirements directly affect the other petroleum transfer and storage requirements covered by Rule 4-37. Section 120-04-3701(D) of Rule 4-37 places, for the first time, the burden of proof for eligibility for exemption from any portion of the rule on the owner. Facilities seeking compliance exemptions (based upon throughput thresholds) for any petroleum storage and transfer operation covered by Rule 4-37 are now required to retain records to prove their exempt status.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 120-04-3703(D)(3) of Rule 4-37 has been revised to change the applicability requirement for vapor recovery controls at gasoline loading bulk plants. The applicability exemption for facilities with average daily throughput of less than 4,000 gallons is now based upon a thirty day rolling average, instead of total average throughput. Average daily throughput must now be calculated for the two most recent years, for which time if this value exceeds 4,000 gallons per day, the facility is subject to the vapor recovery requirements for bulk plants.</textblock>
    <textblock>V. Regulatory Changes Affecting VOC Control Areas</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commonwealth has revised Appendix P of Rule 4-37 to separately list nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions control areas, in addition to listing VOC emissions control areas. The list of VOC emissions control areas submitted in this November 5, 1992 revision is unchanged from that of the May 10, 1991 SIP revision submitted to satisfy the requirements of section 182(a)(2)(A) of the Act_otherwise known as ``RACT fix-ups''. Additionally, a list of NOx emission control areas identical to the VOC emission control areas list has been added.</textblock>
    <textblock>Proposed Action</textblock>
    <textblock>Because EPA believes that the State has adopted a Stage II regulation in accordance with section 182(b)(3) of the Act, as interpreted in EPA's guidance, EPA is proposing to approve Title 120-01 of the Commonwealth of Virginia's Regulations for the Control and Abatement of Air Pollution, part IV, Rule 4-37 (Petroleum Liquid Storage and Transfer Operations), §§120-04-3701 to 120-04-3715 and Appendices P and S, as a revision to the Virginia State Implementation Plan (SIP) for ozone as meeting the requirements of sections 182(b)(3).</textblock>
    <textblock>Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting or allowing or establishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP. Each request for revision to a SIP shall be considered in light of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and in relation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 600</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq</textblock>
    <textblock>., EPA must prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis assessing the impact of any proposed or final rule on small entities. 5 U.S.C. 603 and 604. Alternatively, EPA may certify that the rule will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. Small entities include small businesses, small not-for-profit enterprises, and government entities with jurisdiction over populations of less than 50,000.</textblock>
    <textblock>SIP approvals under section 110 and subchapter I, part D of the Act do not create any new requirements, but simply approve requirements that the State is already imposing. Therefore, because the federal SIP approval does not impose any new requirements, I certify that it does not have a significant impact on any small entities affected. Moreover, due to the nature of the federal-state relationship under the Act, preparation of a regulatory flexibility analysis would constitute federal inquiry into the economic reasonableness of State action. The Act forbids EPA to base its actions concerning SIP's on such grounds.</textblock>

    <textblock>This proposed approval action for Stage II gasoline vapor recovery for Virginia has been classified as a Table 2 action by the Regional Administrator under the procedures published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January 6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) waived Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions from the requirements of section 3 of Executive Order 12291 for a period of 2 years (54 FR 2222). The EPA has submitted a request for a permanent waiver for Table 2 and Table 3 SIP revisions. The OMB has agreed to continue the waiver until such time as it rules on EPA's request. This request is still applicable under Executive Order 12866 which superseded Executive Order 12291 on September 30, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove Virginia's Stage II gasoline vapor recovery SIP revision will be based on whether it meets the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(A)-(K), 110(a)(3), and part D of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in 40 CFR part 51.</textblock>
