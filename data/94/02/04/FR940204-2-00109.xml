    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Director, U.S. Employment Service, announces 1994 adverse effect wage rates (AEWRs) for employers seeking nonimmigrant alien (H-2A) workers for temporary or seasonal agricultural labor or services and the allowable charges employers seeking nonimmigrant alien workers for temporary or seasonal agricultural labor or services or logging work may levy upon their workers when they provide three meals per day.</textblock>
    <textblock>AEWRs are the minimum wage rates which the Department of Labor has determined must be offered and paid to U.S. and alien workers by employers of nonimmigrant alien agricultural workers (H-2A visaholders). AEWRs are established to prevent the employment of these aliens from adversely affecting wages of similarly employed U.S. workers.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Director also announces the new rates which covered agricultural and logging employers may charge their workers for three daily meals.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Attorney General may not approve an employer's petition for admission of temporary alien agricultural (H-2A) workers to perform agricultural labor or services of a temporary or seasonal nature in the United States unless the petitioner has applied to the Department of Labor (DOL) for an H-2A labor certification. The labor certification must show that: (1) There are not sufficient U.S. workers who are able, willing, and qualified and who will be available at the time and place needed to perform the labor or services involved in the petition; and (2) the employment of the alien in such labor or services will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of workers in the United States similarly employed. 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(a), 1184(c), and 1188.</textblock>
    <textblock>DOL's regulations for the H-2A program require that covered employers offer and pay their U.S. and H-2A workers no less than the applicable hourly adverse effect wage rate (AEWR). 20 CFR 655.102(b)(9); see also 20 CFR 655.107. Reference should be made to the preamble to the July 5, 1989, final rule (54 FR 28037), which explains in great depth the purpose and history of AEWRs, DOL's discretion in setting AEWRs, and the AEWR computation methodology at 20 CFR 655.107(a). See also 52 FR 20496, 20502-20505 (June 1, 1987).</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Adverse Effect Wage Rates (AEWRs) for 1994</textblock>
    <textblock>Adverse effect wage rates (AEWRs) are the minimum wage rates which DOL has determined must be offered and paid to U.S. and alien workers by employers of nonimmigrant (H-2A) agricultural workers. DOL emphasizes, however, that such employers must pay the highest of the AEWR, the applicable prevailing wage or the statutory minimum wage, as specified in the regulations. 20 CFR 655.102(b)(9). Except as otherwise provided in 20 CFR Part 655, Subpart B, the regionwide AEWR for all agricultural employment (except those occupations deemed inappropriate under the special circumstances provisions of 20 CFR 655.93) for which temporary alien agricultural labor (H-2A) certification is being sought, is equal to the annual weighted average hourly wage rate for field and livestock workers (combined) for the region as published annually by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA does not provide data on Alaska). 20 CFR 655.107(a).</textblock>
