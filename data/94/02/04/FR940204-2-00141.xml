    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>In response to the recommendations of both the National Performance Review and the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry, an executive oversight committee, sponsored by the Secretary of Transportation, is developing a detailed plan to restructure FAA's air traffic control services as a Government corporation. The committee is developing a corporate structure that would streamline procurement, simplify the personnel process, provide funding stability, and ensure continuity of leadership among the objectives. The committee is comprised of senior officials from the Department of Transportation, Department of Defense, Office of Management and Budget, Council of Economic Advisers, National Economic Council, National Performance Review, and various other agencies. Alternative proposals are an FAA corporation and an air traffic control corporation. The oversight committee is soliciting suggestions and concerns regarding these proposals or any suggested alternatives.</textblock>
    <textblock>Specific Issues for Public Comment</textblock>
    <textblock>There are specific issues discussed in the following paragraphs on which the DOT's executive oversight committee seeks comment at the public meeting. Identification of these key issues is intended to help focus public comment on those areas which will be most useful in developing legislative proposals. However, comments at the meeting need not be limited to these issues.</textblock>
    <textblock>Safety Issues, including: How a restructured air traffic control system would be organized, operated and maintained to best guarantee safety for the traveling public; the relationship between the proposed corporation and FAA with respect to safety; and any other specific safety issues that must be managed in the formulation of a corporate structure.</textblock>
    <textblock>Budget and Financial Issues, including: The source of revenues for the ATC corporation; the pricing structure; the Government's role, if any, in ensuring sufficient revenues to cover the costs of the system; questions of financing from the Aviation Trust Fund; liability for ATC-related-accidents; and DOD funding issues.</textblock>
    <textblock>Procurement Issues, including: The procurement authorities the corporation should have and whether elements of the Government's current procurement process (e.g., full and open competition, Brooks Act, etc.) should be retained.</textblock>
    <textblock>Personnel Issues, including: The functions and placement of FAA employees, and which existing personnel rules and principles, if any, should apply to the corporation.</textblock>
    <textblock>Oversight and Governance Issues, including: How an ATC corporation should be governed; how it should be accountable to the public and to Congress; who should oversee the ATC system; and what rulemaking and enforcement authorities should rest with the corporation and what should remain with the FAA.</textblock>
