    <textblock>NMFS announces changes in its fees and charges, effective January 1, 1994. However, since the regulations are being amended to allow for review and revision of inspection fees and charges as needed, rather than annually as currently written, the identified fees and charges will apply until further notice. NMFS is anticipating no further changes in fees and charges until October 1994. The change in fees and charges represents an increase of 6.0 percent in the basic hourly rates and results from higher operating costs such as salaries, transportation, and supplies.</textblock>
