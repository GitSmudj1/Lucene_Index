    <textblock>Bureau regulations in 28 CFR 551.150 include references to the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 and to the Attorney General's guidelines for victim and witness assistance. These references are more appropriately placed in the authority citation for the part and are accordingly removed from the text of the regulation. The newly revised authority citation for 28 CFR part 551, which already included reference to the pertinent provisions of the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (18 U.S.C. 1512), now includes reference to the most recent revision of the Attorney General's guidelines for victim and witness assistance.</textblock>
    <textblock>Because these amendments are administrative in nature and impose no new restrictions on inmates, the Bureau finds good cause for exempting the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) requiring notice of proposed rulemaking, the opportunity for public comment, and delay in effective date. Members of the public may submit comments concerning this rule by writing to the previously cited address. These comments will be considered but will receive no response in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Bureau of Prisons has determined that this rule is not a significant regulatory action for the purpose of E.O. 12866, and accordingly was not reviewed by the Office of Management and Budget. After review of the law and regulations, the Director, Bureau of Prisons has certified that this rule, for the purpose of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), does not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities.</textblock>
