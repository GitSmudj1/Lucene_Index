    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule sets forth the jurisdiction of the Independent Counsel: In re Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan Association, appointed by the Attorney General pursuant to her statutory authority under 28 U.S.C. 509, 510, and 543, and 5 U.S.C. 301. The Attorney General has appointed this Independent Counsel to investigate whether any individuals or entities have committed a violation of any federal criminal or civil law relating to President William Jefferson Clinton's or Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton's relationships with the Madison Guaranty Savings &amp; Loan Association, the Whitewater Development Corporation, or Capital Management Services, Inc.</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule also amends the regulations on the salary of an Independent Counsel and the provisions for appointing, fixing the compensation of, and assigning duties to such employees as the Independent Counsel deems necessary. These changes reflect the elimination of the ``GS-18'' rate under the General Schedule, 5 U.S.C. 5332(a), more closely align the regulation with the laws governing the civil service, and provide more flexibility in setting the salary of the Independent Counsel, subject to a specified maximum level.</textblock>
