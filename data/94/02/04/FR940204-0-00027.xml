    <textblock>Section 335-3-4-.09(3), Charging_</textblock>
    <textblock>This section limits charging emissions to less than 20 percent except for 3 minutes in any hour for batteries with less than 70 ovens.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 335-3-4-.09(4), Pushing_</textblock>
    <textblock>This section forbids any visible emissions greater that 40 percent during the pushing cycle except for one push per hour (EPA approved this regulation April 4, 1979 (44 FR 20079)).</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 335-3-4-.09(5)</textblock>
    <textblock>_This section limits visible emissions to 10 percent at the offtake piping and no more than 5 percent at the charging lids.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 335-3-4-.09(6), Coke Oven Doors_</textblock>
    <textblock>This section provides that there shall be no visible emissions from more than 15 percent of the doors of the battery.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 335-3-4-.09(7)_</textblock>
    <textblock>This section describes the general maintenance requirements for coke ovens.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 335-3-4-.09(8), Combustion Stacks_</textblock>
    <textblock>This section provides that there shall be no visible emissions of an opacity greater than 20 percent from any stack except for 3 minutes in any consecutive 60 minutes.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 335-3-4-.09(9), Quenching_</textblock>
    <textblock>This section requires that quench towers be provided with properly operating baffles and provides for water quality guidelines.</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA's analysis of emission reductions needed to achieve attainment of the particulate matter NAAQS resulted in a finding that the proposed pushing regulation (335-3-4-.09(4)) was inadequate. EPA, therefore, took no official action on that regulation on August 28, 1975, when the other regulations were approved, pending the conclusion of additional studies. Consequently, the State's process weight and general opacity regulations remained the only federally approved regulation for coke oven pushing emissions. On April 4, 1979, EPA approved coke oven plan revisions submitted on July 14, 1978, to attain the national standards for particulate matter. These regulations were later relaxed to the 1975 version.</textblock>
    <textblock>Neither of the two regulatory approaches heretofore described contained specific regulations to limit fugitive particulate emissions from road dust, parking lots, storage piles, etc. However, these nontraditional fugitive emissions are now subject to limitations by permit condition and by the terms of today's final rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>On March 3, 1978, in accordance with section 107(d) of the CAA, EPA designated the area surrounding the Gulf States Steel Corporation facility in Etowah County, Alabama, as nonattainment for total suspended particulates (TSP). Gulf States Steel Corporation remained the dominant major point source contributing to the particulate nonattainment problem in Etowah County.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 172 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) requires that plan revisions assuring the attainment of the NAAQS for particulate matter are to provide for the implementation of reasonably available control technology (RACT) as expeditiously as practicable. In response to the section 107(d) nonattainment designation and call for a particulate SIP revision for Etowah and Jefferson Counties, Alabama revised its coke oven pushing and charging regulations to require a RACT level of control. These regulations were directed specifically to Jefferson and Etowah Counties and were federally approved on April 4, 1979. These regulations, however, were never implemented due to legal challenges to the section 107 redesignation process. On procedural grounds, Republic Steel and U.S. Steel challenged the validity of EPA's March 3, 1978, designation of portions of Jefferson and Etowah Counties as nonattainment areas for TSP.</textblock>
    <textblock>On May 3, 1979, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals (now the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals) in</textblock>
    <textblock>Republic Steel vs. EPA</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>U.S. Steel vs. EPA</textblock>
    <textblock>found that EPA had not adequately complied with the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act in its nonattainment designation action, and directed EPA to initiate the designation process again. On June 10, 1980, EPA again designated Etowah County as primary nonattainment for TSP and directed the State to submit a SIP revision. U.S. Steel and Republic Steel did not appeal this designation of nonattainment by EPA.</textblock>
