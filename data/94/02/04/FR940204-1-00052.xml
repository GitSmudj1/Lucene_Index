    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document withdraws proposed changes of position</textblock>
    <textblock>with respect to the definition of the term ``passenger'' for</textblock>
    <textblock>purpose of the coastwise passenger statute.</textblock>
    <textblock>Customs has concluded that it is not appropriate to change its</textblock>
    <textblock>position at this time inasmuch as it will consider changing the</textblock>
    <textblock>definition of passenger contained in 19 CFR 4.50(b) as part of a</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed revision to 19 CFR part 4 which will occur as a result</textblock>
    <textblock>of the recent enactment of title VI of the North American Free</textblock>
    <textblock>Trade Agreement Implementation Act the</textblock>
    <textblock>``Customs Modernization Act'').</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>On August 14, 1991, Customs published a notice in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(56 FR 40283) proposing to change its position</textblock>
    <textblock>with respect to the definition of ``passenger'' for purposes of the</textblock>
    <textblock>coastwise passenger statute (46 U.S.C. App. 289). Customs stated</textblock>
    <textblock>that it was considering the revocation of its position that: (a)</textblock>
    <textblock>Persons transported free of charge as an inducement for patronage</textblock>
    <textblock>or good will are not passengers; and (b) persons transported free</textblock>
    <textblock>of charge who are less than substantially connected with the</textblock>
    <textblock>operation, navigation, ownership, or business of a vessel are not</textblock>
    <textblock>passengers. The effect of these proposed changes of position</textblock>
    <textblock>would have been that persons considered to be passengers as a</textblock>
    <textblock>result of the changes could not have been transported between</textblock>
    <textblock>coastwise points or in the coastwise trade unless they were</textblock>
    <textblock>transported in United States coastwise-qualified vessels.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed changes of position would not have effected any</textblock>
    <textblock>actual change to the specific wording of the definition of</textblock>
    <textblock>passenger contained in 19 CFR 4.50(b). Customs will consider</textblock>
    <textblock>proposing an amendment to the definition of passenger in 19 CFR</textblock>
    <textblock>4.50(b) as part of a proposed revision to its vessel regulations</textblock>
    <textblock>which Customs expects will occur as a result of the recent</textblock>
    <textblock>enactment of title VI of the North American Free Trade Agreement</textblock>
    <textblock>Implementation Act (Public Law 103-182; the ``Customs</textblock>
    <textblock>Modernization Act''). In view of the enactment of the Customs</textblock>
    <textblock>Modernization Act, and the many regulatory changes which will</textblock>
    <textblock>occur as a result, Customs believes that it is not appropriate to</textblock>
    <textblock>go forward with the proposed changes of position at this time.</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, the proposal is withdrawn.</textblock>
