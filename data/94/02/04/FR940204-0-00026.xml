    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA is approving revisions to the particulate emission regulations of the Alabama State Implementation Plan (SIP) submitted by the State of Alabama through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management on September 23, 1985. The revisions include specific regulations for coke ovens for Gulf States Steel Corporation, formerly Gadsden Steel Company, formerly Republic Steel Corporation. These regulations were revised to ensure that the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for particulate matter will continue to be maintained in Etowah County, Alabama.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On September 23, 1985, the State of Alabama through the Alabama Department of Environmental Management submitted revisions to the Alabama SIP to address air emissions from steel mills located in Etowah County. The air quality with regard to particulate matter in Etowah County, Alabama, is predominantly influenced by the operation of Gulf States Steel Corporation. Therefore, mitigation measures concentrate on those processes peculiar to the making of steel. The following is a detailed summary of the revisions to the Alabama SIP which EPA is approving in this action.</textblock>
    <textblock>The State's original implementation plan for the control of particulate emissions from steel mills contained two broadly applicable regulations. Visible emissions were regulated by section 335-3-4-.01 (formerly 4.1) and the amount of particulate mass emitted was regulated by the general process weight provisions of section 335-3-4-.04 (formerly 4.4). In general, those regulations adequately addressed particulate emissions from stacks, but could not be effectively applied to control process fugitive emissions. These regulations were difficult to enforce because there was no easy or accurate way to measure actual emissions.</textblock>
    <textblock>In order to remedy the problems associated with these original regulations, the State adopted source-specific regulations governing the distinctive emission processes associated with coke making. The coke oven regulations were adopted by the Alabama Air Pollution Control Commission on June 12, 1974. The regulations were submitted to EPA for approval as a revision to the Alabama SIP on June 20, 1974. EPA approved the regulations on August 28, 1975 (40 FR 39503). A summary of these coke oven emission regulations is provided in this notice in order to provide an understanding of the control strategy pertinent to this notice. Many of these regulations remain an integral part of the strategy. The regulations were originally codified under section 4.9 but have been recodified as follows.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 335-3-4-.09(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>_This section requires that all reasonable measures be applied to prevent emissions from the unloading and transfer of coal and coke.</textblock>
