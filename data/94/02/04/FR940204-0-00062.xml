    <textblock>Part of the environmental review process under the California Environmental Quality Act for projects that result in the loss of sites supporting these plant species generally includes the development of mitigation plans. Such plans may involve establishing long-term protection for certain sites by designating them as ``reserves,'' enhancing degraded sites to improve or extend suitable habitat, transplanting affected species to an off-site location, and/or creating artificial habitat. Proponents for the Glenwood Estates Development proposed a mitigation plan that calls for establishing reserves that would set aside 0.9 acre of habitat occupied by approximately 90 percent of the total number of</textblock>
    <textblock>Chorizanthe robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>hartwegii</textblock>
    <textblock>individuals, as well as an additional 6 acres of suitable but unoccupied habitat (APC International, Inc. 1992). Although the project proponents have the intention of setting aside the largest concentrations, and therefore the largest number of individuals of</textblock>
    <textblock>C. robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>hartwegii,</textblock>
    <textblock>the distribution of this plant is already so restricted that any loss would be considered biologically significant. A review of past mitigation measures applied to other species similar to</textblock>
    <textblock>C. robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>hartwegii</textblock>
    <textblock>in their very narrow distributions have indicated that such measures failed to adequately effect long-term protection. Frequently cited reasons include inadequate reserve size, inadequate buffer zones, and inappropriate adjacent land uses that result in the disruption of ecological processes affecting soil and water conditions and pollinator and seed disperser populations (Howald 1992). Furthermore, areas that currently support smaller concentrations of this plant or areas of suitable habitat that are currently unoccupied by the plant would not be protected from habitat alteration and would be lost for future recovery efforts.</textblock>
    <textblock>Mitigation plans for State-listed species are typically formalized in a Mitigation Agreement between CDFG and the project proponent. Although</textblock>
    <textblock>C. robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>hartwegii</textblock>
    <textblock>is not currently State listed, CDFG attempted to secure a Mitigation Agreement because of its concern over the effects of the project to the plant. However, CDFG was not able to reach an agreement with the Glenwood Development Company. CDFG believes that the reserves, as delineated, will not be adequate to ensure long-term viability of the resources targeted for protection. Furthermore, no compensation was offered for the loss of resources that will not be avoided (Hunter,</textblock>
    <textblock>in litt.,</textblock>
    <textblock>1993).</textblock>
    <textblock>The city of Scotts Valley has regulatory authority over 90 percent of the lands within the proposed project area. They approved the project acknowledging that it would have unmitigable impacts to</textblock>
    <textblock>Chorizanthe robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>hartwegii</textblock>
    <textblock>by issuing a statement of overriding considerations. Although the California Environmental Quality Act process allows for such approval, the goal of requiring mitigation that secures long-term protection for plants that qualify for State listing has not been achieved. The Santa Cruz County Planning Commission, which has regulatory authority over the remaining 10 percent of the lands within the proposed project area, recently rejected approval of the project. This decision, however, is being appealed by the project proponent to the County Board of Supervisors.</textblock>
    <textblock>E. Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</textblock>
    <textblock>The introduction of non-native species to coastal dunes for the purpose of sand stabilization adversely affected native dune flora, probably including</textblock>
    <textblock>Chorizanthe robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>Chorizanthe pungens</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>pungens.</textblock>
    <textblock>Such introduced species as European beach grass (</textblock>
    <textblock>Ammophila arenaria</textblock>
    <textblock>), sea-fig (</textblock>
    <textblock>Carpobrotus</textblock>
    <textblock>ssp.), and iceplant (</textblock>
    <textblock>Mesembryanthemum</textblock>
    <textblock>ssp.) invaded dune habitats and in many cases outcompeted the native flora. While public agencies are now aware of the adverse impacts of introducing non-native species, efforts to restore dune habitats with native species may also result in further impacts to sensitive plants, if not done properly.</textblock>
    <textblock>As currently proposed, the Glenwood Estates Development would destroy numerous small colonies of</textblock>
    <textblock>Chorizanthe robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>hartwegii,</textblock>
    <textblock>but would set aside several reserves for the densest concentrations of the plant. These reserves would be left as small islands within the golf course portion of the project. Grading of adjacent portions of the course may alter surface and subsurface hydrologic processes of these remaining reserves. In addition, the reserves may be affected by the application of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers on the adjacent course. Application of such chemicals may alter the balance of nutrients in the soil and may affect the ability of</textblock>
    <textblock>C. robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>hartwegii</textblock>
    <textblock>to survive, either directly or through competition with exotic species that may be favored by application of these chemicals (Edmondson 1987; Carl Wishner, botanist, pers. comm., 1993).</textblock>
    <textblock>Typically, annuals and other monocarpic plants (individuals that die after flowering and fruiting), such as the four plants that are the subject of this final rule, are vulnerable to random fluctuations or variation (stochasticity) in annual weather patterns and other environmental factors (Huenneke</textblock>
    <textblock>et al.</textblock>
    <textblock>1986). All four of the plants are restricted to habitats of limited distribution within a small geographic range. All but</textblock>
    <textblock>Chorizanthe pungens</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>pungens</textblock>
    <textblock>are currently vulnerable to stochastic extinction due to their small and isolated populations.</textblock>
    <textblock>Chorizanthe robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>hartwegii</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>Chorizanthe robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>are particularly threatened by this factor as</textblock>

    <textblock>hartwegii</textblock>
    <textblock>is found on Santa Cruz mudstones and Purisima sandstones within a 1-mile diameter in Scotts Valley in the Santa Cruz Mountains and</textblock>
    <textblock>C. robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>var.</textblock>
    <textblock>robusta</textblock>
    <textblock>is found in only three locations over a 12-mile range in southern Santa Cruz County.</textblock>
