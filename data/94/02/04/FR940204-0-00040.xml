    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Paperwork Reduction Act's (PRA) provisions on information collection are triggered when a health care facility (facility) files an attestation with the Department of Labor (DOL or Department), as a condition for being able to use the services of a nonimmigrant registered nurse entering the United States on an H-1A visa. The attestation is a prerequisite to filing a petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) for H-1A nurses. Facilities are required to file attestations with DOL attesting to certain conditions and to steps taken to recruit and retain U.S. nurses in order to reduce dependence on nonimmigrant alien nurses.</textblock>
    <textblock>The attestations, required under sections 101(a)(15)(h)(i)(a) and 212(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, pertain to substantial disruption in the delivery of health care services, absence of adverse effect on wages and working conditions of similarly employed registered nurses, payment of wages to nonimmigrant nurses employed by the facility at wage rates paid to other registered nurses similarly employed by the facility, taking timely and significant steps designed to recruit and retain U.S. nurses to reduce dependence on nonimmigrant nurses, absence of a strike or lockout, and giving appropriate notice of filing. Attestation is made on Form ETA 9029, a copy of which is published as an appendix to this document, but which will not be published in the CFR.</textblock>
    <textblock>The attestation process is administered by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) of DOL, while complaints and investigations regarding the attestations are handled by the Wage and Hour Division of DOL's Employment Standards Administration (ESA).</textblock>
    <textblock>Public reporting burden for collection of information the first year a facility submits an attestation is estimated to average 8 to 10 hours for searching existing information/data sources and gathering and compiling the data at the facility the first year that a facility submits an attestation. In the second and subsequent years, the reporting burden, based on operating experience, is expected to average about 3 hours.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reviewed the collection of information requirements for facilities filing attestations as a condition to petition the INS for H-1A nurses in accordance with the PRA, 44 U.S.C. 3501</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.,</textblock>
    <textblock>and 5 CFR part 1320. OMB approved all information requirements contained in 20 CFR part 655, subpart D, and 29 CFR part 504, subpart D, under OMB clearance number 1205-0305.</textblock>
    <textblock>On January 31, 1994, OMB approved the information collection provisions until September 1995.</textblock>
