    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) proposes to make the provisions of the emergency rule listing the Pacific pocket mouse (</textblock>
    <textblock>Perognathus longimembris pacificus</textblock>
    <textblock>) as an endangered species pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (Act), permanent. Although a minimum of 8 populations of the Pacific pocket mouse encompassing 29 sites from Los Angeles County south to San Diego County formerly occurred, the only known extant population occurs on the Dana Point Headlands in Orange County, California. Depredation by feral and/or domestic cats and a proposed development threaten the continued existence of the remaining population. Additional data and information, which may assist the Service in making a final decision on this proposed action, is solicited on the status of this species.</textblock>
