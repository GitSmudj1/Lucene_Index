    <textblock>Proposed Foreign-Trade Zone; Richmond, VA (Richmond-Petersburg Port of Entry); Application and Public Hearing</textblock>
    <textblock>An application has been submitted to the Foreign-Trade Zones Board (the Board) by the Capital Region Airport Commission, requesting authority to establish a general-purpose foreign-trade zone in Richmond, within the Richmond-Petersburg Customs port of entry. The application was submitted pursuant to the provisions of the Foreign-Trade Zones Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 81a-81u), and the regulations of the Board (15 CFR part 400). It was formally filed on January 24, 1994. The applicant is authorized to make the proposal under Virginia Acts of Assembly 1980, Chapter 380, ยง8.10.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed foreign-trade zone would involve the Richmond International Airport complex (2,055 acres), some 5 miles east of the City of Richmond. The complex is owned by the Airport Commission, which plans to contract with a qualified firm for operation of the zone.</textblock>

Several firms have indicated an interest in using zone procedures for warehousing/distribution of such items as automobile parts, laboratory equipment, musical instruments and pharmaceuticals. Specific manufacturing approvals are not being sought at this time. Requests would be made to the Board on a case-by-case basis.</textblock>
