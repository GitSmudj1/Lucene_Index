    <textblock>The FAA has also reviewed and approved Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 767-32A0125, dated November 11, 1993, that describes procedures for installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect. The alert service bulletin also describes procedures for adjustment of the torque of the ``B''-nut on the hydraulic line connection to the disconnect fitting. Accomplishment of the installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect will provide an improved installation of the brake disconnect, which keeps the brake hose connected to the brake. (The alert service bulletin limits the effectivity to Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon brakes, line positions 132 through 518, inclusive.)</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA has also reviewed and approved Boeing Service Bulletin 767-32A0126, Revision 1, dated January 13, 1994, that describes procedures for performing a visual inspection of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel to detect cracks, bronze transfer, corrosion, chrome discoloration, and areas of missing chrome plate; replacement of any damaged brake rod pin assembly; modification of the brake rod pin assembly; installation of the modified brake rod pin into the brake housing and brake rod; and installation of a new brake attach pin retainer configuration. The service bulletin also describes a visual inspection to detect cracking, deformation, and/or missing pieces of material in the brake housing, and the bushings in the end of the brake rod; and repair or replacement as necessary. Accomplishment of this inspection and modification of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel, inspection of certain MLG bushings, and replacement or repair as necessary, will help prevent the possibility of a fracture developing in a cross bolt. The manufacturer has installed this modification on airplanes (equipped with carbon brakes) in production, starting at line number 519 and subsequent. (The service bulletin limits the effectivity to Model 767 series airplanes equipped with carbon brakes, line positions 132 through 518, inclusive.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Since an unsafe condition has been identified that is likely to exist or develop on other Model 767 series airplanes of the same type design, this AD is being issued to prevent failure of two or more MLG brakes, which could adversely affect the stopping performance of the airplane. This AD requires the following actions:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Repetitive surface temper etch inspections and fluorescent magnetic particle inspections to detect cracks or thermal damage of the existing brake rod inner cylinder bolts on the MLG wheels and brakes, and replacement of cracked or damaged bolts with new or serviceable bolts;</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Repetitive visual inspections to detect cracking of the inner cylinder fork lug bushings and the brake rod bushings at the inner cylinder fork lug end;</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Installation of retainer plates at each MLG brake disconnect and adjustment of the torque of the ``B''-nut on the hydraulic line connection to the disconnect fitting;</textblock>
    <textblock>4. A one-time visual inspection of the brake rod pin assembly at each MLG wheel to detect cracks, bronze transfer, corrosion, chrome discoloration, and areas of missing chrome plate; replacement of any damaged brake rod pin assembly with a new or serviceable assembly; modification of the brake rod pin assembly; installation of the modified brake rod pin into the brake housing and brake rod; and installation of a new brake attach pin retainer configuration;</textblock>
    <textblock>5. A one-time visual inspection to detect cracking, deformation, and/or missing pieces in the bushings in the brake housing, and the bushings in the end of the brake rod; and</textblock>
    <textblock>6. Subsequent repair or replacement of any cracked and/or deformed bushings, and/or any bushings having missing pieces of material.</textblock>
    <textblock>The actions are required to be accomplished in accordance with the service bulletins described previously.</textblock>
