  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>NOAA issues this final rule to implement gear requirements for vessels fishing for northern shrimp in the Northeast multispecies fishery during the 1993/94 fishing season. Vessels fishing for or possessing northern shrimp in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and all Federally permitted fishing vessels fishing for or possessing northern shrimp are required to install and use a finfish excluder device throughout the fishing season and throughout the range. The intent of this requirement is to reduce the bycatch of groundfish in the small-mesh northern shrimp fishery.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations implementing Amendment 4 (56 FR 24724, May 31, 1991) to the Fishery Management Plan for the Northeast Multispecies Fishery (FMP) include a measure that requires the New England Fishery Management Council (Council) to make necessary recommendations to the Director, Northeast Region, NMFS (Regional Director), on gear requirements for vessels fishing for northern shrimp.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Council's recommendation for the 1993/94 fishery that any vessel catching, harvesting or landing northern shrimp be required to use a finfish excluder device, particularly the Nordmore Grate (grate), with a rigid or semi-rigid bar spacing of not more than one inch (2.54 cm), throughout the shrimp season, was published on November 8, 1993 (58 FR 59232). The notice also provided a summary of an economic analysis contained in an environmental assessment prepared by the Council to accompany its recommendation. The publication of the recommendation initiated a comment period, which concluded on December 3, 1993.</textblock>
    <textblock>Comments and Responses</textblock>
    <textblock>A comment on the Council's recommendation was received from the Center for Marine Conservation, which supported approval of the Council's recommendation.</textblock>
    <textblock>This comment was considered in the agency's decision to approve the Council's recommendation.</textblock>
    <textblock>Changes From the Proposed Rule to the Final Rule</textblock>
    <textblock>Changes were made to all of the sections under ยง651.20(b)(3)(vi), inclusive, to conform to the finfish excluder device requirement as published in the proposed rule to Amendment 5 to the multispecies FMP (58 FR 57774). All of the changes are for clarity and brevity. No substantive changes were made.</textblock>
    <textblock>Classification</textblock>
    <textblock>This action is authorized by 50 CFR part 651 and is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law.</textblock>
    <textblock>The General Counsel Department of Commerce certified to the Small Business Administration that the proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. As a result, a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, NOAA, has determined that it is impracticable and contrary to the public interest to delay for 30 days the effective date of this rule under section 553(d) of the Administrative Procedure Act. Fishermen harvesting northern shrimp already are required to use Nordmore grates in state waters of Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts and have had ample time to adjust to this requirement. Implementation of this same requirement in the EEZ provides similar requirements for fishermen throughout the range of the fishery.</textblock>
