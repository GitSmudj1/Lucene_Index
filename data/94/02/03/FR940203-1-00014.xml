  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document proposes the supersedure of an existing airworthiness directive (AD), applicable to certain Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, that currently requires inspecting to detect cracking in certain lower lobe lap joints, and repair, if necessary; reporting any findings of discrepancies; replacing certain countersunk fasteners with protruding head fasteners; and verifying that the airplanes do not have certain countersunk fasteners. This action would increase the area to be inspected, delete the reporting requirement, and expand the applicability. This proposal is prompted by reports of fuselage skin cracking in certain areas and findings of additional countersunk fasteners. The actions specified by the proposed AD are intended to prevent reduced structural integrity of the fuselage.</textblock>

    <textblock>Discussion</textblock>
    <textblock>On December 19, 1989, the FAA issued AD 90-01-07, Amendment 39-6440 (55 FR 255, January 4, 1990), applicable to Boeing Model 747 series airplanes, having line numbers 201 through 765, inclusive, to require:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Repetitively inspecting to detect cracking in certain lower lobe lap joints, and repair, if necessary;</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Reporting any findings of discrepancies;</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Replacing certain countersunk fasteners with protruding head fasteners; and</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Verifying that airplanes do not have certain countersunk fasteners.</textblock>
    <textblock>That action was prompted by reports of cracking in the lap joint of stringer 34 near the interface with the wing-to-body fairing. The requirements of that AD are intended to prevent in-flight depressurization due to undetected cracks in the skin of the airplane.</textblock>
