    <textblock>Pre-application Consultation:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) To provide potential applicants with the maximum degree of relevant information at an early phase of project planning, the Corps will increase its efforts to encourage pre-application consultations in accordance with regulations at 33 CFR 325.1(b). Furthermore, while encouraging pre-application consultation, the Corps will emphasize the need for early consultation concerning mitigation requirements, if impacts to aquatic resources may occur. The Corps is responsible for initiating, coordinating, and conducting pre-application consultations and other discussions and meetings with applicants regarding Department of the Army permits. This may not apply in instances where the consultation is associated with the review of a separate permit or license required from another Federal agency (e.g., the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission or the Nuclear Regulatory Commission) or in situations where resource agencies perform work for others outside the context of a specific Department of the Army permit application (e.g., the conservation Reserve Program and technical assistance to applicants of Federal grants).</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) For those pre-application consultations involving activities that may result in impacts to aquatic resources, the Corps will provide EPA, FWS, NMFS (as appropriate), and other appropriate Federal and State agencies, a reasonable opportunity to participate in the pre-application process. The invited agencies will participate to the maximum extent possible in the pre-application consultation, since this is generally the best time to consider alternatives for avoiding or reducing adverse impacts. To the extent practical, the Corps and the Federal resource agencies will develop local procedures (e.g., teleconferencing) to promote reasonable and effective pre-application consultations within the logistical constraints of all affected parties.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. Applications for Individual Permits:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) The Corps is responsible for determining the need for, and the coordination of, interagency meetings, requests for information, and other interactions between permit applicants and the Federal Government. In this regard, Federal resource agencies will contact the Corps to discuss and coordinate any additional need for information for the applicant. The Corps will cooperate with the Federal resource agencies to ensure, to the extent practical, that information necessary for the agencies to carry out their responsibilities is obtained. If it is determined by the Corps that an applicant meeting is necessary for the exchange of information with a Federal resource agency and the Corps chooses not to participate in such a meeting, the Federal resource agency will apprise the Corps, generally in writing, of that agency's discussions with the applicant. Notwithstanding such meetings, the Corps is solely responsible for permit requirements, including mitigation and other conditions_the Federal resource agencies must not represent their views as regulatory requirements. In circumstances where the Corps meets with the applicant and develops information that will affect the permit decision, the Corps will apprise the Federal resource agencies of such information.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Consistent with 33 CFR part 325, the Corps will ensure that public notices contain sufficient information to facilitate the timely submittal of project-specific comments from the Federal resource agencies. The resource agencies comments will provide specific information and/or data related to the proposed project site. The Corps will fully consider comments regarding the site from a watershed or landscape scale, including an evaluation of potential cumulative and secondary impacts.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) The Corps must consider cumulative impacts in reaching permit decisions. In addition to the Corps own expertise and experience, the Corps will fully consider comments from the Federal resource agencies, which can provide valuable information on cumulative impacts. Interested Federal agencies are encouraged to provide periodically to the Corps generic comments and assessments of impacts (outside the context of a specific permit application) on issues within the agencies' area of expertise.</textblock>
    <textblock>7. General Permits:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) The Corps is responsible for proposing potential general permits, assessing impacts of and comments on proposed general permits, and deciding whether to issue general permits. The Corps will consider proposals for general permits from other sources, including the Federal resource agencies, although the final decision regarding the need to propose a general permit rests with the Corps. Other interested Federal agencies should provide comments to the Corps on proposed general permits. These Federal agency comments will be submitted consistent with established agreements and regulations and will focus on the Federal agencies' area(s) of expertise. The Corps will fully consider such agencies' comments in deciding whether to issue general permits, including programmatic general permits.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) The Corps is responsible for initiating and conducting meetings that may be necessary in developing and evaluating potential general permits. Any discussions with a State or local Government regarding proposed programmatic general permits will be coordinated through and conducted by the Corps. Prior to issuing a programmatic general permit, the Corps will ensure that the State or local program, by itself or with appropriate conditions, will protect the aquatic environment, including wetlands, to the level required by the section 404 program.</textblock>
