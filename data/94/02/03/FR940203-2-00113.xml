    <textblock>Examples of Statewide Activities.</textblock>
    <textblock>Reference to ``related services personnel'' has been added to the list of those individuals in paragraph (c) for whom training could be provided by a grantee under this priority. In addition, the outreach activities in paragraph (b) have been revised to include the clause ``stimulating the development of partnerships in poor communities.'' And, paragraph (h) has been added to provide that States may work with ``localities to recruit and retain all students in School-to-Work Opportunities programs, including those from a broad range of backgrounds and circumstances.''</textblock>
    <textblock>(e)</textblock>
    <textblock>Allocation of Funds to Local Partnerships.</textblock>
    <textblock>When the notice of proposed priority was published, the Departments did not have the authority to require States to award subgrants to local partnerships with funds awarded under this competition. The 1994 Department of Education Appropriation Act (Pub. L. 103-112), included a provision authorizing grantees of funds under this competition to make subgrants to localities for carrying out School-to-Work Opportunities projects. In light of this new authority, the notice has been modified so that it now requires States receiving School-to-Work Opportunities Implementation grants under this competition to distribute to local partnerships 65 percent of the amounts they receive, as subgrants to localities. Under the pending legislation, we expect that this amount will increase to 75 percent in the second year, and 85 percent in each year thereafter.</textblock>
    <textblock>(f)</textblock>
    <textblock>Examples of Activities for Local Partnerships.</textblock>
    <textblock>New paragraphs (f), (l), (m), and (n) have been added so that included among allowable activities for local partnerships are: providing career exploration and awareness services, counseling and mentoring services, college awareness, and other services to prepare students for the transition from school to work; designing local strategies to provide adequate planning time and staff development activities for teachers, school counselors, and related services personnel; enhancing linkages between after school, weekend, and summer jobs, and opportunities for career exploration and school-based learning; and conducting outreach to all students in a manner that most appropriately meets their needs and the needs of their communities. Redesignated paragraph (g) has been changed to specifically include disabled students in graduation assistance programs.</textblock>
    <textblock>(g)</textblock>
    <textblock>Safeguards.</textblock>
    <textblock>A reference to labor standards has been added to paragraph (d) under ``Safeguards,'' to clarify that all existing labor standards must be applied to School-to-Work Opportunities systems funded under this competition. Under paragraph (d) as revised, States are required to provide all students with adequate and safe equipment and a safe and healthful workplace in conformity with all health, safety, and labor standards of Federal, State, and local law.</textblock>
    <textblock>(h)</textblock>
    <textblock>Selection Criteria for Evaluating Applications.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the discussion of the application review process, the Secretaries have clarified that, among the factors upon which the Secretaries will base their funding decisions are the replicability, sustainability, and innovation of the School-to-Work Opportunities plans described in the States' applications.</textblock>
    <textblock>(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>Selection Criteria</textblock>
    <textblock>(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Comprehensive Statewide System.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the ``Comprehensive Statewide System'' criterion, the Secretaries have made a revision to clarify that each State must propose a feasible plan for expanding the School-to-Work Opportunities system so that students in all parts of the State, including communities with high concentrations of poor and disadvantaged youth, will have the opportunity to participate in the State's School-to-Work Opportunities program within a reasonable period of time. This criterion is intended to ensure that State skill standards and methods of skill assessment are benchmarked to high quality standards and that students receiving skill certificates under the School-to-Work Opportunities program will have the opportunity to enter high-skill, high-wage, employment. Accordingly, the question ``Does the State's process for assessing skills reflect the needs of high performance workplaces as well as meet the requirements of broad clusters of related occupations and industries, rather than those of individual jobs or occupations?'' has been added to this criterion.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Involvement by Key Parties.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under this criterion, States will be evaluated on whether they propose effective and convincing strategies for obtaining the active and continued involvement in the School-to-Work Opportunities program of employers and other interested parties within the State. The criterion has been revised to reflect the Secretaries' intent that each State obtain input, from employers and other key parties, on the State's plans for a proposed School-to-Work Opportunities system, prior to submitting an application for funds under this competition.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Resources.</textblock>
    <textblock>The ``Resources'' selection criterion has been revised to include the question: ``Does the applicant limit administrative costs in order to maximize the amounts spent on delivery of services to students enrolled in School-to-Work Opportunities programs?'' Accordingly, applications will be reviewed to ascertain, among other things, whether States are planning to limit State and local partnership administrative costs in order to direct as large a portion of the funds received as possible toward providing academic and training services to students participating in their School-to-Work Opportunities programs.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4)</textblock>
    <textblock>Student Participation.</textblock>
    <textblock>The ``Student Participation'' selection criterion has been revised to include ``students with limited-English proficiency and academically talented students.'' The intent is to be consistent with the definition of the term ``All students'' (and to further clarify that School-to-Work Opportunities systems are intended to meet the needs of academically talented students).</textblock>
