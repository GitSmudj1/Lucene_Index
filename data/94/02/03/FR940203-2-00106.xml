    <textblock>Consideration of the reproposal of rules implementing the large trader reporting section of the Market Reform Act of 1990. The reproposed rules would: (1) Require a person that effects significant quantities of transactions in publicly traded securities to file Form 13H with the Commission disclosing such person's identity and accounts; (2) require broker-dealers that carry accounts to maintain records of transactions effected by or for such person's accounts; and (3) require such broker-dealers to report to the Commission upon request, transactions effected by or for such person's accounts.</textblock>
    <textblock>For further information, please contact Nicholas T. Chapekis at (202) 272-3115.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consideration of a release that would discuss the need to establish recordkeeping and reporting requirements for brokers and dealers that operate automated trading systems. The release would propose for comment a rule that would require registered broker-dealer sponsors of these systems to maintain participant, volume and transaction records, and to report system activity periodically to the Commission.</textblock>
