    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>At the request of Congress, the Department of Labor is conducting a review of the federal-state labor market information system. This notice requests comments from interested persons and organizations. The labor market information system is a cooperative effort involving the Department of Labor, state employment security agencies and other federal and state organizations. With federal funding and assistance, state agencies gather and disseminate information on employment, unemployment, the labor force, labor market trends, and job opportunities.</textblock>
    <textblock>The review will address user needs, legislative mandates, funding, coordination and management of the system, and the reliability of state and local labor force estimates. The review will also include proposals regarding overall policy and the future direction of the labor market information system.</textblock>
    <textblock>Signed at Washington, DC, this 27th day of January, 1994.</textblock>
