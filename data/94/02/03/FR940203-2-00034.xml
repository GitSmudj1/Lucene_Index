    <textblock>1.</textblock>
    <textblock>Purpose:</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of this guidance is to establish a process that clarifies for applicants when the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed its evaluation and at what point the applicant should contact the State concerning the status of the Section 401 Water Quality Certification and/or Coastal Zone Management (CZM) consistency concurrence. This process also allows for more accurate measurement of the total length of time spent by the Corps in evaluating permit applications (i.e., from receipt of a complete application until the Corps reaches a permit decision). For verification of authorization of activities under regional general permits, the Corps will use the appropriate nationwide permit procedures at 33 CFR 330.6.</textblock>
    <textblock>2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Background:</textblock>
    <textblock>a. A Department of the Army permit involving a discharge of dredged or fill material cannot be issued until a State Section 401 Water Quality Certification has been issued or waived. Also, a Department of the Army permit cannot be issued for a activity within a State with a federally-approved Coastal Management Program when that activity that would occur within, or outside, a State's coastal zone will affect land or water uses or natural resources of the State's coastal zone, until the State concurs with the applicant's consistency determination, or concurrence is presumed. In many cases, the Corps completes its review before the State Section 401 Water Quality Certification or CZM concurrence requirements have been satisfied. In such cases, applicants and the public are often confused regarding who to deal with regarding resolution of any State issues.</textblock>
    <textblock>b. The ``provisional permit'' procedures described below will facilitate a formal communication between the Corps and the applicant to clearly indicate that the applicant should be in contact with the appropriate State agencies to satisfy the State 401 Water Quality Certification or CZM concurrence requirements. In addition, the procedures will allow for a more accurate measurement of the Corps permit evaluation time.</textblock>
    <textblock>3.</textblock>
    <textblock>Provisional Permit Procedures:</textblock>
    <textblock>The provisional permit procedures are optional and may only be used in those cases where: (i) The District Engineer (DE) has made a provisional individual permit decision that an individual permit should be issued, and (ii) the only action(s) preventing the issuance of that permit is that the State has not issued a required Section 401 Water Quality Certification (or waiver has not occurred) or the State has not concurred in the applicant's CZM consistency determination (or there is not a presumed concurrence). In such cases, the DE may, using these optional procedures, send a provisional permit to the applicant.</textblock>
    <textblock>a. First, the DE will prepare and sign the provisional permit decision document. Then the provisional permit will be sent to the applicant by transmittal letter. (The sample transmittal letter at enclosure 1 contains the minimum information that must be provided.)</textblock>
    <textblock>b. Next, the applicant would obtain the Section 401 Water Quality Certification (or waiver) and/or CZM consistency concurrence (or presumed concurrence). Then the applicant would sign the provisional permit and return it to the DE along with the appropriate fee and the Section 401 Water Quality Certification (or proof of wavier) and/or the CZM consistency concurrence (or proof of presumed concurrence).</textblock>
    <textblock>c. Finally, the Corps would attach any Section 401 Water Quality Certification and/or CZM consistency concurrence to the provisional permit, then sign the provisional permit (which then becomes the issued final permit), and forward the permit to the applicant.</textblock>
    <textblock>d. This is the same basic process as the normal standard permit transmittal process except that the applicant is sent an unsigned permit (i.e., a provisional permit) prior to obtaining the Section 401 Water Quality Certification (or waiver) and/or CZM consistency concurrence (or presumed concurrence). (See enclosure 2.) A permit cannot be issued (i.e., signed by the Corps) until the Section 401 and CZM requirements are satisfied.</textblock>
    <textblock>4.</textblock>
    <textblock>Provisional Permit:</textblock>
    <textblock>A provisional permit is a standard permit document with a cover sheet. The cover sheet must clearly indicate the following: that a provisional permit is enclosed, that the applicant must obtain the section 401 Water Quality Certification or CZM concurrence from the State, that these documents must be sent to the Corps along with the provisional permit signed by the applicant, and that the Corps will issue the permit upon receipt of these materials. The issued permit is the provisional permit signed by the applicant and the Corps. The provisional permit must contain a statement indicating that the applicant is required to comply with the Section 401 Water Quality Certification, including any conditions, and/or the CZM consistency concurrence, including any conditions. At enclosure 3 is a sample cover sheet for the provisional permit.</textblock>
    <textblock>5.</textblock>
    <textblock>Provisional Permit Decision:</textblock>
    <textblock>The DE may reach a final decision that a permit should be issued provided that the State issues a Section 401 Water Quality Certification and/or a CZM concurrence. In order to reach such a decision the DE must complete the normal standard permit evaluation process, prepare and sign a decision document, and prepare a standard permit, including any conditions or mitigation (i.e., a provisional permit). The decision document must include a statement that the DE has determined that the permit will be issued if the State issues a Section 401 Water Quality Certification or waiver and/or a CZM concurrence, or presumed concurrence. The standard permit will not contain a condition that requires or provides for the applicant to obtain a Section 401 Water Quality Certification and/or CZM concurrence. Once the decision document is signed, the applicant has the right to a DA permit if the State issues a Section 401 Water Quality Certification or waiver and/or a CZM concurrence, or if concurrence is presumed. Once the decision document is signed, the permittee's right to proceed can only be changed by using the modification, suspension and revocation procedures of 33 CFR 325.7, unless the State denies the Section 401 Water Quality Certification or nonconcurs with the applicant's CZM consistency determination.</textblock>
