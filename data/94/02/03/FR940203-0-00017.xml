    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Treasury Decision (T.D.) 94-4, published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(59 FR 110) on January 3, 1994, contains the interim regulations that represent fulfillment of the obligations of the United States under Paragraph 1 of Annex 311 of the North American Free-Trade Agreement (NAFTA), as implemented under the North American Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act (Act) (Pub. L. 103-182, 107 Stat. 437 (December 8, 1993)).</textblock>
    <textblock>This document corrects some errors published in T.D. 94-4, which did not represent a proper transcription from the final version of edited drafts of the rules. Accordingly, some changes are made to remedy these transcription errors. (An example of a transcription error was the inadvertent omission of many tariff shift rules in §102.20(f)). Other changes, also, are necessary to correct typographical errors, which if left uncorrected can have the effect of changing the meaning of a specific provision. None of these corrections, however, represent a change of position by Customs with respect to any of the rules published in T.D. 94-4.</textblock>
    <textblock>Corrections of Publication</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, the publication on January 3, 1994 of the interim regulations (T.D. 94-4) (59 FR 110) is corrected as set forth below.</textblock>
