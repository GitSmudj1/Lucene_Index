    <textblock>Instrument:</textblock>
    <textblock>Mass Spectrometer with Automated Gas and Gas Chromatograph/Combustion Inlet Systems, Model MAT 252.</textblock>
    <textblock>Manufacturer:</textblock>
    <textblock>Finnigan MAT, Germany.</textblock>
    <textblock>Intended Use:</textblock>
    <textblock>The instrument will be used for stable isotope ratio measurements on organic compounds, gases at trace concentration, water samples and minerals. The objectives of the investigation are to determine the mechanisms and rates of biogeochemical processes through combined use of stable isotopic measurements with other studies. In addition, the instrument will be used in the courses Marine Sciences 105 (Chemical Oceanography), and Marine Sciences 199 (Biogeochemistry), and Marine Sciences 145 (Geochemistry), providing necessary instruction and training for science majors.</textblock>

    <textblock>Applicant:</textblock>
    <textblock>University of Arizona, Tree-Ring Laboratory, Building #58, 105 W. Stadium, Tucson, AZ 85721.</textblock>
    <textblock>Instrument:</textblock>
    <textblock>Automated Microvolume Inlet System.</textblock>
    <textblock>Manufacturer:</textblock>
    <textblock>Finnigan MAT GmbH, Germany.</textblock>
    <textblock>Intended Use:</textblock>
    <textblock>The instrument is an accessory to an existing mass spectrometer that is being used for stable-isotope ratio analysis of tree ring, soil and carbonate samples. Measurements will be used to develop relationships with environmental parameters (especially drought) which may be used to reconstruct paleo-environmental seasonal variation. The system represents an improvement in allowing small samples to be easily analyzed and permitting analysis in an automated mode. The instrument will also be used for educational purposes demonstrating the latest stable isotope ratio technology and research applications to graduate students in geosciences, hydrology, watershed management and ecology.</textblock>
