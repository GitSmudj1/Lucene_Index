    <textblock>(vi) Pursuant to §651.20(b)(3)(iv), beginning January 31, 1994, any vessel issued a permit under §651.4 that is fishing for, harvesting, possessing or landing northern shrimp, and any vessel fishing for, catching, harvesting or possessing northern shrimp in the EEZ, must have a properly configured and installed finfish excluder device in any net used to fish for or harvest northern shrimp, throughout the northern shrimp season as established or modified by the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission. The finfish excluder device must be configured and installed consistent with the following specifications (see Figure 6 for an example of a properly configured and installed finfish excluder device):</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) The finfish excluder device must be a rigid or semi-rigid grate consisting of parallel bars of not more than 1 inch (2.54 cm) spacing that excludes all fish and other objects, except those that are small enough to pass between its bars into the codend of the trawl.</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) The finfish excluder device must be secured in the trawl, forward of the codend, in such a manner that it precludes the passage of fish or other objects into the codend without said fish or objects have first passed between the bars of the grate.</textblock>
    <textblock>(C) A fish outlet or hole must be provided to allow fish or other objects that are too large to pass between the bars of the grate to pass out of the net. The aftermost edge of this outlet must be at least as wide as the grate at the point of attachment. Said fish outlet must extend forward from the grate toward the mouth of the net.</textblock>
    <textblock>(D) A funnel of net material is allowed in the lengthening piece of the net forward of the grate to direct catch towards the grate.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Figure 6 is added to part 651 as follows:</textblock>
