    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The Pacific pocket mouse (</textblock>
    <textblock>Perognathus longimembris pacificus</textblock>
    <textblock>) is 1 of 19 recognized subspecies of the little pocket mouse (</textblock>
    <textblock>Perognathus longimembris</textblock>
    <textblock>) (Hall 1981), a species that is widely distributed throughout arid regions of the western United States and northwestern Mexico. It is the smallest member of the family Heteromyidae, which consists of spiny pocket mice (</textblock>
    <textblock>Heteromys and Liomys</textblock>
    <textblock>), pocket mice (</textblock>
    <textblock>Perognathus and Chaetodipus</textblock>
    <textblock>), kangaroo rats (</textblock>
    <textblock>Dipodomys</textblock>
    <textblock>), and kangaroo mice (</textblock>
    <textblock>Microdipodops</textblock>
    <textblock>). Virtually all members of this family are nocturnal, granivorous, and have external, deep, fur-lined cheek pouches (Ingles 1965; P. Brylski, consulting mammalogist, pers. comm., 1993).</textblock>
    <textblock>The little pocket mouse is about 110 to 148 millimeters (mm) (4.3 to 6 inches (in)) long from nose to tip of tail. Its body pelage is spineless, bristle-free, and predominately brown, pinkish buff, or ochraceous buff above and light brown, pale tawny, buff, or whitish below. Two small patches of lighter hairs typically exist at the base of the ear. The tail can be either distinctly or indistinctly bicolored. The soles of the hind feet are hairy (Hall 1981).</textblock>
    <textblock>The Pacific pocket mouse is the smallest subspecies of the little pocket mouse, ranging from about 110 to 126 mm (4.3 to 4.9 in) long from nose to tip of tail. The tail, hind foot, and skull lengths and the size of skull structures are also the smallest of all little pocket mouse subspecies.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Los Angeles pocket mouse (</textblock>
    <textblock>Perognathus longimembris brevinasus</textblock>
    <textblock>), which occurs mostly northeast of and more interior than the Pacific pocket mouse, is the only other subspecies of little pocket mouse in cismontane southern California, is 125 to 145 mm (4.9 to 5.7 in) in total length, and has a longer tail, hind foot, and skull than the Pacific pocket mouse. The nasal bones in the skull of the Los Angeles pocket mouse are also considerably larger than those of the Pacific pocket mouse (Huey 1939).</textblock>
    <textblock>The Pacific pocket mouse was originally described by Mearns (1898) as a distinct species,</textblock>
    <textblock>Perognathus pacificus,</textblock>
    <textblock>based on the type specimen from San Diego County, California. von Bloeker (1931a,b) later recognized the Pacific pocket mouse as a distinct species, but subsequently concluded that the morphology of</textblock>
    <textblock>P. pacificus</textblock>
    <textblock>was not sufficiently distinct from</textblock>
    <textblock>P. longimembris</textblock>
    <textblock>to maintain the Pacific pocket mouse as a distinct species. von Bloeker reduced</textblock>
    <textblock>P. pacificus</textblock>
    <textblock>to</textblock>
    <textblock>P. longimembris pacificus.</textblock>
    <textblock>von Bloeker also described a second coastal subspecies,</textblock>
    <textblock>P. longimembris cantwelli,</textblock>
    <textblock>from El Segundo in Los Angeles County, California (von Bloeker 1932). After an analysis of 331 specimens of the little pocket mouse, Huey (1939) recognized</textblock>
    <textblock>P. l. pacificus</textblock>
    <textblock>to include the two subspecies described by von Bloeker (1932).</textblock>
    <textblock>Although a taxonomic review of</textblock>
    <textblock>P. longimembris</textblock>
    <textblock>may be appropriate, Williams (</textblock>
    <textblock>in litt.,</textblock>
    <textblock>1993) indicated that ``the Pacific pocket mouse is distinct.''</textblock>
    <textblock>The Pacific pocket mouse occurs within about 3 kilometers (km) (2 miles (mi)) of the immediate coast of southern California from Marina del Rey and El Segundo in Los Angeles County south to the vicinity of the Mexican border in San Diego County (Hall 1981, Williams 1986, Erickson 1993) and below 180 meters (m) (600 feet (ft)) in elevation (Erickson 1993). Although the range map in Hall (1981) suggests that the range of the Pacific pocket mouse may extend into northwestern Baja California, Mexico, this subspecies has never been recorded outside of California (Erickson 1993).</textblock>
    <textblock>The Pacific pocket mouse occurs on fine-grain, sandy substrates in the immediate vicinity of the Pacific Ocean (Mearns 1898, von Bloeker 1931a, Grinnell 1933, Bailey 1939). The Pacific pocket mouse inhabits coastal strand, coastal dunes, river alluvium, and coastal sage scrub growing on marine terraces (Grinnell 1933, Meserve 1972, Erickson 1993). Brylski (1993) detected the only known extant population on the Dana Point Headlands on loose sand substrates in a coastal sage scrub community dominated by California buckwheat (</textblock>
    <textblock>Eriogonum fasiculatum</textblock>
    <textblock>) and California sage (</textblock>
    <textblock>Artemisia californica</textblock>
    <textblock>).</textblock>
