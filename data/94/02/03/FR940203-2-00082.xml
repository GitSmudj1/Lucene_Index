    <textblock>Grove Communications, MGM Tower, Inc., Grove Company, Inc., Williston, ND; Termnation of Investigation</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to section 221 of the Trade Act of 1974, an investigation was initiated on November 15, 1993, in response to a worker petition which was filed on November 15, 1993, on behalf of workers at Grove Communications, MGM Tower, Inc., and Grove Company, Inc., Williston, North Dakota.</textblock>
    <textblock>All workers were separated from the subject firm more than one year prior to the date of the petition. Section 223 of the Act specifies that no certification may apply to any worker whose last separation occurred more than one year before the date of the petition. Consequently, further investigation in this case would serve no purpose, and the investigation has been terminated.</textblock>
