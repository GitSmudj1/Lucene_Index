    <textblock>Title:</textblock>
    <textblock>New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for Electric Arc Furnaces and Argon-Oxygen Decarburization Vessels (NSPS Subparts AA and AAa)-Information Requirements (EPA ICR No. 1060.07; OMB No. 2060-0038). This is a request for renewal of a currently approved information collection.</textblock>
    <textblock>Abstract:</textblock>
    <textblock>The owner or operator of electric arc furnaces and Argon-Oxygen decarburization vessels must provide EPA, or the delegated State regulatory authority with the following one-time-only reports: notification of the anticipated and actual dates of startup; notification of any physical or operational change to an existing facility which may increase the regulated pollutant emission rate; notification of demonstration of the continuous monitoring system (CMS); notification of the date of the initial performance test; and the results of the initial performance test. The owner or operator is also required to maintain records of the occurrence and duration of any startup, shutdown, or malfunction in the operation of an affected facility, or any period during which the monitoring system is inoperative.</textblock>
    <textblock>The owner or operator of electric arc furnaces controlled by a direct shell evacuation system must install and maintain a continuous monitoring device that continuously records pressure inside the electric arc furnaces (EAF), and records 15 minute integrated averages.</textblock>
    <textblock>The owner or operator must also submit semiannual reports of unacceptable operation of the affected facilities, and semiannual reports of exceedances of control device opacity.</textblock>
    <textblock>The notifications and reports enable EPA or the delegated State to determine that best demonstrated technology is installed and properly operated and maintained and to schedule inspections.</textblock>
    <textblock>Burden Statement:</textblock>
    <textblock>The burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 23 hours per response for reporting and 311 hours per recordkeeper annually. This estimate includes the time needed to review instructions, develop a recall plan, create and gather data, and review and store the information.</textblock>
    <textblock>Respondents: Owners or operators of electric arc furnaces and argon-oxygen decarburization vessels.</textblock>
