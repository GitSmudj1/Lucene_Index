    <textblock>The Proposed Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend 14 CFR part 39 of the Federal Aviation Regulations as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>49 U.S.C. App. 1354(a), 1421 and 1423; 49 U.S.C. 106(g); and 14 CFR 11.89.</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง39.13</textblock>
    <textblock>[Amended]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 39.13 is amended by removing amendment 39-6440 (55 FR 255, January 4, 1990), and by adding a new airworthiness directive (AD), to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Boeing:</textblock>
    <textblock>Docket 93-NM-183-AD. Supersedes AD 90-01-07, Amendment</textblock>
    <textblock>39-6440.</textblock>

    <textblock>Compliance:</textblock>
    <textblock>Required as indicated, unless accomplished previously.</textblock>
    <textblock>To prevent reduced structural integrity of the fuselage, accomplish the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>Restatement of Requirements of AD 90-01-07, Amendment 39-6440</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) For airplanes having line numbers 201 through 765: Conduct a high frequency eddy current (HFEC) inspection to detect cracking of the lower lobe lap joints in the vicinity of the wing-to-body fairing in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747-53A2312, dated June 12, 1989; or Revision 1, dated March 29, 1990; or Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992; at the time specified in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), or (a)(4) of this AD, as applicable. Repeat this inspection thereafter at intervals not to exceed 4,000 landings until the inspection required by paragraph (e) of this AD is accomplished.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) For airplanes that have accumulated less than 11,200 total landings as of February 5, 1990 (the effective date of AD 90-01-07): Prior to the accumulation of 11,000 landings or within the next 1,000 landings after February 5, 1990, whichever occurs later.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) For airplanes that have accumulated 11,200 or more total landings but less than 15,201 total landings as of February 5, 1990 (the effective date of AD 90-01-07): Within the next 1,000 landings after February 5, 1990, or prior to the accumulation of 15,500 total landings, whichever occurs earlier.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) For airplanes that have accumulated 15,201 or more total landings but less than 18,200 total landings as of February 5, 1990: Within the next 300 landings after February 5, 1990, or prior to the accumulation of 18,250 total landings, whichever occurs earlier.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) For airplanes that have accumulated 18,200 or more landings as of February 5, 1990: Within the next 50 landings after February 5, 1990.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) For airplanes having line numbers 201 through 765: Accomplish the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this AD.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) If any cracking is detected, prior to further flight, repair in accordance with Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747-53A2312, dated June 12, 1989; or Revision 1, dated March 29, 1990; or Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Prior to the accumulation of 20,000 total landings or within the next 3,000 landings after February 5, 1990 (the effective date of AD 90-01-07), whichever occurs later, modify the airplane by replacing countersunk fasteners in the upper row of the lower lobe lap joints in the vicinity of the wing-to-body fairing with protruding head fasteners, in accordance with the procedures described in the Boeing Alert Service Bulletin 747-53A2312, dated June 12, 1989; or Revision 1, dated</textblock>
    <textblock>March 29, 1990; or Revision 2, dated October 8, 1992.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) For purposes of complying with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this AD, the number of landings may be determined to equal the number of pressurization cycles where the cabin pressure differential was greater than 2.0 p.s.i.</textblock>
