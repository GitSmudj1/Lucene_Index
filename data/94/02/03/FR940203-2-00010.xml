    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The subject permit is requested under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1361</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>), the Regulations Governing the Taking and Importing of Marine Mammals (50 CFR part 216), the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended (16 U.S.C. 1531</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>), and the regulations governing the taking, importing, and exporting of endangered fish and wildlife (50 CFR part 222).</textblock>
    <textblock>This permit application is to incidentally harass marine mammals and sea turtles by a low frequency (60-80 Hz) sound source which will be located due west of Pt. Sur, California, at 850-950m depth. This sound source is part of the Acoustic Thermometry of Ocean Climate (ATOC) Program, and will be operated from approximately April 1, 1994, through March 31, 1996, with a maximum duty cycle of 8%, to conduct research on the effects of this source on marine mammals. The transmission bandwidth is approximately 20 Hz with a level of 195 dB (re: 1 uPa at 1m) and the spectrum level for the peak frequency (70 Hz) is 182 dB (re: 1 uPa at 1m). The effects of these transmissions on marine mammals and sea turtles will be monitored through passive acoustic tracking, satellite and recoverable tagging of ``indicator'' species, and visual surveys and observations.</textblock>
