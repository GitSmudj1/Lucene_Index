    <textblock>The agencies believe that additional time for comment is warranted due to the magnitude of the proposed changes, the complexity of the issues, the level of interest in the subject, and delays posed by the holiday season. The agencies are nonetheless pleased with the volume of comment received to date and believe that further comment will contribute measurably to improvements in the final rule. Therefore, the agencies have determined that it is appropriate to extend the comment period for an additional 30 days. This additional time should allow commenters adequate time fully to analyze and to respond to the proposal.</textblock>
    <textblock>All interested persons are invited to submit comments during this period.</textblock>
