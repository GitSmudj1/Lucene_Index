    <textblock>(b) Before issuing a determination recommending interim sanctions, the administrative law judge shall afford a party against whom such measures are proposed the opportunity to oppose them. The administrative law judge shall ordinarily decide any motion under this section no more than twenty (20) days after it is filed.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) The Commission shall review any recommended determination regarding the imposition of interim measures within twenty (20) days from its issuance or such other time as it may order. The Commission may impose any appropriate interim sanctions.</textblock>
