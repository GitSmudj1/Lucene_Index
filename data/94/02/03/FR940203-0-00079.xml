    <textblock>Permissible methods of taking; mitigation.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) U.S. citizens holding a Letter of Authorization issued pursuant to §228.6 may incidentally, but not intentionally, take marine mammals by harassment, injury or killing in the course of the detonation of conventional explosives up to the following maximum annual level within the area described in §228.51(a):</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) 12 detonations of 10,000 lbs (4,536 kg);</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) 2 detonations of 1,200 lbs (544 kg);</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) 10 detonations of 100 lbs (45 kg);</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) 10 detonations of 10 lbs (4.5 kg); and</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) 20 detonations of 1 lb (0.45 kg), provided all terms, conditions, and requirements of these regulations and such Letter of Authorization are complied with.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) The activity identified in paragraph (a) of this section must be conducted in a manner that minimizes, to the greatest extent possible, adverse impacts on marine mammals and their habitat. When detonating explosives, the following mitigation measures must be utilized:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) If marine mammals are observed within the designated safety zone prescribed in the Letter of Authorization, or on a course that will put them within the safety zone prior to detonation, detonation must be delayed until the marine mammals are no longer within the safety zone.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) If weather and/or sea conditions preclude adequate aerial surveillance, detonation must be delayed until conditions improve sufficiently for aerial surveillance to be undertaken.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) If post-test surveys determine that an injurious or lethal take of a marine mammal has occurred, the test procedure and the monitoring methods must be reviewed and appropriate changes must be made prior to conducting the next project.</textblock>
    <textblock>§228.54</textblock>
    <textblock>Prohibitions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notwithstanding takings authorized by §228.53 or by a Letter of Authorization issued under §228.6, the following activities are prohibited:</textblock>
