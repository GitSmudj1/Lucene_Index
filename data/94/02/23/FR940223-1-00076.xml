    <textblock>(i) It is fan-folded (flaked) and bound around its circumference.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) It is securely fastened to the deck or rail of the vessel; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) The towing wires, including the leg wires, are detached from the net.</textblock>

    <textblock>(i) The entire surface of the net is covered with canvas or other similar material that is securely bound;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) The towing wires, including the leg wires, are detached from the net; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) The codend is removed from the net and stored below deck.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Nets that are secured in a manner approved by the Regional Director, provided that the Regional Director has reviewed the alternative manner of securing nets and has published that alternative in the</textblock>

Summer flounder on board these vessels shall be stored in a standard 100-pound (45.3 kg) tote that has a liquid capacity of 18.2 gallons (70 liters), or a volume of not more than 4,320 cubic inches (2.5 cubic feet or 70.79 cubic cm), and that is readily available for inspection.</textblock>

    <textblock>(a) The Regional Director, in consultation with the Executive Director of the Council, may exempt any person or vessel from the requirements of this part for the conduct of experimental fishing beneficial to the management of the summer flounder resource or fishery.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) The Regional Director may not grant such exemption unless he/she determines that the purpose, design, and administration of the exemption is consistent with the objectives of the FMP, the provisions of the Magnuson Act, and other applicable law, and that granting the exemption will not:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Have a detrimental effect on the summer flounder resource and fishery; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Cause any quota to be exceeded; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Create significant enforcement problems.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Each vessel participating in any exempted experimental fishing activity is subject to all provisions of this FMP except those necessarily relating to the purpose and nature of the exemption. The exemption will be specified in a letter issued by the Regional Director to each vessel participating in the exempted activity. This letter must be carried aboard the vessel seeking the benefit of such exemption.</textblock>
