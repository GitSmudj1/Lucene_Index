    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule would establish Class E airspace extending from 700 feet above ground level (AGL) at Belle Plaine, Iowa. The development of new standard instrument approach procedures (SIAPs) at Belle Plaine Municipal Airport, Belle Plaine, Iowa, utilizing the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Very High Frequency Omnidirectional Range Tactical Air Navigation (VORTAC) and Belle Plaine, Iowa, non-directional beacon (NDB) located on the airport has made this proposal necessary. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate controlled airspace for aircraft executing these SIAPs at Belle Plaine, Iowa.</textblock>

    <textblock>The Proposal</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA is considering an amendment to part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR part 71) to establish Class E airspace at Belle Plaine, Iowa, extending upward from 700 feet above the surface excluding that portion which overlies the Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Class E airspace. The development of new SIAPs at Belle Plaine Municipal Airport has made this proposal necessary. The intended effect of this proposal is to provide adequate Class E airspace for aircraft executing the NDB or VOR/DME-A SIAPs at Belle Plaine Municipal Airport. The coordinates for this airspace docket are based on North American Datum 83. Class E airspace areas extending upward from 700 feet or more above the surface of the earth when designated in conjunction with an airport are published in Paragraph 6005 of FAA Order 7400.9A dated June 17, 1993, and effective September 16, 1993, which is incorporated by reference in 14 CFR 71.1 (58 FR 36298; July 6, 1993). The Class E airspace designation listed in this document would be published subsequently in the Order.</textblock>
    <textblock>The FAA has determined that this proposed regulation only involves an established body of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendments are necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under Executive Order 12866; (2) is not a ``significant rule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluation as the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matter that will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it is certified that this rule, when promulgated, will not have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.</textblock>
