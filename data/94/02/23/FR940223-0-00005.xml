    <textblock>This rule is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12866 because it has no impact on FmHA borrowers or other members of the public. It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts shall be published for comments, notwithstanding the exemption in 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. This action, however, is not published for proposed rulemaking because it involves only internal Agency management and publication for comment is unnecessary.</textblock>
