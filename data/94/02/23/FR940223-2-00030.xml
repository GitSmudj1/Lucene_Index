    <textblock>Re: Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver.</textblock>
    <textblock>Gentlemen: This is a Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver submitted pursuant to Title 10 CFR 430.27. Waiver is requested from the test procedure for measuring Furnace Energy Consumption as found in Appendix H to Subpart B of part 430.</textblock>
    <textblock>The current test procedure requires a 1.5 minute delay between burner ignition and the start of the circulating air blower. Goodman Manufacturing Co., L.P. is requesting waiver and authorization to use a 30 second delay instead of the specified 1.5 minutes for the blower to start after main burner ignition. Goodman Manufacturing intends to use a fixed timing control on our GMPV series central furnaces to gain additional energy savings that are achieved with the use of shorter blower on times.</textblock>
    <textblock>Test data for these furnaces with a 30 second delay indicated an increase in AFUE of 1.0 percentage point. The use of a 30 second delay reduces the appliance flue losses and therefore increases the furnace efficiency. Copies of confidential test data confirming this energy savings will be provided to you at your request.</textblock>
    <textblock>The current test procedure does not give Goodman Manufacturing credit for energy savings that can be obtained using fixed blower timings. The proposed ASRAE 103-1988 that is under consideration by DOE address the use of timed blower operation.</textblock>
    <textblock>Goodman Manufacturing is confident that this Waiver will be granted, and therefore we request an Interim Waiver be granted until a final ruling is made. Goodman, as well as other manufacturers of domestic furnaces, have been granted similar waivers.</textblock>
    <textblock>Manufacturers that domestically market similar products have been sent a copy of this Petition for Waiver and Application for Interim Waiver.</textblock>
    <textblock>␣␣Sincerely,</textblock>
