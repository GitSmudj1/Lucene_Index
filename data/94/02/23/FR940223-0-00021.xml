    <textblock>Statutory Authority</textblock>
    <textblock>5 U.S.C. 8149 provides the general statutory authority for the Secretary to prescribe rules and regulations necessary for administration and enforcement of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>5 U.S.C. 8145 provides that the Secretary of Labor shall administer the Act, may appoint employees to administer it, and may delegate powers conferred by the Act to any employee of the Department of Labor.</textblock>
    <textblock>5 U.S.C. 8103 (a) and (b) specifies that the Secretary may approve or authorize ``necessary and reasonable'' expenses to be paid from the Employees' Compensation Fund; may issue regulations governing the provision of services, appliances and supplies; and may prescribe the form and content of the authorization certificate.</textblock>
    <textblock>Classification</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of Labor has concluded that the regulatory proposal is not a significant regulatory action under the criteria of section 3(f) of Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The information collection requirements entailed by the proposed regulations have previously been approved by OMB.</textblock>
    <textblock>Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department believes that the rule will have ``no significant economic impact upon a substantial number of small entities'' within the meaning of section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Pub. L. 96-354, 91 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 605(b)). Although this rule will be applicable to small entities it should not result in or cause any significant economic impact, since the changes in the method of calculating the maximum allowable payments will not result in a significant difference in the outcome from that in the present method. The Secretary has so certified to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. Accordingly, no regulatory impact analysis is required.</textblock>
