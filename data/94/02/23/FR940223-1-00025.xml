    <textblock>§1124.63</textblock>
    <textblock>Announcement of the weighted average differential price, the producer nonfat milk solids price, and an estimated uniform price.</textblock>
    <textblock>The market administrator shall announce on or before the 14th day after the end of each month, the following prices for such month:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) The weighted average differential price;</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) The producer nonfat milk solids price; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) An</textblock>
    <textblock>estimated uniform price</textblock>
    <textblock>per hundredweight of milk which is computed by adding the weighted average differential price to the basic formula price.</textblock>
    <textblock>19. A new §1124.62 is added to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§1124.62</textblock>
    <textblock>Computation of producer nonfat milk solids price.</textblock>
    <textblock>The</textblock>
    <textblock>producer nonfat milk solids price</textblock>
    <textblock>shall be computed by the market administrator each month as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to §1124.60 (d) and (e) for all handlers who filed reports pursuant to §1124.30 and who made payments pursuant to §1124.71 for the preceding month;</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Divide the resulting amount by the total pounds of nonfat milk solids in producer milk; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Round to the nearest whole cent.</textblock>
    <textblock>20. Section 1124.70 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§1124.70</textblock>
    <textblock>Producer-settlement fund.</textblock>

    <textblock>§§1124.71 and 1124.75 and out of which shall be made all payments to handlers pursuant to §1124.72. Payments due a handler from the fund shall be offset against payments due from such handler.</textblock>
    <textblock>21. Section 1124.71 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§1124.71</textblock>
    <textblock>Payments to the producer-settlement fund.</textblock>

    <textblock>(a) The sum of:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The total obligation of the handler for such month as determined pursuant to §1124.60; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) For a cooperative association handler, the amount due from other handlers pursuant to §1124.73(d);</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) The sum of:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The value of milk received by the handler from producers at the applicable prices pursuant to §1124.73(a)(2) (i), (ii), and (iii);</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The amount to be paid by the handler to cooperative associations pursuant to §1124.73(d); and</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) The value at the weighted average differential price adjusted for the location of the plant(s) at which received (not to be less than zero) with respect to the total hundredweight of skim milk and butterfat in other source milk for which a value was computed for such handler pursuant to §1124.60(j); and</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) On or before the 25th day after the end of the month, each handler operating a plant specified in §1124.7(d) (2) and (3), if such plant is subject to the classification and pricing provisions of another order which provides for individual handler pooling, shall pay to the market administrator for the producer-settlement fund an amount computed as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Determine the quantity of reconstituted skim milk in filled milk disposed of as route disposition in the marketing area which was allocated to Class I at such other order plant. If reconstituted skim milk in filled milk is disposed of from such plant as route disposition in the marketing areas regulated by two or more market pool orders, the reconstituted skim milk assigned to Class I shall be prorated according to such disposition in each area.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Compute the value of the quantity assigned in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to Class I disposition in this area, at the Class I price under this part applicable at the location of the other order plant (but not to be less than the Class III price) and subtract its value at the Class III price.</textblock>
    <textblock>22. Section 1124.72 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§1124.72</textblock>
    <textblock>Payments from the producer-settlement fund.</textblock>
    <textblock>On or before the 18th day after the end of the month, the market administrator shall pay to each handler the amount, if any, by which the amount computed pursuant to §1124.71(b) exceeds the amount computed pursuant to §1124.71(a), less any unpaid obligations of such handler to the market administrator pursuant to §§1124.71, 1124.75, 1124.85, and 1124.86. However, if the balance in the producer-settlement fund is insufficient to make all payments pursuant to this section, the market administrator shall reduce uniformly such payments and shall complete such payments as soon as the necessary funds are available.</textblock>
