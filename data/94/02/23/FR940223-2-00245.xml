    <textblock>Complete the provided budget form identified as ``Attachment 3.'' A separate budget</textblock>
    <textblock>form must be completed for each proposal. A budget narrative should be attached to</textblock>
    <textblock>the form with containing any necessary explanatory information. Applicants must</textblock>
    <textblock>identify either on the form or in an attached narrative the source of its matching funds</textblock>
    <textblock>and whether it has a firm commitment for those funds.</textblock>
    <textblock>If activities under two or more DOT Programs are combined in a single proposal,</textblock>
    <textblock>separate budget forms must be completed to show program costs for each DOT</textblock>
    <textblock>Program, along with a separate aggregate budget form for the entire proposal.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. Assurances Signature Form.</textblock>
    <textblock>Complete the attached form identified as ``Attachment 4.''</textblock>
    <textblock>7.</textblock>
    <textblock>Certification Signature Form.</textblock>
    <textblock>Complete the attached form identified as ``Attachment</textblock>
    <textblock>5.''</textblock>

    <textblock>State Coordination and Evaluation Form.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed regulations issued under the National and Community Service Trust Act</textblock>
    <textblock>require that all community service projects be coordinated with their state community</textblock>
    <textblock>service plan in order to assure that the projects are building on existing programs and</textblock>
    <textblock>that they are not duplicative. Any community service organization submitting a</textblock>
    <textblock>proposal for a DOT Program must show evidence that the proposal has been reviewed</textblock>
    <textblock>and approved by the community service commission for the state in which it is located.</textblock>
    <textblock>Evidence of coordination can be shown by completion of the attached evaluation form</textblock>
    <textblock>(identified as ``Attachment 6'') by the state community service commission, by written</textblock>
    <textblock>correspondence from the state community service commission, or by documentation of</textblock>
    <textblock>a meeting with the state community service commission.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, DOT also asks that each proposal include a preliminary evaluation of the</textblock>
    <textblock>project by the state commission on national and community service for the state in</textblock>
    <textblock>which the project will be performed (the ``state commission''). An evaluation form to</textblock>
    <textblock>be completed by the state commission is attached (``Attachment 6''). Evaluations by the</textblock>
    <textblock>state commissions are optional and are not binding on DOT. However, DOT believes</textblock>
    <textblock>that any information from the state commissions would be extremely helpful in our</textblock>
    <textblock>review, and therefore strongly encourages all applicants to obtain an evaluation from</textblock>
    <textblock>their state commission.</textblock>
    <textblock>9. Standard Form 424</textblock>
    <textblock>(Request for Federal Assistance). Complete the attached</textblock>
    <textblock>Standard Form 424 identified as ``Attachment 7.''</textblock>
    <textblock>Please be sure that all forms have been signed by an authorized</textblock>
    <textblock>official who can legally represent the organization.</textblock>
