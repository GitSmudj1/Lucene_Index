    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of IMS Museum Leadership Initiatives is to advance outstanding projects that address issues of national concern to museums. In 1994, IMS will invite projects that partner museums, schools and communities to further education reform. Museums can effectively enhance standards-driven systemic reform by providing learning opportunities in every school discipline from history and science to mathematics and art. Museums' collections and exhibitions create an enriched learning environment that is not available in any other educational institution. The purpose of IMS Museum Leadership Initiatives awards will be to unleash and focus museums' potential to be powerful partners in education reform.</textblock>
    <textblock>In 1994, awards will be made for planning, including needs assessment, program development, pilot testing and analysis of results. IMS anticipates that competitive awards will be available to implement the plans in 1995. The maximum award for 1994 will be $40,000. Successful projects will build on existing museum-school partnerships and will address one or more of the following goals:</textblock>
    <textblock>•All children in America will start school ready to learn.</textblock>
    <textblock>•The high school graduation rate will increase to at least 90%.</textblock>
    <textblock>•American students will be competent in challenging academic content areas such as English, History, Math, Science, Geography, The Arts, Foreign Languages, and prepared for responsible citizenship.</textblock>
