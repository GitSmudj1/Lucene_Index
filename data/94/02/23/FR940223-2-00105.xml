    <textblock>On December 30, 1993, a petition was filed with the Commission and the Department of Commerce by Rhône-Poulenc Specialty Chemicals Co., Cranbury, NJ, alleging that an industry in the United States is materially injured or threatened with material injury by reason of LTFV imports of coumarin from the People's Republic of China. Accordingly, effective December 30, 1993, the Commission instituted antidumping investigation No. 731-TA-677 (Preliminary).</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice of the institution of the Commission's investigation and of a public conference to be held in connection therewith was given by posting copies of the notice in the Office of the Secretary, U.S. International Trade Commission, Washington, DC, and by publishing the notice in the</textblock>

    <textblock>of January 7, 1994 (59 F.R. 1026). The conference was held in Washington, DC, on January 20, 1994, and all persons who requested the opportunity were permitted to appear in person or by counsel.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission transmitted its determination in this investigation to the Secretary of Commerce on February 14, 1994. The views of the Commission are contained in USITC Publication 2733 (February 1994), entitled ``Coumarin from the People's Republic of China: Investigation No. 731-TA-677 (Preliminary).''</textblock>
