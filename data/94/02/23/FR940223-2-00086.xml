    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>In recent years, many important initiatives have been undertaken by regulatory authorities and industry associations to promote international harmonization of regulatory requirements. FDA has participated in many meetings designed to enhance harmonization and is committed to seeking scientifically based harmonized technical procedures for pharmaceutical development. One of the goals of harmonization is to identify and then reduce differences in technical requirements for drug development.</textblock>
    <textblock>ICH is concerned with harmonization of technical requirements for the registration of pharmaceutical products among three regions: The European Union, Japan, and the United States. The six ICH sponsors are the European Union, the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations, the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Japanese Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association, FDA, and the U.S. Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association.</textblock>
    <textblock>The ICH Steering Committee includes representatives from each of the organizing bodies and the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations (IFPMA), as well as observers from the World Health Organization, the Canadian Health Protection Branch, and the European Free Trade Area. The ICH Secretariat, which coordinates the preparation of documentation, is provided by IFPMA.</textblock>
    <textblock>ICH was organized to provide an opportunity for tripartite harmonization initiatives to be developed with input from regulatory and industry representatives and other interested parties. FDA is committed to ensuring that there is an opportunity for public comment through</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>notices on all of the guidelines developed as a result of the ICH harmonization initiatives. A number of ICH draft guidelines will be published soon in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>for public comment.</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of this public workshop is to provide an opportunity for the agency to present summary information about these documents and to respond to questions. In addition, general background information on ICH will be provided.</textblock>
    <textblock>This public workshop should be of interest to professional and consumer organizations and to the pharmaceutical industry.</textblock>
    <textblock>The status of the topics under consideration by ICH is as follows:</textblock>
