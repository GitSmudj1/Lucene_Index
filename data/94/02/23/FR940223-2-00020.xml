    <textblock>Grant Award Number: DE-FG06-94RL12858. Scope of Project: The proposed financial assistance award is a grant to The Nature Conservancy to fund a Biodiversity Inventory and Analysis Program on the Hanford Site. The activities will include inventorying plants, animals, and ecologically significant areas. In addition, the inventory work will assist DOE in identifying the location of threatened and endangered species on the Hanford Site and thereby afford the proper protection and/or mitigation required per the Threatened and Endangered Species Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Nature Conservancy is currently performing activities related to those proposed at the Hanford Site utilizing their own resources. The public benefit derived from these activities could be greatly enhanced with Department of Energy financial support. It has been determined that a grant instrument is appropriate since the Department of Energy anticipates limited direct involvement with the program.</textblock>
