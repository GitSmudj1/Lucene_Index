    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>On July 14, 1987, the Department published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(52 FR 26367) an antidumping duty order on solid urea from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) (52 FR 19557 (May 26, 1987)). On June 29, 1992, following dissolution of the USSR, the Department transferred the order to the Commonwealth of Independent States and the Baltic States, including Estonia. The substance of each new order remained the same and the estimated cash deposit rate of 68.26 percent was applied to exports from each independent state (57 FR 28828 (June 29, 1992)). This was the highest rate established in the LTFV investigation.</textblock>
    <textblock>On July 31, 1992, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.22(a), the Department received a timely request from the government of Estonia for an administrative review of the order for the time period July 1, 1991, through June 30, 1992. On August 10, 1992, the Department requested the U.S. Customs Service (Customs) to determine whether there was any record of entries of subject merchandise from the former USSR or any of the 15 independent republics during the review period. On August 13, 1992, Customs advised the Department that there was no record of any entries of the subject merchandise under HTS item 3102.10.00 during the period July 1, 1991 to June 30, 1992, from the former USSR or any of the 15 independent republics.</textblock>
    <textblock>Initiation of Review</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with ยง353.22(c) of the Department's regulations, we are initiating an administrative review of the antidumping duty order on solid urea from Estonia (case number A-447-801) and are concurrently issuing these preliminary results. This review covers all manufacturers and exporters, of solid urea from Estonia for the period July 1, 1991 through June 30, 1992, and its results will be applied to all manufacturers and exporters of solid urea from Estonia.</textblock>
