    <textblock>In any case, economic impacts would occur only through enforcement and cost-recovery actions, which EPA takes at its discretion on a site-by-site basis. EPA considers many factors when determining enforcement actions, including not only the firm's contribution to the problem, but also its ability to pay.</textblock>
    <textblock>The impacts (from cost recovery) on small governments and nonprofit organizations would be determined on a similar case-by-case basis.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the foregoing reasons, I hereby certify that this rule does not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Therefore, this regulation does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.</textblock>
