    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Implementation of the CAA will require small businesses to comply with specific regulations in order for areas to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) and reduce the emission of air toxics. In anticipation of the impact of these requirements on small businesses, the CAA requires that states adopt a PROGRAM, and submit this PROGRAM as a revision to the federally approved SIP. In addition, the CAA directs the EPA to oversee the small business assistance program and report to Congress on their implementation. The requirements for establishing a PROGRAM are set out in section 507 of Ttitle V of the CAA and the EPA guidance document Guidelines for the Implementation of section 507 of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments. In order to gain full approval, the state submittal must provide for each of the following PROGRAM elements:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The establishment of a Small Business Assistance Program (SBAP) to provide technical and compliance assistance to small businesses;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The establishment of a state Small Business Ombudsman to represent the interests of small businesses in the regulatory process; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) The creation of a Compliance Advisory Panel (CAP) to determine and report on the overall effectiveness of the SBAP.</textblock>
    <textblock>FDER has met the following requirements of section 507 of Title V of the CAA by submitting a SIP revision that implements the following required PROGRAM elements and implementation schedules. The PROGRAM will be fully implemented by November 15, 1994.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Small Business Assistance Program</textblock>
    <textblock>FDER has established a Small Business Section (SBS) which will incorporate the following six requirements set forth in section 507 of Title V of the CAA:</textblock>
    <textblock>A. The establishment of adequate mechanisms for developing, collecting and coordinating information concerning compliance methods and technologies for small business stationary sources, and programs to encourage lawful cooperation among such sources and other persons to further comply with the CAA;</textblock>
    <textblock>B. The establishment of adequate mechanisms for assisting small business stationary sources with pollution prevention and accidental release detection and prevention, including providing information concerning alternative technologies, process changes, products and methods of operation that help reduce air pollution;</textblock>
    <textblock>C. The development of a compliance and technical assistance program for small business stationary sources which assists small businesses in determining applicable permit requirements under the CAA in a timely and efficient manner;</textblock>
    <textblock>D. The development of adequate mechanisms to assure that small business stationary sources receive notice of their rights under the CAA in such manner and form as to assure reasonably adequate time for such sources to evaluate compliance methods and any relevant or applicable proposed or final regulation or standards issued under the CAA;</textblock>
