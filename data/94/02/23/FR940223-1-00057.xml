    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document proposes that an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established for residues of d-limonene (CAS Registry No. 5989-27-5) when used as an inert ingredient (solvent, fragrance) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops or raw agricultural commodities after harvest. This proposed regulation was requested by Orange Sol, Inc.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Orange Sol, Inc., 955 N. Fiesta Blvd., Ste. #1, Gilbert, AZ 85234, submitted pesticide petition (PP) number 3E4172, requesting that the Administrator, pursuant to section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a(e), amend 40 CFR 180.1001(c) by establishing an exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for residues of d-limonene (CAS Registry No. 5989-27-5) when used as an inert ingredient (solvent, fragrance) in pesticide formulations applied to growing crops or to raw agricultural commodities after harvest.</textblock>
    <textblock>Inert ingredients are all ingredients that are not active ingredients as defined in 40 CFR 153.125, and include, but are not limited to, the following types of ingredients (except when they have a pesticidal efficacy of their own): solvents such as alcohols and hydrocarbons; surfactants such as polyoxyethylene polymers and fatty acids; carriers such as clay and diatomacous earth; thickeners such as carrageenan and modified cellulose; wetting, spreading, and dispersing agents; propellants in aerosol dispensers;</textblock>
    <textblock>microencapsulating agents; and emulsifiers. The term ``inert'' is not intended to imply nontoxicity; the ingredient may or may not be chemically active.</textblock>
    <textblock>The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have been evaluated. As part of the EPA policy statement on inert ingredients published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of April 22, 1987 (52 FR 13305), the Agency set forth a list of studies which would generally be used to evaluate the risks posed by the presence of an inert ingredient in a pesticide formulation. Where it can be determined that the inert ingredient will present minimal or no risk, the Agency generally does not need some or all of the listed studies to rule on the proposed tolerance or exemption from the requirement of a tolerance for an inert ingredient. The Agency has decided that any data, in addition to that described below, for d-limonene will not need to be submitted. The rationale for this decision is described below:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. d-Limonene is a naturally occurring chemical found in high concentrations in citrus fruits and spices.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. d-Limonene is widely used as a fragrance in products such as perfumes and soaps.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. The probable lethal dose of 3-limonene is estimated at 1 pint.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. d-Limonene has been administered orally to successfully dissolve gall stones with no toxic effects observed after ingesting 1 fluid ounce.</textblock>
    <textblock>5. A battery of mutagenicity tests conducted on d-limonene resulted in no positive effects.</textblock>
    <textblock>6. A teratogenicity study in which pregnant rats were fed d-limonene (20 grams per kilogram) during gestation days 6 to 15 yielded results ``not considered teratogenic.''</textblock>
    <textblock>7. In a 2-year feeding study conducted by the National Toxicology Program, no carcinogenic activity was noted in female rats and mice and in male mice. Clear evidence of kidney-associated carcinogenic activity was noted in male rats. However, the NTP has concluded that the male rat kidney carcinogenicity is not predictive of mammalian carcinogenicity. Also, the Agency's position regarding compounds producing renal tubule tumors in male rats attributable solely to chemically induced alpha-2u-globuylin accumulation is that these tumors will not be used for human cancer hazard identification and that the associated nephropathy is not an appropriate endpoint for determining noncancer risks in humans.</textblock>
    <textblock>8. d-,l-, and dl-Limone are generally regarded as safe by the Food and Drug Administration when used as direct food additives (synthetic flavoring substance, adjuvant) under 21 CFR 182.60. The results of the NTP Bioassay did not change its GRAS status.</textblock>
    <textblock>Based upon the above information and review of its use, EPA has found that, when used in accordance with good agricultural practice, this ingredient is useful and a tolerance is not necessary to protect the public health. Therefore, EPA proposes that the exemption from the requirement of a tolerance be established as set forth below. Because of the low toxicity of this chemical, the Agency will consider expanding this exemption to include additional uses.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person who has registered or submitted an application for registration of a pesticide under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, as amended, which contains this chemical may request, within 30 days after publication of this document in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>, that this rulemaking proposal be referred to an Advisory Committee in accordance with section 408(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposed regulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document control number, [OPP-300320]. All written comments filed in response to this document will be available for public inspection in the Public Response and Program Resources Branch, at the Virginia address given above, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday, except legal holidays.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of section 2 of Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164; 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).</textblock>
