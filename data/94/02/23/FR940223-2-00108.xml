    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>The Commission further gives notice of the institution of final antidumping investigations Nos. 731-TA-659 and 660 (Final) under section 735(b) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673d(b)) to determine whether an industry in the United States is materially injured, or is threatened with material injury, or the establishment of an industry in the United States is materially retarded, by reason of imports from Italy and Japan of grain-oriented silicon electrical steel.1</textblock>
    <textblock>For further information concerning the conduct of these investigations, hearing procedures, and rules of general application, consult the Commission's Rules of Practice and Procedure, part 201, subparts A through E (19 CFR part 201), and part 207, subparts A and C (19 CFR part 207).</textblock>
  </summary>
  <footnote>
    <textblock>The products covered by these investigations are grain-oriented silicon electrical steel, which are flat-rolled alloy steel products containing by weight at least 0.6 percent of silicon, not more than 0.08 percent of carbon, not more than 1.0 percent of aluminum, and no other element in an amount that would give the steel the characteristics of another alloy steel, of a thickness of no more than 0.560 millimeter, in coils of any width, or in straight lengths which are of a width measuring at least 10 times the thickness. The subject products are provided for in subheadings 7225.10.00, 7226.10.10, and 7226.10.50 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States. In the scope section of its preliminary antidumping determinations, the Department of Commerce noted that the HTS numbers identified in the scope of the countervailing duty determination will be conformed with those listed in the antidumping determinations.</textblock>

    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>These investigations are being instituted as a result of an affirmative preliminary determination by the Department of Commerce that certain benefits which constitute subsidies within the meaning of section 703 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1671b) are being provided to manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Italy of grain-oriented silicon electrical steel, and as a result of affirmative preliminary determinations by the Department of Commerce that imports of grain-oriented silicon electrical steel from Italy and Japan are being sold in the United States at less than fair value within the meaning of section 733 of the Act (19 U.S.C. 1673b). The investigations were requested in a petition filed on August 26, 1993, by counsel on behalf of Allegheny Ludlum Corp., Pittsburgh, PA; Armco, Inc., Butler, PA; the Butler Armco Independent Union, Butler, PA; the United Steelworkers of America, Pittsburgh, PA; and the Zanesville Armco Independent Union, Zanesville, OH.</textblock>
