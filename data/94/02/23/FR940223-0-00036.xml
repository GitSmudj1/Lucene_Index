    <textblock>Judith Neibrief, Attorney, Office of the General Counsel, Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, 1200 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20005-4026, 202-326-4024 (202-326-4179 for TTY and TDD). (These are not toll-free numbers.)</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (``PBGC'') administers the pension plan termination insurance program under Title IV of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (``ERISA'') (29 U.S.C. 1301</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>). Part 2625 of its regulations (29 CFR part 2625), along with Treasury regulations under section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 412, minimum funding standards), describes certain legal obligations that arise incidental to a plan restoration under section 4047 of ERISA (29 U.S.C. 1347) and establishes procedures with respect to these obligations.</textblock>
    <textblock>Provisions of part 2625 currently reference temporary Treasury regulations for applying the minimum funding requirements to terminating or terminated single-employer plans restored by the PBGC (26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3T). The Internal Revenue Service (``IRS'') has now issued final regulations (26 CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3, TD 8494, 58 FR 54489, October 22, 1993). (The provisions of the final regulations on the restoration funding method differ from those referenced in part 2625 only in minor clarifications made by the IRS in response to comments.) The PBGC is amending §§2625.1(a) and 2625.2 (b) through (d) to reflect that action by substituting the final Treasury regulations for the temporary regulations.</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule also corrects the spelling of two words in §2625.2(b) (``amortization'' and ``restoration'') and adds language erroneously omitted from §2625.3(c) (``following a plan year''). (As worded, §2625.3(c) states that a restored plan may not use the alternative calculation method in §2610.23(c) of the premium regulation for any plan year for which Form 5500, Schedule B was not filed because the plan was terminated. However, as indicated in the premium regulation, the alternative calculation method requires use of a plan's Schedule B for the preceding plan year. Hence, this method is not available for a plan year that follows a plan year for which Schedule B was not filed, rather than for that plan year.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Because these amendments only reflect a change in the pertinent Treasury regulations (which were the subject of notice and comment rulemaking) and make corrections, the PBGC has for good cause found advance notice and public procedure thereon and a delayed effective date to be unnecessary (5 U.S.C. 553 (b)(B) and (d)(3)), and it is issuing these amendments as a final rule, effective immediately.</textblock>
    <textblock>E.O. 12866</textblock>
    <textblock>The PBGC has determined that this action is not a ``significant regulatory action'' under the criteria set forth in Executive Order 12866 because it will not have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities; create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency; materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 2625</textblock>
    <textblock>Employee pension plans, Pension insurance, Pensions.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the reasons set forth above, the PBGC is amending 29 CFR part 2625 as follows:</textblock>
