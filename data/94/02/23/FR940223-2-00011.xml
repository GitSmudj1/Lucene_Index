    <textblock>Notice of issuance of Letters of Authorization.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice is given that on February 8, 1994, NMFS issued a Letter of Authorization for a take of ringed seals incidental to on-ice seismic activities in the Beaufort Sea. This letter was issued under the authority of the Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) and 50 CFR part 228, subparts A and B.</textblock>
    <textblock>A letter was issued to Western Geophysical, 351 E. International Airport Road, Anchorage, Alaska 99518. The letter is valid only for activities conducted in 1994, and is subject to the provisions of the MMPA, regulations governing small takes of marine mammals incidental to specified activities, and regulations governing the taking of ringed seals incidental to on-ice seismic activities in the Beaufort Sea (50 CFR part 228, subparts A and B and 58 FR 4091, January 13, 1993).</textblock>
    <textblock>Issuances of letters are based on findings that the total takings will have a negligible impact on the ringed seal species or stock and will not have an unmitigable adverse impact on the availability of the species for subsistence uses.</textblock>
