    <textblock>(3) Subject to paragraphs (a)(2) of this section, the actual and estimated revenues referred to in paragraphs (j) (1) and (2) of this section shall be shown in total and separately for each class and subclass of mail and postal service and for all other sources of revenue. Revenues derived from classes and subclasses of mail shall be disaggregated to each unique rate element.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Each revenue presentation required by paragraph (j)(1), (j)(2), and (j)(3) of this section shall, subject to paragraph (a)(2) of this section, be documented in sufficient detail to allow independent replication. Revenue estimates shall be supported by exhibits or workpapers that reference the source of all data used, including volume levels, billing determinants, and adjustment factors. References may be to published documents, library references, or companion testimony, and shall include document identity, page, and line, as appropriate. All assumptions used to estimate revenue for new or redesigned rate elements shall be identified and explained.</textblock>

    <textblock>(6) The estimated volumes and revenues referred to in paragraphs (j)(2), (j)(3), and (j)(5) of this section shall be derived from the econometric demand study referred to in paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section. Supporting rationale shall be provided for any departure from the assumptions and specifications in the demand study made in estimating volumes of any class, subclass, or rate category of mail. Supporting rationale shall be provided for using billing determinants to estimate revenues for any class, subclass, or rate category of mail that differ from the billing determinants implicit in the estimate of volumes for that class, subclass, or rate category.</textblock>
