    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Chapter Nineteen of the North American Free Trade Agreement (``Agreement'') establishes a mechanism for replacing judicial review of final antidumping and countervailing duty determinations involving imports from Canada, Mexico, or the United States with review by independent binational panels. If requested, these panels will expeditiously review final determinations to determine whether they are consistent with the antidumping or countervailing duty law of the importing country.</textblock>
    <textblock>Title IV of the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1993, Public Law No. 103-182, 107 Stat. 2057, amends United States law to implement Chapter Nineteen of the Agreement.</textblock>
