    <textblock>(k) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price and the Class III price) by the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to §1135.43(d); and</textblock>
    <textblock>(l) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. Any applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products received at the plant during the prior month.</textblock>
    <textblock>13. Section 1135.61 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§1135.61</textblock>
    <textblock>Computation of weighted average differential price.</textblock>
    <textblock>A</textblock>
    <textblock>weighted average differential price</textblock>
    <textblock>for all milk received from producers shall be computed by the market administrator as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to §1135.60 (a) through (c) and (f) through (l) for all handlers who filed reports pursuant to §1135.30 for the month, and who made the payments pursuant to §1135.71 for the preceding month;</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the unobligated balance in the producer-settlement fund;</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Divide the resulting amount by the sum, for all handlers, of the total hundredweight of producer milk and the total hundredweight for which values were computed pursuant to §1135.60(j); and</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Subtract not less than 4 cents nor more than 5 cents per hundredweight of milk included under paragraph (c) of this section. The result shall be the weighted average differential price.</textblock>
    <textblock>§1135.62</textblock>
    <textblock>[Redesignated as §1135.63]</textblock>
    <textblock>14. Section 1135.62 is redesignated as §1135.63 and revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§1135.63</textblock>
    <textblock>Announcement of the weighted average differential price, the producer protein price, and an estimated uniform price.</textblock>
    <textblock>The market administrator shall announce on or before the 14th day after the end of each month the following prices for such month:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) The weighted average differential price;</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) The producer protein price; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(c)</textblock>
    <textblock>An estimated uniform price</textblock>
    <textblock>per hundredweight of milk computed by adding the weighted average differential price to the basic formula price.</textblock>
    <textblock>15. A new §1135.62 is added to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§1135.62</textblock>
    <textblock>Computation of producer protein price.</textblock>
    <textblock>A</textblock>
    <textblock>producer protein price</textblock>
    <textblock>shall be computed by the market administrator each month as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Combine into one total the values computed pursuant to §1135.60(d) and (e) for all handlers who filed reports pursuant to §1135.30 and who made payments pursuant to §1135.71 for the preceding month;</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Divide the resulting amount by the total pounds or protein contained in producer milk; and</textblock>
