    <textblock>The recent report by GAO on current financial aid programs does not indicate the existence of serious problems of noncompliance with the law in postsecondary institutions. That report found that race-targeted scholarships constitute a very small percentage of the scholarships awarded to students at postsecondary institutions. The Secretary anticipates that most existing programs will be able to satisfy the principles set out in this final guidance.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department will use the principles described in this final policy guidance in making determinations concerning discrimination based on race or national origin in the award of financial aid. These principles describe the circumstances in which the Department, based on its interpretation of Title VI and relevant case law, believes consideration of race or national origin in the award of financial aid to be permissible. A financial aid program that falls within one or more of these principles will be, in the Department's view, in compliance with Title VI.</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>This guidance is intended to assist colleges in fashioning legally defensible affirmative action programs to promote the access of minority students to postsecondary education. The Department will offer technical assistance to colleges in reexamining their financial aid programs based on this guidance.</textblock>
    <textblock>This notice consists of five simply stated principles and a section containing a legal analysis for each principle. The legal analysis addresses the major comments received in response to the notice of proposed policy guidance.</textblock>
    <textblock>Summary of Changes in the Final Policy Guidance</textblock>
    <textblock>Almost 600 written responses were received by the Department in response to the proposed policy guidance, many with detailed suggestions and analysis. Many additional suggestions and concerns were raised in meetings between Department officials and representatives of postsecondary institutions and civil rights groups. The vast majority of comments expressed support for the objective of clarifying the options colleges have to use financial aid to promote student diversity and access of minorities to postsecondary education without violating Title VI. Many comments, however, took issue with specific principles in the proposed policy guidance and questioned whether those principles would be effective in accomplishing this purpose.</textblock>
    <textblock>As more fully explained in the legal analysis section of this document, after reviewing the public comments and reexamining the legal precedents in light of those comments, the Department has revised the policy guidance in the following respects:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Principle 3_``Financial Aid to Remedy Past Discrimination''_has been amended to permit a college to award financial aid based on race or national origin as part of affirmative action to remedy the effects of its past discrimination without waiting for a finding to be made by the Office for Civil Rights (OCR), a court, or a legislative body, if the college has a strong basis in evidence of discrimination justifying the use of race-targeted scholarships.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Principle 4_``Financial Aid to Create Diversity''_has been amended to permit the award of financial aid on the basis of race or national origin if the aid is a necessary and narrowly tailored means to accomplish a college's goal to have a diverse student body that will enrich its academic environment.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Principle 5_``Private Gifts Restricted by Race or National Origin''_has been amended to clarify that a college can administer financial aid from private donors that is restricted on the basis of race or national origin only if that aid is consistent with the other principles in this policy guidance.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) A provision has been added to permit historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) to participate in race-targeted programs for black students established by third parties if the programs are not limited to students at HBCUs.</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Provisions in the proposed policy guidance for a transition period have been revised to provide that, as far as the Department's enforcement efforts are concerned_</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Colleges and other recipients of federal financial assistance will have a reasonable period of time_up to two years_to review their financial aid programs and to make any adjustments necessary to come into compliance with the principles in this final policy guidance;</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) No student who has received or applied for financial aid at the time this guidance becomes effective will lose aid as a result of this guidance. Thus, if an award of financial aid is inconsistent with the principles in this guidance, a college or other recipient of Federal financial assistance may continue to provide the aid to a student during the course of his or her enrollment in the academic program for which the aid was awarded, if the student had either applied for or received the aid prior to the effective date of this policy guidance.</textblock>
    <textblock>Principles</textblock>
    <textblock>Definitions</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of these principles_</textblock>
    <textblock>College</textblock>
    <textblock>means any postsecondary institution that receives federal financial assistance from the Department of Education.</textblock>
    <textblock>Financial aid</textblock>
    <textblock>includes scholarships, grants, loans, work-study, and fellowships that are made available to assist a student to pay for his or her education at a college.</textblock>
    <textblock>Race-neutral</textblock>
    <textblock>means not based, in whole or in part, on race or national origin.</textblock>
    <textblock>Race-targeted, race-based,</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>awarded on the basis of race or national origin</textblock>
    <textblock>mean limited to individuals of a particular race or races or national origin or origins.</textblock>
  </text>
  <footnote>
    <textblock>In identifying these principles, the Department is not foreclosing the possibility that there may be other bases on which a college may support its consideration of race or national origin in awarding financial aid. The Department will consider any justifications that are presented during the course of a Title VI investigation on a case-by-case basis.</textblock>
