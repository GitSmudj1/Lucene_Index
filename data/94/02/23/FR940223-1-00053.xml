    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>USEPA is proposing to approve a revision to the Minnesota State Implementation Plan (SIP) for new source review in nonattainment areas, submitted to meet longstanding requirements as well as new requirements imposed by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. This revision consists of the State Rules 7005.3010 through 7005.3060, which incorporate by reference the new source review requirements specified in appendix S to title 40 Code of Federal Regulations part 51 (40 CFR part 51), ``Emission Offset Interpretive Ruling,'' except for the deletion of unacceptable exemptions included in appendix S. Final approval of this revision would lift the current ban on permitting major sources and major modifications in Minnesota nonattainment areas.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Summary of State Submittal</textblock>
    <textblock>Part D of title I of the Clean Air Act sets forth SIP requirements for nonattainment areas. Section 173 and the various subparts of title I contain the program requirements for the review and issuance of permits for the construction of major new sources and major modifications in a nonattainment area. Currently, Minnesota has no approved nonattainment area permitting program. On August 5, 1992, and August 26, 1993, Minnesota submitted revised new source review regulations for the purpose of meeting these requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>The statutory requirements that apply to State regulations for new source review in nonattainment areas are set forth at part D of title I of the Clean Air Act, particularly in sections 172(c)(5) and 173. Federal regulations developed prior to enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 for nonattainment area new source review programs are set forth at title 40 Code of Federal Regulations part 51 (40 CFR part 51), particularly 40 CFR 51.165. The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 also establish assorted new requirements, for which preliminary guidance was published April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13498), and April 28, 1992 (57 FR 18070). For example, section 189(a)(1)(A) requires that sections 172(c)(5) and 173 be met for fine particulate matter nonattainment areas.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) has submitted general permitting regulations to USEPA on various occasions, including January 28, 1972; May 28, 1972; January 23, 1981; and January 7, 1985. USEPA approved the 1972 submittals on May 31, 1972; the 1981 submittal on May 6, 1982; and the 1985 submittal on May 13, 1988. However, these rules did not address the specific requirements for permitting new and modified major sources in nonattainment areas. Consequently, Minnesota has no approved nonattainment area permitting program, and the State continues to be subject to a prohibition against permitting major new sources and major modifications in the State's nonattainment areas, as promulgated by USEPA on July 2, 1979 (44 FR 38583). More recent MPCA submittals, which are the subjects of this proposed rulemaking, were intended to address the requirements for nonattainment area new source permitting and allow USEPA to lift the permitting prohibition.</textblock>
    <textblock>MPCA has submitted SIP revisions for meeting the permitting requirements of part D on two previous occasions. MPCA's first submittal was on December 22, 1981. USEPA proposed conditional approval of this rule in the July 29, 1982,</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(47 FR 32742). Minnesota used the plant-wide definition of source in its rule. Before final rulemaking could be published, the D.C. Circuit Court ruled against the plant-wide definition of source. This decision was later overturned (</textblock>
    <textblock>Chevron, U.S.A., Inc.</textblock>
    <textblock>v.</textblock>
    <textblock>NRDC</textblock>
    <textblock>, 104 S.Ct. 2778 (1984)), but USEPA never approved this SIP revision because of other concerns. This submittal was ultimately withdrawn, in an August 21, 1990, letter from the Commissioner of MPCA, and USEPA's proposed action on this submittal was withdrawn in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of November 7, 1990 (55 FR 46829).</textblock>
    <textblock>MPCA submitted its second revision for meeting the permitting requirements on March 13, 1989. In February 1990, USEPA provided MPCA with comments, stating that the rule would not be approved. In a February 24, 1992, letter, Charles W. Williams, Commissioner, MPCA, withdrew the March 13, 1989, submittal.</textblock>
    <textblock>The current revisions being addressed in this rulemaking include State submittals of August 5, 1992, and August 26, 1993. These submittals include State Rules 7005.3010 through 7005.3060 (``Offset Rule''). These rules incorporate appendix S to 40 CFR part 51 into these State rules, modified in response to recommendations by USEPA.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 173 of the Act identifies four essential requirements that State new source permit regulations must impose in nonattainment areas: (1) New source emissions must be offset by equivalent or greater emission reductions in the area, (2) the new source must have lowest achievable emission rates (LAER), (3) other sources owned by the owner or operator of the new source must be in compliance or on a schedule to achieve compliance with applicable regulations, and (4) the area must not be subject to a finding of failure to implement the SIP.</textblock>
    <textblock>Incorporation of Appendix S</textblock>
    <textblock>In general, adoption of appendix S of 40 CFR part 51 into the State's regulations serves to impose the requirements identified in section 173. Part IV. A. of appendix S provides multiple conditions for granting a permit, including a requirement for lowest achievable emission rates (requirement 2 above), a requirement for compliance of commonly owned sources (requirement 3 above), and a requirement for offsets (requirement 1 above). Although appendix S contains no provision prohibiting permits in ``failure to implement'' areas, USEPA has adequate authority under section 113(a)(5) to take any necessary action to address permits that violate this prohibition.</textblock>
