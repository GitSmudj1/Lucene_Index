    <textblock>(a) Each handler shall make payment pursuant to this paragraph or paragraph (b) of this section to each producer from whom milk is received during the month:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) On or before the last day of the month, to each producer who did not discontinue shipping milk to such handler before the 18th day of the month at not less than the Class III price</textblock>
    <textblock>for the preceding month per hundredweight of milk received from the producer during the first 15 days of the month, subject to adjustment for proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) On or before the 19th day after the end of each month, an amount computed as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Multiply the butterfat price for the month by the total pounds of butterfat in milk received from the producer;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Add the amount that results from multiplying the producer nonfat milk solids price for the month by the total pounds of nonfat milk solids in the milk received from the producer;</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Add the amount that results from multiplying the total hundredweight of milk received from the producer by the weighted average differential price for the month as adjusted pursuant to §1124.74(a);</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) Subtract payments made to the producer pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section;</textblock>
    <textblock>(v) Subtract proper deductions authorized in writing by the producer; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(vi) Subtract any deduction required pursuant to statute; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) If by the 19th day after the end of the month, a handler has not received full payment from the market administrator pursuant to §1124.72, the payments to producers required pursuant to paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be reduced uniformly as a percentage of the amount due each producer by a total sum not in excess of the remainder due from the market administrator. The handler shall pay the balance due producers on or before the date for making payments pursuant to such paragraph next following receipt of the full payment from the market administrator.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) The payments required in paragraph (a) of this section shall, upon the request of a cooperative association qualified under §1124.18, be made to the association or its duly authorized agent for milk received from each producer who has given such association authorization by contract or other written instrument to collect the proceeds from the sale of the producer's milk. All payments required pursuant to this paragraph shall be made on or before the second day prior to the dates specified for such payment in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Each handler shall pay to each cooperative association which operates a pool plant, or the cooperative's duly authorized agent, for butterfat and nonfat milk solids received from such plant in the form of fluid milk products as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) On or before the second day prior to the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for butterfat and nonfat milk solids received during the first 15 days of the month at not less than the butterfat and nonfat milk solids prices, respectively, for the preceding month; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) On or before the 15th day after the end of the month, an amount of money determined in accordance with computations made on the same basis as those specified in paragraph (a)(2) (i) through (iii) of this section, minus any payment made pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Each handler pursuant to §1124.9(a) that received milk from a cooperative association that was a handler pursuant to</textblock>
    <textblock>§1124.9(c) shall pay the cooperative association for such milk as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) On or before the second day prior to the date specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, for milk received during the first 15 days of the month at not less than the Class III price for the preceding month; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) On or before the 17th day after the end of each month, for milk received during the month an amount of money determined in accordance with the computations specified in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through (iii) of this section, minus any payment made pursuant to paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e) None of the provisions of this section shall be construed to restrict any cooperative association qualified under section 8c(5)(F) of the Act from making payment for milk to its producers in accordance with such provision of the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>(f) In making payments to producers pursuant to this section, each handler shall provide each producer, on or before the 19th day of each month, with a supporting statement for milk received from the producer during the previous month in such form that it may be retained by the producer, which shall show:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The identity of the handler and the producer;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The total pounds of milk delivered by the producer, the pounds of butterfat and nonfat milk solids contained therein, and, unless previously provided, the pounds of milk in each delivery;</textblock>
