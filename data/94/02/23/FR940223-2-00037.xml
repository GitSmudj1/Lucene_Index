    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Since its inception in 1989, approximately $30 million has been awarded to over 100 State, Tribal, and regional organizations under EPA's multimedia pollution prevention grant program.</textblock>
    <textblock>In November 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (the Act) (Pub. L. 101-508) was enacted, establishing as national policy that pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible. Section 6603 of the Act defines source reduction as any practice that:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants, or contaminants.</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA further defines pollution prevention as the use of other practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants through: increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water or other resources, or protection of natural resources by conservation.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 6605 of the Act authorizes EPA to make matching grants to States to promote the use of source reduction techniques by businesses. In evaluating grant applications, the Act directs EPA to consider whether the proposed State programs will:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Make technical assistance available to businesses seeking information about source reduction opportunities, including funding for experts to provide on-site technical advice and to assist in the development of source reduction plans.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Target assistance to businesses for whom lack of information is an impediment to source reduction.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Provide training in source reduction techniques.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition to this grant making authority, the Act authorizes EPA to establish a national source reduction clearinghouse, expands EPA's authority to collect data to better track source reduction activities, and requires EPA to report periodically to Congress on EPA's progress in implementing the Act.</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Availability of FY 94 Funds</textblock>
    <textblock>With this publication, EPA is announcing the availability of approximately $6 million in grant/cooperative agreement funds for FY 1994. The Agency has delegated grant authority to the EPA Regional offices which formally transfers the decisionmaking and awarding process for the PPIS grants to the Regions. Regional offices now assume responsibility for the solicitation of interest, screening of proposals, and the actual selection of awards. This sixth round of awards represents a more direct and active Regional role in determining FY '94 awardees. PPIS grant guidance will be developed separately by each Regional program and will be provided to all applicants along with any supplemental information the Regions may wish to provide. Interested applicants should contact their Regional Pollution Prevention Coordinator for more information.</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Eligibility</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with the Act, eligible applicants for purposes of funding under this grant program include the 50 States, the District of Columbia, the U.S. Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, any territory or possession of the United States, any agency or instrumentality of a State including State universities and all Federally-recognized Indian tribes. For convenience, the term ``State'' in this notice refers to all eligible applicants. Local governments, private universities, private non-profit entities, private businesses, and individuals are not eligible. These organizations excluded from applying directly are encouraged to work with eligible applicants in developing proposals that include them as participants in the projects. EPA strongly encourages this type of cooperative arrangement.</textblock>
    <textblock>1.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance.</textblock>
    <textblock>The number assigned to the PPIS program is 66.900. Organizations receiving pollution prevention grant funds are required to match Federal funds by at least 50 percent. For example, the Federal government will provide half of the total allowable cost of the project, the State half of the total allowable cost of the project. A grant request for $100,000 would support a total allowable project cost of $200,000, with the State also providing $100,000. State contributions may include dollars, in-kind goods and services and/or third party contributions.</textblock>
    <textblock>2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Eligible activities</textblock>
    <textblock>. In general, the purpose of the PPIS grant program is to support the establishment and expansion of State-, Regional-, Tribal-, or local-based multimedia pollution prevention programs. EPA specifically seeks to build State pollution prevention capabilities or to test, at the State level, innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies. Funds awarded under the PPIS grant program must be used to support pollution prevention programs that address the transfer of potentially harmful pollutants across all environmental media: Air, water, and land. Programs should reflect comprehensive and coordinated pollution prevention planning and implementation efforts State- or Region-wide and where approporiate, seek to address State environmental equity issues. States might focus on, for example:</textblock>
    <textblock>a. Developing other multi-media pollution prevention activities, including but not limited to: Providing direct technical assistance to businesses; collecting and analyzing data to target outreach and technical assistance opportunities; conducting outreach activities; developing measures to determine progress in pollution prevention; and identifying regulatory and non-regulatory barriers and incentives to pollution prevention and developing plans to implement solutions, where possible.</textblock>
    <textblock>b. Institutionalizing multi-media pollution prevention as an environmental management priority, establishing prevention goals, developing strategies to meet those goals, and integrating the pollution prevention ethic within both governmental and non-governmental institutions of the State or region.</textblock>
    <textblock>c. Initiating demonstration projects that test and support innovative pollution prevention approaches and methodologies.</textblock>
    <textblock>Proposals accepted for review under this program must qualify as pollution prevention as defined by section 6603 of the Act. In May of 1992, EPA released a ``Statement of Definition'' as the formal embodiment of the Agency's working definition of pollution prevention, consistent with the Act. (See ``EPA Statement of Definition'' under unit VI of this notice.)</textblock>

    <textblock>V. Media State Grants</textblock>
    <textblock>Though the PPIS grant program is an instrumental component for building and maintaining State pollution prevention programs, EPA is seeking to further integrate pollution prevention into the Agency's existing media-specific grant programs. To this end, States are encouraged to access, where appropriate, media grant dollars to support state pollution prevention activities. This new Agency policy provides State programs with the opportunity to utilize grant funds, traditionally targeted for end-of-pipe activities, to support source reduction efforts. In November of 1992, in support of the Act and to further integrate pollution prevention into the Agency's existing regulatory programs, EPA released a Guidance for the Integration of Pollution Prevention into Media State Grants. The Agency-wide pollution prevention Guidance, beginning with the FY 1994 State grants cycle has four goals:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Promoting pollution prevention in State programs supported through Federal grants by establishing national principles to guide workplans negotiated between Regional Offices and States.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Ensuring that grant requirements as interpreted by EPA/State workplans are flexible enough to support innovative State pollution prevention activities.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Establishing a simple accounting process to share information on successful State projects, and identify statutory or other barriers to funding State proposals.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Building sustained State capacity in pollution prevention to the extent consistent with statutory grant requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>The new Guidance is designed to help integrate pollution prevention into the Agency's activities as required by the Act. In other words, it will now be possible, as a result of this guidance to use these traditional media State grants to support pollution prevention purposes. By emphasizing flexibility, the Guidance complements other Agency efforts to build a productive environmental management system in partnership with the States, and improve coordination with existing State pollution prevention programs.</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA's FY 1994 grant programs, in conjunction with the States, should build on the Agency's many successful pollution prevention efforts to explicitly promote pollution prevention in State workplans (also called agreements). This Guidance will be incorporated into the annual Agency Operating Guidance as well as program-specific Guidance developed in conjunction with the State/EPA Operations Committee. Program Guidance, intended to tailor the Agency-wide commitment to each grant program, will be applied by EPA Regional offices and States in the development of grant-assisted work. In general, the Guidance applies to all of the Agency's media-specific State grant programs.</textblock>
    <textblock>For further information, or for a copy of the Guidance, contact Tom McCully, Acting Director, Pollution Prevention Policy Staff in the Office of the Administrator, at (202) 260-8621, or Lena Hann, Pollution Prevention Division, at (202) 260-2237.</textblock>
    <textblock>VI. Definition of Pollution Prevention</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA's ``Statement of Definition'' as defined in May of 1992 follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>The following EPA ``Statement of Definition'' is a formal embodiment of what has been the Agency's working definition of pollution prevention, and is consistent with the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990. It makes clear that prevention is our first priority within an environmental management hierarchy that includes: 1) prevention, 2) recycling, 3) treatment, and 4) disposal or release.</textblock>
    <textblock>While it is subject to further refinement, this definition should provide a common reference point for all of us. As you review and apply the definition in your work, please keep the following points in mind:</textblock>
    <textblock>• As always, whether the pollution prevention option is selected in any given situation will depend on the requirements of applicable law, the level of risk reduction that can be achieved, and the cost-effectiveness of that option.</textblock>
    <textblock>•Accordingly, the hierarchy should be viewed as establishing a set of preferences, rather than an absolute judgment that prevention is always the most desirable option. The hierarchy is applied to many different kinds of circumstances that will require judgment calls.</textblock>
    <textblock>•Drawing an absolute line between prevention and recycling can be difficult. ``Prevention'' includes what is commonly called ``in-process recycling,'' but not ``out-of-process recycling.'' Recycling conducted in an environmentally sound manner shares many of the advantages of prevention, e.g. energy and resource conservation, and reducing the need for end-of-pipe treatment or waste containment.</textblock>
    <textblock>As EPA looks at the ``big picture'' in setting strategic directions for the decade ahead, it is clear that prevention is key to solving the problems that all our media programs face, including the increasing cost of treatment and cleanup. In the common-sense words of Benjamin Franklin, ``an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.''</textblock>
    <textblock>Please keep EPA's definition of pollution prevention in mind as you perform your environmental work.</textblock>
    <textblock>POLLUTION PREVENTION: EPA STATEMENT OF DEFINITION</textblock>
    <textblock>(pursuant to the Pollution Prevention Act)</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990, Congress established a national policy that:</textblock>
    <textblock>• pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible;</textblock>
    <textblock>• pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible;</textblock>
    <textblock>• pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible; and</textblock>
    <textblock>• disposal or other release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pollution prevention means ``source reduction'', as defined under the Pollution Prevention Act, and other practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants through:</textblock>
    <textblock>- increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water or other resources, or</textblock>
    <textblock>- protection of natural resources by conservation.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Pollution Prevention Act defines ``source reduction'' to mean any practice which:</textblock>
    <textblock>- reduces the amount of any hazardous substance, pollutant or contaminant entering any waste stream or otherwise released into the environment (including fugitive emissions) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal; and</textblock>
    <textblock>- reduces the hazards to public health and the environment associated with the release of such substances, pollutants or contaminants.</textblock>
    <textblock>The term includes: equipment or technology modifications, process or procedure modifications, reformulation or redesign of products, substitution of raw materials, and improvements in housekeeping, maintenance, training, or inventory control.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the Pollution Prevention Act, recycling, energy recovery, treatment, and disposal are not included within the definition of pollution prevention. Some practices commonly described as ``in process recycling'' may qualify as pollution prevention. Recycling that is conducted in an environmentally sound manner shares many of the advantages of prevention _ it can reduce the need for treatment or disposal, and conserve energy and resources.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pollution prevention approaches can be applied to all pollution-generating activity: including energy, agriculture, Federal, consumer as well as industrial sectors. The impairment of wetlands, ground water sources, and other critical resources constitutes pollution, and prevention practices may be essential for preserving these resources. These practices may include conservation techniques and changes in management practices to prevent harm to sensitive ecosystems. Pollution prevention does not include practices that create new risks of concern.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the agricultural sector, pollution prevention approaches include:</textblock>
    <textblock>- reducing the use of water and chemical inputs;</textblock>
    <textblock>- adoption of less environmentally harmful pesticides or cultivation of crop strains with natural resistance to pests; and</textblock>
    <textblock>- protection of sensitive areas.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the energy sector, pollution prevention can reduce environmental damages from extraction, processing, transport and combustion of fuels. Pollution prevention approaches include:</textblock>
    <textblock>- increasing efficiency in energy use;</textblock>
    <textblock>- substituting environmentally benign fuel sources; and</textblock>
    <textblock>- design changes that reduce the demand for energy.</textblock>
