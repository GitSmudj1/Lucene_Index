    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule would amend the General Services Administration Acquisition Regulation (GSAR) to prescribe a Price Reductions clause for use in multiple award schedule (MAS) solicitations and contracts. The clause is a modification of that currently in use. The modifications clarify the clause's applicability, reduce contractor reporting requirements and eliminate MAS price reductions based on a low price to an individual Federal agency.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>On June 14, 1993, GSA solicited comments (58 FR 32890) on proposed changes to the current MAS Price Reductions clause. The proposed clause would have eliminated certain reporting requirements and increased the time given contractors to notify the Government of price reductions. Public comments received generally supported the changes, but felt that further changes should be made to reduce the burden on MAS contractors. To address these comments GSA proposes to further revise the clause to require that the Government be extended price reductions under the same terms and with the same effective dates which the contractor extends to commercial customers.</textblock>
    <textblock>The National Performance Review recommended that line managers be given greater flexibility to buy the same or comparable MAS products for less. In order to remove any disincentive to MAS contractors offering agencies a lower price on individual orders, GSA proposes to eliminate paragraph (c) of the current clause entitled ``Price Reductions to Federal Agencies.''</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Executive Order 12866</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule was submitted to and approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in accordance with Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review.</textblock>
    <textblock>C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>An initial regulatory flexibility analysis has been prepared and submitted to the Acting Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration. Copies of the initial regulatory flexibility analysis are available from the office identified above. The initial regulatory flexibility analysis indicates that the proposed rule will affect contractors, including small businesses, that are awarded contracts under GSA's MAS program. Historically, approximately seventy percent of MAS contractors have been small businesses. Based on the number of MAS contracts currently in effect, it is estimated that 4,288 small businesses will be impacted by the new rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>D. Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The Price Reductions clause is an information collection subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>
    <textblock>, and has been submitted to OMB for approval under the Act. Comments on the information collection requirements may be submitted to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs of OMB, Attention: Desk Officer for GSA, Washington, DC 20503. The title of the information collection is ``GSAR 552.238-75 Price Reductions.''</textblock>
    <textblock>The Price Reductions clause is intended to ensure that the Government maintains its price/discount (and/or term and condition) advantage in relation to the contractor's commercial customer(s) upon which the MAS contract is predicated. The customer or category of customer upon which the award is predicated is identified at the conclusion negotiations and reflected in the MAS contract.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Price Reductions clause requires MAS contractors to notify the contracting officer of price reductions at the same time that commercial customers are notified.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Price Reductions clause is needed to assure that the Government maintains the relative discount position, negotiated at the time of contract award, throughout the term of the contract.</textblock>
    <textblock>The estimated annual burden for the Price Reductions clauses is 24,508 hours. This is based upon an estimated average burden per response of 2 hours, a frequency of 2 responses per respondent, and an estimated number of likely respondents of 6,127.</textblock>

    <textblock>Accordingly, it is proposed that 48 CFR parts 538 and 552 be amended as follows:</textblock>
