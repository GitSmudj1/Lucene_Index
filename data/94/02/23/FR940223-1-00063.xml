    <textblock>(2) Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President's priorities, or the principles set forth in the Executive Order.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to the terms of Executive Order 12866, it has been determined that this rule is a ``significant regulatory action'' because it raises novel policy issues in terms of defining when products used in a manner constituting disposal should be regulated. As such, this action was submitted to OMB for review. Changes made in response to OMB suggestions or recommendations will be documented in the public record.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>Under the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq., whenever an Agency is required to issue a general notice of rulemaking for any proposed or final rule, it must prepare and make available for public comment a regulatory flexibility analysis that describes the impact of the rule on small entities (</textblock>
    <textblock>i.e.</textblock>
    <textblock>, small businesses, small organizations, and small governmental jurisdictions). No regulatory flexibility analysis is required, however, if the head of the Agency certifies that the rule will not have any impact on any small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>This amendment will not have any impact on any small entities, since the regulated community will continue to have other readily available options for using and managing HTMR slags. Therefore, pursuant to section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Administrator certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This regulation, therefore, does not require a regulatory flexibility analysis.</textblock>
    <textblock>C. Paperwork Reduction Act</textblock>
    <textblock>The Agency has determined that there are no additional reporting, notification, or recordkeeping provisions associated with this proposed rule. Such provisions, were they included,</textblock>
    <textblock>would be submitted for approval to OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501</textblock>
    <textblock>et seq.</textblock>

    <textblock>For the reasons set out in the preamble, 40 CFR part 266 is proposed to be amended as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 266_STANDARDS FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC HAZARDOUS WASTES AND SPECIFIC TYPES OF HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT FACILITIES</textblock>
    <textblock>1. The authority citation for part 266 continues to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>42 U.S.C. 6905, 6912(a), 6924, and 6934.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subpart C_Recyclable Materials Used in a Manner Constituting Disposal</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Section 266.20 is amended by adding a new paragraph (c) to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง266.20</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicability.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Non-encapsulated uses of slags, which are generated from high temperature metals recovery (HTMR) processing of hazardous waste K061, K062, and F006, in a manner constituting disposal are not covered by the exemption in paragraph (b) of this section and remain subject to regulation. Non-encapsulated uses are those uses in which the HTMR slag is not contained, controlled, covered, or capped in a manner that eliminates or significantly reduces its mobility and potential for release into the environment (e.g., uses as anti-skid or deicing materials).</textblock>
