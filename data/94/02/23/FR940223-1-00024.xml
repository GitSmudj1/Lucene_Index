    <textblock>(6) Subtract the Class III value of the milk at the previous month's nonfat milk solids and butterfat prices;</textblock>
    <textblock>(h) Multiply the difference between the Class I price, adjusted for the location of the pool plant, and the Class III price by the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat assigned to Class I pursuant to §1124.43(f) and subtracted from Class I pursuant to §1124.44(a)(8) (i) through (iv), (vii), and §1124.44(b), excluding:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Receipts of bulk fluid cream products from an other order plant;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Receipts of bulk concentrated fluid milk products from pool plants, other order plants, and unregulated supply plants; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Receipts of nonfluid milk products that are distributed as labeled reconstituted milk for which payments are made to the producer-settlement fund of another order under §1124.75 (b)(4) or (c);</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Multiply the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat subtracted from Class I pursuant to §1124.44(a)(8) (v) and (vi) and §1124.44(b) by the difference between the Class I price at the transferor plant and the Class III price;</textblock>
    <textblock>(j) Multiply the difference between the Class I and Class III prices, applicable at the location of the nearest nonpool plant(s) from which an equivalent volume was received, with respect to skim milk and butterfat in receipts of concentrated fluid milk products assigned to Class I pursuant to §1124.43(f) and §1124.44(a)(8)(v) and the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat in receipts from an unregulated supply plant assigned pursuant to §1124.44 (a)(12) and (b), excluding such skim milk or butterfat in receipts of bulk fluid milk products from an unregulated supply plant to the extent that an equivalent quantity disposed of to such plant by handlers fully regulated by any Federal order is classified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any other payment obligation under any order;</textblock>
    <textblock>(k) Subtract, for reconstituted milk made from receipts of nonfluid milk products, an amount computed by multiplying $1.00 (but not more than the difference between the Class I price applicable at the location of the pool plant and the Class III price) by the combined pounds of skim milk and butterfat contained in receipts of nonfluid milk products that are allocated to Class I use pursuant to §1124.43(f);</textblock>
    <textblock>(l) Add or subtract, as appropriate, the amount necessary to correct errors disclosed by the verification of the handler's receipts and utilization of skim milk and butterfat as reported for previous months; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(m) For pool plants that transfer bulk concentrated fluid milk products to other pool plants and other order plants, add or subtract the amount per hundredweight of any class price change from the previous month that results from any inventory reclassification of bulk concentrated fluid milk products that occurs at the transferee plant. Any applicable class price change shall be applied to the plant that used the concentrated milk in the event that the concentrated fluid milk products were made from bulk unconcentrated fluid milk products received at the plant during the prior month.</textblock>
    <textblock>17. Section 1124.61 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§1124.61</textblock>
    <textblock>Computation of weighted average differential price.</textblock>
    <textblock>A</textblock>
    <textblock>weighted average differential price</textblock>
    <textblock>for each month shall be computed by the market administrator as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Combine into one total the value computed pursuant to §1124.60 (a) through (c) and (f) through (m) for all handlers who filed the reports prescribed by §1124.30 for the month and who made the payments pursuant to §1124.71 for the preceding month;</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Add an amount equal to the total value of the location</textblock>
    <textblock>adjustments computed pursuant to §1124.74;</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Add an amount equal to not less than one-half of the</textblock>
    <textblock>unobligated balance in the producer settlement fund;</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Divide the resulting amount by the sum, for all handlers, of the total hundredweight of producer milk and the total hundredweight for which a value is computed pursuant to</textblock>
    <textblock>§1124.60(j); and</textblock>
