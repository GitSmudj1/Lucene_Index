    <textblock>5. Funding</textblock>
    <textblock>5.1␣Direct Funding from DOT</textblock>
    <textblock>Funds appropriated to DOT agencies will be available to partially finance initial national and</textblock>
    <textblock>community service projects in some of the five DOT programs in fiscal year 1994 (see</textblock>
    <textblock>individual discussions on funding in the individual DOT Program descriptions set forth in</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 2). These funds also may be allocated to finance portions of projects involving activities</textblock>
    <textblock>in more than one program area.</textblock>
    <textblock>Appropriations for fiscal year 1995, which begins October 1, 1994, are not expected to be</textblock>
    <textblock>enacted until September 1994, and it is not possible to verify the availability of follow-on</textblock>
    <textblock>funding at this time. However, it is anticipated that direct funding of all DOT national and</textblock>
    <textblock>community service Programs identified in this RFP may be available from DOT in future years.</textblock>
    <textblock>Depending on the nature of the proposal and the DOT Program to be implemented, it may be</textblock>
    <textblock>necessary for DOT funding to be given to State or local agencies, which will in turn pass the</textblock>
    <textblock>funding through to the service organization implementing the projects. DOT officials will advise</textblock>
    <textblock>and assist a service organization in arranging such coordination if its proposal is selected, and</textblock>
    <textblock>this coordination should not be viewed as an obstacle to the submission of an application at this</textblock>
    <textblock>time.</textblock>
    <textblock>Other restrictions on the use of Federal funds are discussed in Section 5.4 below.</textblock>
    <textblock>5.2␣National Service Corporation Funding</textblock>
    <textblock>DOT will submit a multi-program application containing all of the selected proposals and related</textblock>
    <textblock>partnership agreements to the National Service Corporation in order to request funding for the</textblock>
    <textblock>remaining program costs that cannot be covered by direct funding from DOT and matching funds</textblock>
    <textblock>from the service organization. Any funding provided by the National Service Corporation will</textblock>
    <textblock>come from the funds earmarked for Federal agencies. Since there is no guarantee that DOT will</textblock>
    <textblock>receive funding from the National Service Corporation, a proposal accepted by DOT ultimately</textblock>
    <textblock>may not be fully funded or funded at all if DOT's request for funding from the National Service</textblock>
    <textblock>Corporation is not granted.</textblock>
    <textblock>5.3␣Matching Funds</textblock>
    <textblock>Each selected applicant must provide matching funds equal to at least 25% of the cost of the</textblock>
    <textblock>program. Where authorized, other federal, state or local sources (not including funds provided</textblock>
    <textblock>directly by DOT or the National Service Corporation) may be counted as matching funds. In-kind contributions, including facilities, equipment, goods or services, may also be counted as</textblock>
    <textblock>matching funds. (In-kind contributions to be used as a match in more that one program must</textblock>
    <textblock>be divided between the programs in proportion to use.) Note that a preference will be given to</textblock>
    <textblock>proposals that provide the match through non-federal sources and matches that exceed the</textblock>
    <textblock>minimum match requirement.</textblock>
    <textblock>5.4␣Restrictions on Use of Federal and Corporation Funds</textblock>
    <textblock>a. Restrictions on Benefits</textblock>
    <textblock>No more than 85% of the living stipend for participants may be paid from federal sources</textblock>
    <textblock>(including funds received from the National Service Corporation and any other federal funds</textblock>
    <textblock>received, including DOT funds). No more than 85% of the costs of the most affordable health</textblock>
    <textblock>care policy that provides minimum benefits may be paid from with National Service Corporation</textblock>
    <textblock>funds. Payment of the 15% of the living stipend from non-federal sources and 15% of health</textblock>
    <textblock>care benefits from non-Corporation sources will be included as part of the overall match for the</textblock>
    <textblock>program.</textblock>
    <textblock>b. Restrictions on Administrative Costs</textblock>
    <textblock>Not more than 5% of the National Service Corporation funds may be used to pay for</textblock>
    <textblock>administrative costs. Administrative costs are costs associated with the overall administration</textblock>
    <textblock>of the program. Such costs include the following: (1) Indirect costs (i.e., costs identified with</textblock>
    <textblock>two or more cost objectives but not identified with a particular cost objective) as described in</textblock>
    <textblock>applicable provisions of Office of Management and Budget Circulars that relate to indirect costs;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) costs for financial, accounting, or contracting functions; (3) costs for insurance that protects</textblock>
    <textblock>the entity that operates the program; and (4) costs related to the evaluation of the program; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) costs for salaries and benefits of staff who recruit, train, place, or supervise participants.</textblock>
    <textblock>Particular costs such as those associated with staff who perform both administrative and program</textblock>
    <textblock>functions may be prorated between administrative costs and costs directly related to program</textblock>
    <textblock>operations.</textblock>
    <textblock>c. Restrictions on Equipment Purchases.</textblock>
    <textblock>Not more than 10% of National Service Corporation funds may be used to purchase equipment</textblock>
    <textblock>to be used for programmatic operation.</textblock>
    <textblock>d. Compliance with OMB Circulars</textblock>
    <textblock>Programs must comply with all applicable Office of Management and Budget circulars for grant</textblock>
    <textblock>management, including Circulars A-133, A-128 and A-110, and with all applicable Federal,</textblock>
    <textblock>State and local laws.</textblock>
