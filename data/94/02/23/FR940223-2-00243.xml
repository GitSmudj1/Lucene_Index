    <textblock>_Describe the key elements of the participant training, in-service</textblock>
    <textblock>education, or service-learning curriculum employed to improve</textblock>
    <textblock>participants' skills, prepare them for placement, and foster positive civic</textblock>
    <textblock>values, and promote an ongoing interest in community service. (Note</textblock>
    <textblock>that the program must, in a non-partisan manner, encourage participants</textblock>
    <textblock>to vote.)</textblock>
    <textblock>(v) Participant placement and supervision.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Explain how participants will be placed (in teams or individually) and</textblock>
    <textblock>matched with assignments.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Describe how service sponsors or host-sites will be oriented and</textblock>
    <textblock>prepared for that placement.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Explain how participants will be supervised.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Outline the standards of conduct for participants (all community and</textblock>
    <textblock>national service programs will be required to establish a standard of</textblock>
    <textblock>conduct to be stringently enforced.)</textblock>
    <textblock>(vi) Nondisplacement.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Explain what steps have been taken to ensure that no displacement or</textblock>
    <textblock>supplantation of other employees will occur as a result of the project, or</textblock>
    <textblock>the project will not result in other employees not being hired or not</textblock>
    <textblock>receiving promotions. Include a summary of any discussions or contacts</textblock>
    <textblock>with labor organizations in related fields of work. The written</textblock>
    <textblock>concurrence of any local labor organization representing employees</textblock>
    <textblock>engaged in the same or substantially similar work must be obtained.</textblock>
    <textblock>d. Participant profile, recruitment strategy, and benefits.</textblock>
    <textblock>Provide a description of the total number (full- or part-time) of participants to be recruited in the program, including the expected characteristics, attributes or skills of participants. Describe the benefits these participants will receive.</textblock>
    <textblock>(i)</textblock>
    <textblock>Number and characteristics of participants.</textblock>
    <textblock>_State the expected number and characteristics of participants, including racial or ethnic background, socio-economic status, gender, and educational attainment.</textblock>
    <textblock>_If the program will recruit fewer than 20 participants, please explain why this smaller number is appropriate to the purpose and design of the program.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Participant recruitment.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Explain the methods that will be used or the strategies undertaken to</textblock>
    <textblock>recruit participants.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Explain what measures will be taken to recruit diverse participants based</textblock>
    <textblock>on economic background, race, ethnicity, age, gender, marital status,</textblock>
    <textblock>education levels, and disabilities.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Participant selection.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Explain the methods or strategy that you will use to select participants.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Describe selection criteria, including minimum qualifications for</textblock>
    <textblock>participants.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Identify any specialized skills that participants will be required to possess</textblock>
    <textblock>in order to carry out service assignments.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) Participant benefits.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Identify the benefits that the participants will receive. (Note that all</textblock>
    <textblock>participants must receive health benefits and, if needed, child care.)</textblock>
    <textblock>_Describe the amount of the living allowance provided to each participant.</textblock>
    <textblock>(Note that the living allowance must be at least $7,440 for fiscal year</textblock>
    <textblock>1994 for full-time participants and must be at least $3,960 for each part-time participant, and cannot exceed twice these amounts.)</textblock>
    <textblock>_Describe the amount of the educational awards to be provided to each</textblock>
    <textblock>participant. (Note that proposals should provide for participants to</textblock>
    <textblock>receive educational awards (either from the National Service Corporation</textblock>
    <textblock>or from some other source) in an amount of $4,725 for one full-time</textblock>
    <textblock>term of service or $2,360 for one part-time term of service, for up to</textblock>
    <textblock>two terms of service.)</textblock>
    <textblock>_Describe how national service educational awards will be apportioned</textblock>
    <textblock>among program participants if not provided to all participants. (In</textblock>
    <textblock>general, the distribution should treat equally all participants doing the</textblock>
    <textblock>same or essentially similar work. Distribution based solely on economic</textblock>
    <textblock>needs of participants is not encouraged.)</textblock>
    <textblock>_Describe any alternative post-service benefits that might be used (e.g.,</textblock>
    <textblock>tuition credits at an institution of higher education or transition</textblock>
    <textblock>assistance).</textblock>
    <textblock>(v) Participant welfare.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Describe what measures will be taken to ensure the safety and well-being</textblock>
    <textblock>of participants while working on service projects.</textblock>

    <textblock>(Note that monitoring approaches such as community advisory councils,</textblock>
    <textblock>participant advisory councils, peer reviews, quality control inspections,</textblock>
    <textblock>and customer participant surveys are encouraged).</textblock>
    <textblock>_Explain how you will assess, on an ongoing basis, the quality of services</textblock>
    <textblock>and the satisfaction of both the participants and the individuals or</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions served.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Explain how you will collect required descriptive and demographic data</textblock>
    <textblock>(e.g., reporting requirements will include data regarding the</textblock>
    <textblock>characteristics of participants and data regarding services to be conducted</textblock>
    <textblock>in areas of economic or environmental distress.)</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Previous evaluations.</textblock>
    <textblock>_If your proposal is to replicate an existing program in other areas, state</textblock>
    <textblock>whether the original program has been evaluated.</textblock>
    <textblock>_Explain who conducted the evaluation and describe the results of the</textblock>
    <textblock>evaluation regarding community and participant impact.</textblock>
    <textblock>_If the original program has not been evaluated, explain what evidence</textblock>
    <textblock>exists of successful performance or of a track record to demonstrate its</textblock>
    <textblock>appropriateness for replication or expansion.</textblock>
    <textblock>f. Institutional and personnel information.</textblock>
    <textblock>Provide a description of the</textblock>
    <textblock>administering organization's past experience and institutional capacity to operate</textblock>
    <textblock>or coordinate a program comparable to the program(s) proposed, including the</textblock>
