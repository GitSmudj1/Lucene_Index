    <textblock>Pursuant to the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), the Department of Justice, United States Marshals Service, proposes to establish a new Privacy Act system of records entitled ``U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) Key Control Record System, JUSTICE/USM-016.''</textblock>
    <textblock>Title 5 U.S.C. 552a(e) (4) and (11) provide that the public be given a 30-day period in which to comment on any new routine uses of a system of records. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which has oversight responsibilities under the Act, requires a 40-day period in which to conclude its review of the system.</textblock>
    <textblock>Therefore, please submit any comments by March 25, 1994. The public, OMB, and the Congress are invited to submit written comments to Patricia E. Neely, Staff Assistant, Systems Policy Staff, Information Resources Management, Justice Management Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530 (Room 850, WCTR Building).</textblock>
    <textblock>In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 552a(r), the Department has provided a report on this system to OMB and the Congress.</textblock>
