    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of Energy (DOE), Chicago Field Office, through the Dallas Support Office, announces, pursuant to the DOE Financial Assistance Rules 10 CFR 600.14(f), that DOE intends to award a grant to the Texas Engineering Experiment Station at Prairie View A&amp;M University (PVAM), for the implementation of a collaborative program with the Energy Analysis and Diagnostic Center (EADC) at Texas A&amp;M University to provide the necessary training and support for development of an EADC at PVAM.</textblock>
  </summary>
  <supplem>
    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>DOE announces further that pursuant to 10 CFR 600.6(a)(2), this discretionary financial assistance award to the Texas Engineering Experiment Station at PVAM, would be based on the acceptance of an unsolicited application meeting the criteria of 10 CFR 600.14(e)(1). There are currently no Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) participating in the EADC program. Texas A&amp;M University (TAMU) is one of only six EADC program participants that have IAC qualifications to conduct the combined industrial assessment activities of energy efficiency improvement, waste reduction/pollution prevention and productivity improvement. Of the six IACs, TAMU is the only institution in close proximity to an Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) accredited HBCU. The proposed project is deemed meritorious based on the general evaluation in accordance with DOE 600.14(d) and represents a unique approach that would not be eligible for financial assistance under a recent, current, or planned solicitation.</textblock>
    <textblock>The project period for the grant award is 12 months. DOE plans to provide funding in the amount of $62,000.00.</textblock>
