    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>General requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Each refiner or</textblock>
    <textblock>importer is required to have its individual baseline</textblock>
    <textblock>determination methodology, resulting baseline fuel</textblock>
    <textblock>parameter, volume and emissions values, and 1990-1993</textblock>
    <textblock>blendstock-to-gasoline ratios (per ยง80.102) verified by an</textblock>
    <textblock>auditor which meets the requirements described in this</textblock>
    <textblock>section. A refiner or importer which has the anti-dumping</textblock>
    <textblock>statutory baseline as its individual baseline is exempt from</textblock>
    <textblock>this requirement.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) An auditor may be an individual or organization,</textblock>
    <textblock>and may utilize contractors and subcontractors to assist in</textblock>
    <textblock>the verification of a baseline.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) If an auditor is an organization, one or more</textblock>
    <textblock>persons shall be designated as primary analyst(s). The</textblock>
    <textblock>primary analyst(s) shall meet the requirements described in</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section and shall be</textblock>
    <textblock>responsible for the baseline audit per paragraph (f) of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b)</textblock>
    <textblock>Independence.</textblock>
    <textblock>The auditor, its contractors,</textblock>
    <textblock>subcontractors and their organizations shall be independent</textblock>
    <textblock>of the submitting organization. All of the criteria listed</textblock>

    <textblock>been employed by the refiner or importer at any time during</textblock>
    <textblock>the three (3) years preceding the date of hire of the</textblock>
    <textblock>auditor by the refiner or importer for baseline verification</textblock>
    <textblock>purposes.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Auditor personnel may have been a contractor or</textblock>

    <textblock>auditing, but not as an employee (per paragraph (b)(1)(i) of</textblock>
    <textblock>this section). Those involved only in the development of</textblock>
    <textblock>the baseline of the refiner or importer need not meet the</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements specified in this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Financial criteria.</textblock>
    <textblock>Neither the primary analyst,</textblock>
    <textblock>nor the auditing organization nor any organization or</textblock>
    <textblock>individual which may be contracted or subcontracted to</textblock>
    <textblock>supply baseline verification expertise shall:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Have received more than one quarter of its revenue</textblock>
    <textblock>from the refiner or importer during the year prior to the</textblock>
    <textblock>date of hire of the auditor by the refiner or importer for</textblock>

    <textblock>evaluating a baseline determination. It shall have</textblock>
    <textblock>personnel familiar with petroleum refining processes,</textblock>
