    <textblock>(C) If the refiner or importer can provide evidence that such gasoline blendstock was not blended per paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(A) or (B) of this section, and that such gasoline blendstock was sold with out further changes downstream, the fuel parameter values of the original product shall be included in the baseline determination.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Data on 1990 gasoline purchased or otherwise received, including intracompany transfers, shall not be included in the baseline determination of a refiner's or importer's facility if the gasoline exited the receiving refinery unchanged from its arrival state.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Method 2-type data.</textblock>
    <textblock>Method 2-type data shall consist of 1990 gasoline blendstock quality data and 1990 blendstock production records, specifically the measured fuel parameter values and volumes of blendstock used in the production of gasoline within the refinery. Blendstock data shall include volumes purchased or otherwise received, including intracompany transfers, if the volumes were blended as part of the refiner's or importer's 1990 gasoline. Henceforth in §§80.91 through 80.93, ``blendstock(s)'' or ``gasoline blendstock(s)'' shall include those products or streams commercially blended to form gasoline.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Method 3-type data.</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Method 3-type data shall consist of post-1990 gasoline blendstock and/or gasoline quality data and 1990 blendstock and gasoline production records, specifically the measured fuel parameter values and volumes of blendstock used in the production of gasoline within the refinery. Blendstock data shall include volumes purchased or otherwise received, including intracompany transfers, if the volumes were blended as part of the refiner's or importer's 1990 gasoline.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) In order to use Method 3-type data, the refiner or importer must do all of the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) Include a detailed discussion comparing its 1990 and post-1990 refinery operations and all other differences which would cause the 1990 and post-1990 fuel parameter values to differ; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) Perform the appropriate calculations so as to adjust for the differences determined in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(C) Include a narrative, discussing the methodology and reasoning for the adjustments made per paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) In order to use post-1990 gasoline data, either of the following must be shown for each blendstock-type included in 1990 gasoline, excluding butane:</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) The post-1990 volumetric fraction of a blendstock is within (+/^)10.0 percent of the volumetric fraction of that blendstock in 1990 gasoline. For example, if a 1990 blendstock constituted 30 volume percent of 1990 gasoline, this criterion would be met if the post-1990 volumetric fraction of the blendstock in post-1990 gasoline was 27.0-33.0 volume percent.</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) The post-1990 volumetric fraction of a blendstock is within (+/^)2.0 volume percent of the absolute value of the 1990 volumetric fraction. For example, if a 1990 blendstock constituted 5 volume percent of 1990 gasoline, this criterion would be met if the post-1990 volumetric fraction of the blendstock in post-1990 gasoline was 3-7 volume percent.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) If using post-1990 gasoline data, post-1990 gasoline blendstock which left a facility and which could become gasoline solely upon the addition of oxygenate shall be included in the baseline determination, per the requirements specified in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4)</textblock>
    <textblock>Hierarchy of data use.</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) A refiner or importer must determine a baseline fuel parameter value using only Method 1-type data if sufficient Method 1-type data is available, per paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) If a refiner has insufficient Method 1-type data for a baseline parameter value determination, it must supplement that data with all available Method 2-type data, until it has sufficient data, per paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) If a refiner has insufficient Method 1- and Method 2-type data for a baseline parameter value determination, it must supplement that data with all available Method 3-type data, until it has sufficient data, per paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) The protocol for the determination of baseline fuel parameter values in paragraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section shall be applied to each fuel parameter one at a time.</textblock>
    <textblock>(5)</textblock>
    <textblock>Anti-dumping statutory baseline.</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) The summer anti-dumping statutory baseline shall have the set of fuel parameter values identified as ``summer'' in §80.45(b)(2). The anti-dumping summer API gravity shall be 57.4</textblock>
    <textblock>○API.</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) The winter anti-dumping statutory baseline shall have the set of fuel parameter values identified as ``winter'' in §80.45(b)(2), except that winter RVP shall be 8.7 psi. The anti-dumping winter API gravity shall be 60.2 API.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) The annual average anti-dumping statutory baseline shall have the following set of fuel parameter values:</textblock>
    <textblock>Benzene, volume percent_1.60</textblock>
    <textblock>Aromatics, volume percent_28.6</textblock>
    <textblock>Olefins, volume percent_10.8</textblock>
    <textblock>RVP, psi_8.7</textblock>
