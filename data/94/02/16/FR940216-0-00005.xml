    <textblock>Corrections 5-8.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the definitions of ``Action plan,'' ``Certification,'' ``FSS account,'' ``Program Coordinating Committee,'' and ``Self-sufficiency'' in §962.103 (Definitions), the word ``subpart'' in each definition should be ``part.'' (See 58 FR 30889, third column, and 58 FR 30890, second and third columns.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Correction 9.</textblock>
    <textblock>In §962.302 (Administrative fees), the word ``eligible'' should be inserted after the words ``reasonable and'' in the fourth line of this paragraph. (See 58 FR 30893.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Correction 11.</textblock>
    <textblock>In §962.305 (FSS account), in paragraph (b)(1)(i), the second ``FSS'' should be followed by the word ``credit.'' (See 58 FR 30895, first column.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Correction 12.</textblock>
    <textblock>In §962.305(c), the heading ``Disbursement before expiration of contract term'' should be italicized to clarify that this is the heading for this paragraph. (See 58 FR 30895, second column.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Correction 13.</textblock>
    <textblock>In §962.305(e), the phrase ``unless such use is prohibited by the statute or regulations governing the particular homeownership program'' was inadvertently omitted. (See 58 FR 30895, third column.) This phrase is included in the comparable section in the Indian housing FSS regulations. (See §905.3024(e) at 58 FR 30889, first column.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Corrections 14-17.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the definitions of ``Action plan,'' ``Certification,'' ``FSS account,'' and ``Self-sufficiency'' in §984.103 (Definitions), the word ``subpart'' in each definition should be ``part.'' (See 58 FR 30896 middle column, and 58 FR 30897, first and second columns.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Correction 18.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the definition of ``FSS related service program'' in §984.103, the phrase ``of this subpart'' is unnecessary and should be omitted. (See 58 FR 30897.)</textblock>
    <textblock>This document will correct the above technical errors.</textblock>

The Department is reviewing these comments and may consider further amendments to the FSS final rule, after the rule becomes effective on May 27, 1994.</textblock>
