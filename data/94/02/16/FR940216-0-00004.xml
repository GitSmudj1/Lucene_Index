    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>On May 27, 1993 (58 FR 30858), the Department published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>an interim rule that implemented the requirements and procedures that will govern local Family Self-Sufficiency (FSS) programs beginning or continuing in Federal fiscal year (FY) 1993. The Department also published a final rule which adopted the interim rule as the final regulations for the Family Self-Sufficiency Program, and which final rule will be effective on May 27, 1994 (one year from the date of publication in accordance with the program's authorizing legislation). (The interim rule was effective 30 days from the date of publication and solicited public comment.)</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of this document is to correct editorial errors contained in the May 27, 1993 interim rule. The following provides a summary of the corrections that are being made by this document.</textblock>
    <textblock>Corrections 1 and 2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 106(j) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 (Pub. L. 102-550, approved October 28, 1992) made operation of a local FSS program optional for Indian housing authorities (IHAs) for the Indian housing program. For the Indian housing program, the FSS rule provides that IHAs that elect to operate local FSS programs are not subject to minimum program size requirements as are housing agencies (HAs) other than IHAs. Note that the part 962 regulations, which are the regulations applicable to the public housing FSS program, contain a section concerning minimum program size requirements_24 CFR 962.105 (Minimum program size). (See table of sections at 58 FR 30889.) No comparable section, however, is contained in the Indian housing FSS regulations. (See table of sections at 58 FR 30883).</textblock>
    <textblock>Two provisions in the Indian housing FSS regulations inadvertently make reference to minimum program size requirements_paragraph (a)(2) in §905.3020 (Program implementation) and §905.3021 (Administrative fees). (See 58 FR 30887, first column for both citations.) The last sentence of paragraph (a)(1) of §905.3020 also uses the phrase ``families</textblock>
    <textblock>required</textblock>
    <textblock>to be served'' (emphasis added) which indicates that IHAs are subject to minimum program size requirements. Accordingly, the reference to minimum program size requirements in these two sections is incorrect, and is removed by this notice.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, §905.3021 (Administrative fees) also contains a missing word. This section provides that the performance funding system (PFS) shall provide for the inclusion of ``reasonable and administrative costs.'' The correct phrase should be ``reasonable and</textblock>
    <textblock>eligible</textblock>
    <textblock>administrative costs.''</textblock>
    <textblock>Corrections 3, 10 and 19.</textblock>
    <textblock>In each of the three FSS rules (the Indian housing FSS rule, the public housing FSS rule, and the section 8 FSS rule), the phrase, ``without good cause,'' should have been inserted where the rule discusses termination of the FSS contract of participation on the basis of the family's failure to comply with the contract terms. Accordingly, this phrase is added to §905.3022 (b)(5) and (h)(2), §962.303 (b)(5) and (h)(2), and §984.303 (b)(5) and (i). (See, respectively, 58 FR 30887 (second column), 30894 (first column), and 30900 (third column)).</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition to inserting the phrase ``without good cause'' in §984.303(b)(5), the word ``without'' in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section should be ``withhold.'' (See 58 FR 30900).</textblock>
    <textblock>Correction 4.</textblock>
    <textblock>In §905.3024(b) (Total tenant payment and increases in family income), the second ``or'' should be ``for.'' (See 58 FR 3088, second column.)</textblock>
