    <textblock>(i) Any averaged reformulated gasoline from that refinery or oxygenate blending facility supplied the covered area during any year a survey was conducted which gave rise to a standards adjustment; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Any averaged reformulated gasoline from that refinery or oxygenate blending facility supplies the covered area during any year that the standards are more stringent than the initial standards; unless</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) The refiner or oxygenate blender is able to show that the volume of averaged reformulated gasoline from a refinery or oxygenate blending facility that supplied the covered area during any year under paragraphs (q)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section was less than one percent of the reformulated gasoline produced at the refinery or oxygenate blending facility during that year, or 100,000 barrels, whichever is less.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Adjusted standards for a covered area apply to averaged reformulated gasoline that is imported by an importer if:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) The covered area with the adjusted standard is located in Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD) I, and the gasoline is imported at a facility located in PADDs I, II or III;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) The covered area with the adjusted standard is located in PADD II, and the gasoline is imported at a facility located in PADDs I, II, III, or IV;</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) The covered area with the adjusted standard is located in PADD III, and the gasoline is imported at a facility located in PADDs II, III, or IV;</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) The covered area with the adjusted standard is located in PADD IV, and the gasoline is imported at a facility located in PADDs II, or IV; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(v) The covered area with the adjusted standard is located in PADD V, and the gasoline is imported at a facility located in PADDs III, IV, or V; unless</textblock>
    <textblock>(vi) Any gasoline which is imported by an importer at any facility located in any PADD supplies the covered area, in which case the adjusted standard also applies to averaged gasoline imported at that facility by that importer.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Any gasoline that is transported in a fungible manner by a pipeline, barge, or vessel shall be considered to have supplied each covered area that is supplied with any gasoline by that pipeline, or barge or vessel shipment, unless the refiner or importer is able to establish that the gasoline it produced or imported was supplied only to a smaller number of covered areas.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Adjusted standards apply to all averaged reformulated gasoline produced by a refinery or imported by an importer identified in this paragraph (q), except:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) In the case of adjusted VOC standards for a covered area located in VOC Control Region 1, the adjusted VOC standards apply only to averaged reformulated gasoline designated as VOC-controlled intended for use in VOC Control Region 1; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) In the case of adjusted VOC standards for a covered area located in VOC Control Region 2, the adjusted VOC standards apply only to averaged reformulated gasoline designated as VOC-controlled intended for use in VOC Control Region 2.</textblock>
