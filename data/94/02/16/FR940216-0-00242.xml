    <textblock>any of the gasoline giving rise to the violations such that</textblock>
    <textblock>the said gasoline or mixture of gasolines has the properties</textblock>
    <textblock>and characteristics that would have existed if the gasoline</textblock>

    <textblock>remained any place in the gasoline distribution system for</textblock>
    <textblock>fewer than or more than twenty-five days.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e)(1) Any reformulated gasoline that is</textblock>
    <textblock>produced or imported and offered for sale and for which the</textblock>
