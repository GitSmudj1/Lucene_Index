    <textblock>produced or imported before January 1, 1995.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the case of</textblock>
    <textblock>any reformulated gasoline that is intended to be used</textblock>
    <textblock>beginning January 1, 1995, but that is produced or imported</textblock>
    <textblock>prior to that date:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Any refiner or importer may meet standards</textblock>
    <textblock>specified in ยง80.41 for average compliance for such</textblock>
    <textblock>gasoline, provided the refiner or importer has the option of</textblock>
    <textblock>meeting standards on average for 1995 under paragraph (a) of</textblock>
    <textblock>this section, and provided the refiner or importer elects to</textblock>
    <textblock>be subject to average standards under ยง80.65(c)(3); and</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Any average compliance gasoline under paragraph</textblock>
    <textblock>(i)(1) of this section shall be combined with average</textblock>
    <textblock>compliance gasoline produced during 1995 for purposes of</textblock>
    <textblock>compliance calculations under paragraph (g) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง80.68</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance surveys.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a)</textblock>
    <textblock>Compliance survey option 1.</textblock>
    <textblock>In order to satisfy</textblock>
    <textblock>the compliance survey requirements, any refiner, importer,</textblock>
    <textblock>or oxygenate blender shall properly conduct a program of</textblock>
    <textblock>compliance surveys in accordance with a survey program plan</textblock>
    <textblock>which has been approved by the Administrator of EPA in each</textblock>
    <textblock>covered area which is supplied with any gasoline for which</textblock>
    <textblock>compliance is achieved on average that is produced by that</textblock>
    <textblock>refiner or oxygenate blender or imported by that importer.</textblock>
    <textblock>Such approval shall be based upon the survey program plan</textblock>
    <textblock>meeting the following criteria:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The survey program shall consist of at least four</textblock>
    <textblock>surveys which shall occur during the following time periods:</textblock>
    <textblock>one survey during the period January 1 through May 31; two</textblock>
    <textblock>surveys during the period June 1 through September 15; and</textblock>
    <textblock>one survey during the period September 16 through December</textblock>
    <textblock>31.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The survey program shall meet the criteria stated</textblock>
    <textblock>in paragraph (c) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) In the event that any refiner, importer, or</textblock>
    <textblock>oxygenate blender fails to properly carry out an approved</textblock>
    <textblock>survey program, the refiner, importer, or oxygenate blender</textblock>
    <textblock>shall achieve compliance with all applicable standards on a</textblock>
    <textblock>per-gallon basis for the calendar year in which the failure</textblock>
    <textblock>occurs, and may not achieve compliance with any standard on</textblock>
    <textblock>an average basis during this calendar year. This</textblock>
    <textblock>requirement to achieve compliance per-gallon shall apply</textblock>
    <textblock>ab</textblock>
    <textblock>initio</textblock>
    <textblock>to the beginning of any calendar year in which the</textblock>
    <textblock>failure occurs, regardless of when during the year the</textblock>
    <textblock>failure occurs.</textblock>
