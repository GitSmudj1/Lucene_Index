    <textblock>STATUS:</textblock>
    <textblock>Open to the public for observation and comment, limited only by space available. The meeting room will accommodate approximately 100 people.</textblock>
    <textblock>PURPOSE:</textblock>
    <textblock>Under a Memorandum of Understanding signed in December 1990 with the Department of Energy (DOE), the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been given the responsibility and resources for conducting analytic epidemiologic investigations of residents of communities in the vicinity of DOE facilities and other persons potentially exposed to radiation or to potential hazards from non-nuclear energy production and use. HHS delegated program responsibility to CDC.</textblock>
    <textblock>CDC has begun an environmental dose reconstruction for DOE's Idaho National Engineering Laboratory (INEL) near Idaho Falls, Idaho. Sanford Cohen &amp; Associates (SC&amp;A) is gathering the data necessary to perform the dose reconstruction under contract to CDC. SC&amp;A has formed a working group made up of Idaho citizens. The working group's primary purpose is to follow the project's progress and provide input in SC&amp;A's planning process.</textblock>
    <textblock>The working group meetings are intended to promote direct public input into Phase I of the INEL Dose Reconstruction Project. Topics will focus particularly on technical and operational issues to help improve and expedite the process of identifying and retrieving documents relevant to a dose reconstruction for INEL.</textblock>
    <textblock>The public information meetings are to: (1) share information about SC&amp;A's working group, (2) provide the public an opportunity to review actual records that have been entered into the database; and (3) gain input from the public on the project.</textblock>
    <textblock>Agenda items are subject to change as priorities dictate.</textblock>
    <textblock>CONTACT PERSON FOR MORE INFORMATION:</textblock>
