    <textblock>(B) In the case computer-controlled in-line blending</textblock>
    <textblock>is not used, a rate of not less than one sample per each one</textblock>
    <textblock>hundred occasions RBOB and oxygenate are blended in a truck</textblock>
    <textblock>by that oxygenate blender, or one sample per month,</textblock>
    <textblock>whichever is more frequent;</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Sampling and testing shall be of the gasoline</textblock>
    <textblock>produced through one of the RBOB-oxygenate blends produced</textblock>
    <textblock>by that oxygenate blender;</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) Samples shall be analyzed for oxygenate type and</textblock>
    <textblock>oxygen content using the testing methodology specified at</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง80.46; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(v) In the event the testing results for any sample</textblock>
    <textblock>indicate the gasoline does not contain the specified type</textblock>
    <textblock>and amount of oxygenate (within the ranges specified in</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง80.70(b)(2)(i)):</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) Immediately stop selling (or where possible, to</textblock>
    <textblock>stop any transferee of the gasoline from selling) the</textblock>
    <textblock>gasoline which was sampled;</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) Take steps to determine the cause of the</textblock>
    <textblock>noncompliance;</textblock>
    <textblock>(C) Increase the rate of sampling and testing to one</textblock>
    <textblock>of the following rates:</textblock>
    <textblock>(</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>) In the case computer-controlled in-line blending</textblock>
    <textblock>is used, a rate of not less than one sample per each two</textblock>
    <textblock>hundred and fifty occasions RBOB and oxygenate are loaded</textblock>
    <textblock>into a truck by that oxygenate blender, or one sample every</textblock>
    <textblock>six weeks, whichever is more frequent; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>) In the case computer-controlled in-line blending</textblock>
    <textblock>is not used, a rate of not less than one sample per each</textblock>
    <textblock>fifty occasions RBOB and oxygenate are blended in a truck by</textblock>
    <textblock>that oxygenate blender, or one sample every two weeks,</textblock>
    <textblock>whichever is more frequent; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(D) This increased frequency shall continue until the</textblock>
    <textblock>results of ten consecutive samples and tests indicate the</textblock>
    <textblock>gasoline complies with applicable standards, at which time</textblock>
    <textblock>the frequency may revert to the original frequency.</textblock>

    <textblock>Oxygenate blending with OPRG.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notwithstanding the</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements for and restrictions on oxygenate blending</textblock>
    <textblock>provided in this section, any oxygenate blender may blend</textblock>
    <textblock>oxygenate with reformulated gasoline that is designated as</textblock>
    <textblock>OPRG, without meeting the record keeping and reporting</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements that otherwise apply to oxygenate blenders,</textblock>
    <textblock>provided that the reformulated gasoline so produced is:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Used in an oxygenated fuels program control area</textblock>
    <textblock>during an oxygenated fuels program control period; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) ``Substantially similar'' under section 211(f)(1) of</textblock>
