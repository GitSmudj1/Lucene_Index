    <textblock>Disclosure to consumer reporting agencies:</textblock>
    <textblock>Disclosure pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(b)(12):</textblock>
    <textblock>Disclosure may be made from this system to ``consumer reporting agencies'' as defined in the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a(f) or the Federal Claims Collection Act of 1966 (31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(3)). The purpose of this disclosure is to aid in the collection of outstanding debts owed to the Federal Government, typically, to provide an incentive for debtors to repay delinquent Federal Government debts by making these debts part of their credit records. Disclosure of records is limited to the individual's name, address, Social Security number, and other information necessary to establish the individual's identity; the amount, status and history of the claim; and the agency or program under which the claim arose. The disclosure will be made only after the procedural requirements of 31 U.S.C. 3711(f) have been followed.</textblock>
    <textblock>Policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, and disposing of records in the system: Storage:</textblock>
    <textblock>Hard copy documents are manually filed at agency and regional office sites; and on disc pack and magnetic tape at central computer sites.</textblock>
    <textblock>Retrievability:</textblock>
    <textblock>This varies according to the particular accounting system within the Operating Division, Agency and Regional Office. Usually the hard copy document is filed by name within accounting classification. Computer records may be indexed by social security number and voucher number. Intra-departmental uses and transfers concern the validation and certification for payment, and for HHS internal audits.</textblock>
    <textblock>Safeguards:</textblock>
    <textblock>1.</textblock>
    <textblock>Authorized users:</textblock>
    <textblock>Employees and officials directly responsible for programmatic or fiscal activity, including administrative and staff personnel, financial management personnel, computer personnel, and managers who have responsibilities for implementing HHS funded programs.</textblock>
    <textblock>2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Physical safeguards:</textblock>
    <textblock>File folders, reports and other forms of personnel data, and electronic diskettes are stored in areas where fire and life safety codes are strictly enforced. All documents and diskettes are protected during lunch hours and nonworking hours in locked file cabinets or locked storage areas. Magnetic tapes and computer matching tapes are locked in a computer room and tape vault.</textblock>
    <textblock>3.</textblock>
    <textblock>Procedural safeguards:</textblock>
    <textblock>Password protection of automated records is provided. All authorized users protect information from public view and from unauthorized personnel entering an office. The safeguards described above were established in accordance with HHS Chapter 45-13 of the General Administration Manual; and the HHS ADP Systems Manual Part 6, ``ADP Systems Security.''</textblock>
    <textblock>Retention and disposal:</textblock>
    <textblock>Records are purged from automated files once the accounting purpose has been served; printed copy and manual documents are retained and disposed of in accordance with General Accounting Office principles and standards as authorized by the National Archives and Records Service.</textblock>
    <textblock>System manager(s) and address:</textblock>
    <textblock>See Appendix 2.</textblock>
    <textblock>Notification procedure:</textblock>
    <textblock>Inquiries are to be made, either in writing or in person, to the organizations listed under ``Location'' in appendix 1, with the exception of Food and Drug Administration records. For those records, contact: FDA Privacy Act Coordinator (HFW-30), Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane, Rockville, MD 20857.</textblock>
    <textblock>Give name and social security number, purpose of payment or collection (travel, grant, etc.) and, if possible, the agency accounting classification.</textblock>
    <textblock>Record access procedure:</textblock>
    <textblock>Same as notification procedures. Requesters should also clearly specify the record contents being sought, and may include a request for an accounting of disclosures that have been made of their records, if any. (These access procedures are in accordance with Department regulations (45 CFR 5b.5(a)(2)).)</textblock>
    <textblock>Contesting record procedure:</textblock>
    <textblock>Contact the official at the address specified under notification procedure above, and reasonably identify the record and specify the information being contested, the corrective action sought, and the reasons for requesting the correction, along with supporting information to show how the record is inaccurate, incomplete, untimely or irrelevant.</textblock>
    <textblock>Record source categories:</textblock>
    <textblock>Travel vouchers submitted by the individual; grant, contract and loan award document; delinquent loan, grant and scholarship record; consultant invoice of services rendered; and application for travel advance.</textblock>
    <textblock>Systems exempted from certain provisions of the act:</textblock>
    <textblock>None.</textblock>
