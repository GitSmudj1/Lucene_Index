    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council's Reef Fish Advisory Panel will hold a meeting on March 3, 1994, at the Radisson Inn New Orleans Airport, 2150 Veterans Memorial Boulevard, Kenner, Louisiana; telephone: (504) 467-3111. The meeting will be held from 12 p.m to 4 p.m.</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of the meeting is to review proposed Draft Amendment 9 to the Fishery Management Plan for the Reef Fish Fishery of the Gulf of Mexico. Draft Amendment 9 includes management measures to collect historical landings data from fishermen, to extend the reef fish permit moratorium and red snapper endorsement system, and to provide partial red snapper endorsements in 1995 to historical captains if the red snapper endorsement system is extended. The historical landings data will be used to establish the eligibility of fishermen if a system to limit access to the red snapper fishery is implemented based on individual transferable quotas (ITQs) or license limitations. Individuals would be notified of their potential allocation.</textblock>
