    <textblock>(f) Select a representative sample of reformulated gasoline and RBOB batches produced by computerized in-line blending, and for this sample:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Obtain the composite sample internal laboratory analyses results; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Agree the results of the internal laboratory analyses to the quarterly batch information submitted to the EPA.</textblock>
    <textblock>(g) Select a representative sample from the listing of the tenders of conventional gasoline and conventional gasoline blendstock that becomes gasoline through the addition of oxygenate only, and for this sample:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Agree the volumes to the product transfer documents;</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) For a representative sample of tenders, trace back to the batch or batches in which the gasoline was produced or imported. Obtain the refiner's or importer's internal laboratory analyses for each batch and compare such analyses for consistency with the analyses results reported to EPA; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Where the refiner or importer has included oxygenate that is blended downstream of the refinery or import facility in its compliance calculations in accordance with §80.101(d)(4)(ii), obtain a listing of each downstream oxygenate blending operation from which the refiner or importer is claiming oxygenate for use in compliance calculations, and for each such operation:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Determine if the refiner or importer had a contract in place with the downstream blender during the period oxygenate was blended;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Determine if the refiner or importer has records reflecting that it conducted physical inspections of the downstream blending operation during the period oxygenate was blended;</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Obtain a listing from the refiner or importer of the batches of conventional gasoline or conventional sub-octane blendstock, and the compliance calculations for which include oxygenate blended by the downstream oxygenate blender, and test the mathematical accuracy of the calculations contained in this listing;</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) Obtain a listing from the downstream oxygenate blender of the oxygenate blended with conventional gasoline or sub-octane blendstock that was produced or imported by the refiner or importer. Test the mathematical accuracy of the calculations in this listing. Agree the overall oxygenate blending listing obtained from the refiner or importer with the listing obtained from the downstream oxygenate blender. Select a representative sample of oxygenate blending listing obtained from the downstream oxygenate blender, and for this sample:</textblock>
    <textblock>(A) Using product transfer documents, determine if the oxygenate was blended with conventional gasoline or conventional sub-octane blendstock that was produced by the refiner or imported by the importer; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) Agree the oxygenate volume with the refiner's or importer's listing of oxygenate claimed for this gasoline;</textblock>
    <textblock>(v) Obtain a listing of the sampling and testing conducted by the refiner or importer over the downstream oxygenate blending operation. Select a representative sample of the test results from this listing, and for this sample agree the tested oxygenate volume with the oxygenate use listings from the refiner or importer, and from the oxygenate blender; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(vi) Obtain a copy of the records reflecting the refiner or importer audit over the downstream oxygenate blending operation. Review these records for indications that the audit included review of the overall volumes and type of oxygenate purchased and used by the oxygenate blender to be consistent with the oxygenate claimed by the refiner or importer and that this oxygenate was blended with the refiner's or importer's gasoline or blending stock.</textblock>
    <textblock>(h) In the case of a refiner or importer that is not exempt from blendstock tracking under §80.102(f):</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) Obtain listings for those tenders of non-finished-gasoline classified by the refiner or importer as:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Applicable blendstock which is included in the refiner's or importer's blendstock tracking calculations pursuant to §80.102(b) through (d);</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Applicable blendstock which is exempt pursuant to §80.102(d)(3) from inclusion in the refiner's or importer's blendstock tracking calculations pursuant to §80.102 (b) through (d); and</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) All other non-finished-gasoline petroleum products.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Test the mathematical accuracy of the calculations contained in the analysis.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) Agree the listings of tenders' volumes to the gasoline inventory reconciliation in paragraph (b) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(4) Agree the EPA report for the volume classified as applicable blendstock pursuant to the requirements of §</textblock>
    <textblock>80.102.</textblock>
    <textblock>(5) Select a representative sample from the listing of applicable blendstock which is reported to EPA, and for such sample:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Agree the volumes to records supporting the transfer of the tender to another person; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Trace back to the batch or batches in which the non-finished-gasoline petroleum product was produced or imported. Obtain the refiner's or importer's internal laboratory analysis for each batch and compare such analysis for consistency with the product type assigned by the refiner or importer (e.g., reformate, light coker naphtha, etc.), and that this product type is included in the applicable blendstock list at §80.102(a).</textblock>
    <textblock>(6) Select a representative sample from the listing of applicable blendstock which is exempt from inclusion in the blendstock tracking report to EPA, and for such sample:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Agree the volumes to records supporting the transfer of the tender to another person;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Trace back to the batch or batches in which the non-finished-gasoline petroleum product was produced or imported. Obtain the refiner's or importer's internal laboratory analysis for each batch and compare such analysis for consistency with the product type assigned by the refiner or importer (e.g., reformate, light coker naphtha, etc.), and that this product type is included in the applicable blendstock list at §80.102(a); and</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Obtain the documents that demonstrate the purpose for which the product was used, and agree that the documented purpose is one of those specified at §80.102(d)(3).</textblock>
    <textblock>(7) Select a representative sample from the listing of all other non-finished-gasoline petroleum products, and for such sample:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Agree the volumes to records supporting the transfer of the tender to another person;</textblock>
