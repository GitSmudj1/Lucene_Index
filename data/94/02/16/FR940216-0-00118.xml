    <textblock>3. NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>averaging</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA proposed that the NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>complex model standard would be a 0% emissions performance increase under Phase I of the complex model before 2000. Under Phase II of the complex model beginning in 2000, EPA proposed a range of NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>standards, from a 0% emissions performance increase to a 15% emissions performance decrease. Averaging was not proposed as a compliance option for NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>. In the final rule, EPA has finalized the Phase II NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>standards, and has allowed for NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>averaging under both Phase I and Phase II.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under Phase I in the final rule, the NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>per-gallon standard remains at the proposed level of a 0% emissions performance increase. The final rule also provides an average standard for NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>compliance of a 1.5% emissions performance reduction, which is more stringent than the per-gallon standard, and with an associated per-gallon minimum NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>standard of a 2.5% emissions performance increase.</textblock>
    <textblock>EPA believes that the most appropriate interpretation of section 211(k)(2)(A) is that the NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>emissions performance of reformulated gasoline should be at the level expected from a 0% NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>increase standard on a per-gallon basis. This approach guarantees no increase in NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>emissions, and is a reasonable interpretation of this provision. At the same time, EPA does not believe that NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>averaging is precluded in all cases under this provision. The text of section 211(k)(2)(A) is not explicit on this point, and the certification provision of section 211(k)(4) would appear to allow averaging over a slate of fuels.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Phase I NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>averaging provisions are designed such that the average NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>performance of reformulated gasoline should be the same under either standard. Given this result, and the discretion afforded the Administrator in section 211 (k)(2)(A) and (k)(4), the NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>averaging provisions under Phase I complex model standards is a reasonable way to implement this statutory requirement.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under Phase II, the NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>standards are different for VOC-controlled versus non-VOC-controlled gasoline. Non-VOC-controlled gasoline has the same per-gallon, average, and per-gallon minimum standards as under Phase I. The NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>standards for VOC-controlled gasoline under Phase II require a NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>reduction: A 5.5% emissions performance reduction in the case of the per-gallon standard, and a 6.8% emissions performance reduction in the case of the average standard. In addition, the average standard has an associated per-gallon minimum NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>standard of a 3.0% emissions performance reduction. The rationale for requiring NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>reductions in conjunction with VOC-controlled gasoline under Phase II is discussed more fully in section VI of the preamble.</textblock>
    <textblock>The general approach used for setting the average NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>standards, and the per-gallon NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>minimums associated with the average standards, is the same as for other average and per-gallon minimums/maximums for reformulated gasoline. The average standard is set at a level that is equal to the per-gallon standard plus the ``margin-of-safety'' refiners would use to ensure compliance if only a per-gallon standard were allowed. EPA estimates this ``margin-of-safety'' would be 1.5% in the case of VOC and toxics emissions performance. In the case of NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>emissions performance, EPA estimates the ``margin-of-safety'' also would be 1.5% during Phase I, but during Phase II would be 1.3%.</textblock>
    <textblock>The per-gallon minimum is included in order to cap the averaging range. It is set at a level that is 2.5% less stringent than the per-gallon standard in the case of VOC, toxics, and NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>emissions performance. Limiting the averaging range is one of the mechanisms included in the final rule to ensure each covered area receives reformulated gasoline that on average provides the air quality benefits Congress intended for reformulated gasoline. The relationship between per-gallon and average standards, and the need for per-gallon minimums and maximums, are discussed in the 1992 SNPRM at 57 FR 13455-13458.</textblock>
    <textblock>The final rule requires that the NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>averaging standards under both Phase I and Phase II must be met separately for gasoline and RBOB that is designated VOC-controlled and for gasoline and RBOB that is not designated as VOC-controlled. This separate averaging is necessary in order to ensure that the ozone reduction benefits deriving from the NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>reductions occur during the high ozone season. If the VOC-controlled and non-VOC-controlled gasoline could be averaged together over the entire calendar year NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>averaging period, there is the possibility that gasoline in the non-VOC-controlled category could have sufficient NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>reductions that, through averaging, gasoline in the VOC-controlled category would not have the intended NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>reductions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Separate NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>averaging for VOC-controlled and non-VOC-controlled gasoline also is necessary to ensure that both the VOC-controlled and the non-VOC-controlled categories of gasoline comply with the no increase in NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>emissions performance instruction of section 211(k)(2)(A) of the Act. If VOC-controlled and non-VOC-controlled gasoline could be averaged together, there is the possibility that the gasoline in one category or the other would have greater NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>emissions performance reductions than is required, with the consequence that the gasoline in the other category could have a NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>emissions performance increase. Requiring separate NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>averaging for VOC-controlled and non-VOC-controlled gasoline prevents this possibility.</textblock>
    <textblock>In a departure from the general approach used for average standards, there is no gasoline quality survey prerequisite for use of the complex model Phase II NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>average standard for VOC-controlled gasoline. The gasoline quality surveys serve the purpose of ensuring that the minimum reformulated gasoline requirements of section 211(k) are met in each covered area when averaging is used. The minimum per gallon NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>reductions required under Phase II for VOC-controlled gasoline go beyond the minimum requirements of section 211(k), however, so there is certainty the minimum NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements of section 211(k)(2)(A) (no NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>increase) will be met in each covered area without the need for surveys and possible ratchets.</textblock>
