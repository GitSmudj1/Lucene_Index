  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>Through the amended Clean Air Act of 1990, Congress mandated that EPA promulgate new regulations requiring that gasoline sold in certain areas be reformulated to reduce vehicle emissions of toxic and ozone-forming compounds. This document finalizes the rules for the certification and enforcement of reformulated gasoline and provisions for unreformulated or conventional gasoline.</textblock>
  </summary>
  <date>
    <textblock>DATES:</textblock>
    <textblock>The regulations for the reformulated gasoline program are effective on March 18, 1994. The incorporation by reference of certain publications listed in the regulations is approved by the Director of the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>as of March 18, 1994. The information collection requirements contained in 40 CFR part 80 have not been approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) and are not effective until OMB has approved them. EPA will publish a document in the Federal Register following OMB approval of the information collection requirements.</textblock>
    <textblock>Retail sale of reformulated gasoline will begin on January 1, 1995, as will the provisions for the ``simple model'' certification, the anti-dumping program for conventional gasoline, and the associated enforcement procedures. (For all ensuing sections of this document, the program's beginning date of January 1, 1995 refers only to the retail sale of reformulated gasoline.) Certification of reformulated gasoline by the ``complex model'' and compliance with the Phase II performance standards, will begin January 1, 1998 and January 1, 2000, respectively.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Today's final rule is preceded by four previous notices: an initial notice proposing standards for reformulated and conventional gasoline (NPRM) published on July 9, 1991 (56 FR 31176), a supplemental notice (SNPRM) published on April 16, 1992 (57 FR 13416), an additional NPRM published on February 26, 1993 (58 FR 11722), and a notice of correction for Phase II standards published on April 1, 1993 (58 FR 17175). Insofar as the rules finalized today mirror the proposed standards, those previous documents may be referred to.</textblock>
    <textblock>Today's preamble explains the basis and purpose of the final rule, focusing on issues that have been revised since the publication of the correction notice for the Phase II performance standards (58 FR 17175). Support documents, including the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), are available in Public Docket No. A-92-12.</textblock>
