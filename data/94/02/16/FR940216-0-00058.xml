    <textblock>Exhaust Emissions Model</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Data Sources</textblock>
    <textblock>The relationship between fuel properties and exhaust emissions is complex and the theory behind such relationships continues to be developed. As a result, EPA has asked industry, state regulatory agencies, and other organizations with relevant test data to make their data available to the Agency to ensure that this rule is based on as much relevant information as possible. The complex model described in the following section is based on data generated from a number of exhaust emissions testing programs. These programs, their design intent, and their limitations are discussed in Section IV.A of the RIA. Data from these programs were excluded from EPA's analysis if the data were not based on a valid FTP measurement cycle, if the vehicle in question did not employ 1990-equivalent emission control technology, if the vehicles did not exhibit stable, repeatable emissions performance, or if the data were clearly inconsistent with the bulk of the data available to EPA (based on statistical considerations). In addition, data from programs that did not measure nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions were not used to develop EPA's exhaust VOC complex model. The Agency believes its analysis considered all valid, and relevant data on the exhaust emissions effect of fuel modifications when used in 1990 model year and equivalent vehicles that was available at the time the model was developed.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Analysis Method</textblock>
    <textblock>Exhaust emissions are affected by both vehicle and fuel characteristics. Since the test programs described above generally involved different vehicles, different fuels, and in some cases different test procedures, the analysis required to determine the relationship between fuel properties and emissions is complex. However, EPA believes that the methods used to develop the complex model considers and addresses these complexities appropriately. EPA utilized statistical analysis techniques to isolate the effects of fuel modifications on exhaust emissions of VOC, NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>, and toxics from other factors affecting exhaust emissions.</textblock>
    <textblock>At a series of six public workshops held over the past two years, the Agency presented its views on data sources, analysis methods, and preliminary emissions models for public review and comment. The Agency also requested other organizations to share their data, analysis expertise, and emissions models at these workshops. The methods used to develop the model promulgated today appropriately incorporate the comments and suggestions regarding the analysis process received at the workshops, as well as other comments and suggestions received from industry, state and federal government authorities, and other interested parties during the course of this rulemaking. Information regarding the workshops, public comments and suggestions, and EPA's analysis methods can be found in Docket A-92-12. The approach chosen by EPA to analyze the available data is summarized below and is discussed more fully in Section IV.A of the RIA.</textblock>
    <textblock>Since the vehicle and the fuel both affect exhaust emissions, EPA's analysis separated exhaust emissions into fuel components and vehicle components. In all test programs analyzed by EPA, the single most significant determinant of the level of emissions from a given vehicle on a given fuel was the vehicle itself. Fuel properties exert a much smaller influence on exhaust emissions than do vehicle characteristics such as emission control system technology, vehicle mileage, catalyst efficiency, oxygen sensor efficiency, engine size, engine design, vehicle size, fuel efficiency, vehicle maintenance, etc. To identify the effects of fuel property modifications on emissions, EPA found it necessary to identify the effect of each vehicle on emissions and separate this effect from the fuel effects. For vehicles used in more than one test program, EPA found it necessary to determine the vehicle effect separately for each test program since vehicle effects were observed to change between studies.</textblock>
    <textblock>The fuel components of exhaust emissions were separated into two main categories. The first category consisted of the effects of individual fuel parameters. For example, the effect of sulfur on NO</textblock>
    <textblock>X</textblock>
    <textblock>emissions was best modeled by a relationship containing a linear sulfur term (of the form c</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>S, where c</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>is a constant and S is the sulfur level) and a second-order sulfur term (of the form c</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>S</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>, where c</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>is a constant). The second category of fuel terms consisted of interactive effects between two fuel parameters. For example, EPA's analysis found that the effect of aromatics on hydrocarbon emissions is related to the E300 level of the fuel. This effect cannot be represented as an aromatics or E300 effect alone but must be represented as an interactive term of the form c</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>AE, where c</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>is a constant, A is the aromatics level, and E is the E300 level.</textblock>
