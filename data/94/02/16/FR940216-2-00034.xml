The Board's History Areas Committee will next present recommendations regarding a Special Resource Study of New Bedford, Massachusetts, then a number of National Historic Landmark nominations and related topics for consideration. Later in the day, the Board's Historic Preservation Performance Review Committee will propose recommendations for deliberation and adoption by the Board, as will the Board's Humanities Committee. Other miscellaneous topics and reports may also be covered. The order of the agenda may be changed, if necessary, to accommodate travel schedules or for other reasons.</textblock>
