    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposes to amend the system notice for its system of records 09-90-0024, the Financial Transactions of HHS Accounting and Finance Offices, by adding routine use Number 16. This routine use would enable the Department to disclose necessary information to automated data processing contractors that have been hired to develop, test, or operate automated data processing systems to be used for processing the financial and accounting transactions of HHS.</textblock>
  </summary>
  <date>
    <textblock>DATES:</textblock>
    <textblock>HHS invites interested parties to submit comments on the proposed routine use on or before March 18, 1994. HHS has sent a Report of Altered System to the Congress and to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on February 10, 1994. The alteration to the system will be effective 40 days from the date submitted to OMB unless HHS receives comments which would result in a contrary determination.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The system notice was last published at 53 FR 11707 (1988). The proposed routine use is to enable the agency to disclose to a contractor so that it can develop, test, or operate automated data processing systems to be used for processing these financial transactions. This use meets the compatibility of purpose criterion since the financial records have been collected to process and keep track of individual financial transactions, and the automated data processing system being serviced by the contractor will be used for that purpose.</textblock>
