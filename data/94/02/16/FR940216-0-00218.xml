    <textblock>each sample identified by EPA under paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B)</textblock>
    <textblock>of this section, determine the value for each property using</textblock>
    <textblock>the methodologies specified in ยง80.46.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)(i) Any refiner or importer shall designate</textblock>
    <textblock>one independent laboratory for each refinery or import</textblock>
    <textblock>facility at which reformulated gasoline or RBOB is produced</textblock>

    <textblock>shall be considered independent if it is owned or operated</textblock>
    <textblock>by a gasoline pipeline company, regardless of ownership or</textblock>
    <textblock>operation of the gasoline pipeline company by refiners or</textblock>
    <textblock>importers, provided that such pipeline company is owned and</textblock>
    <textblock>operated by four or more refiners or importers.</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) Use of a laboratory that is debarred, suspended,</textblock>
    <textblock>or proposed for debarment pursuant to the Governmentwide</textblock>
