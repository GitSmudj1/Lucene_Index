    <textblock>Budget and Accounting Act of 1950 (Pub. L. 81-784). Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365).</textblock>
    <textblock>Purpose(s):</textblock>
    <textblock>These records are an integral part of the accounting systems at operating division, agency, regional office and specific area locations. The records are used to keep track of all payments to individuals, exclusive of salaries and wages, based upon prior entry into the systems of the official commitment and obligation of government funds. When an individual is to repay funds advanced as a loan or scholarship, etc., the records will be used to establish a receivable record and to track repayment status. In the event of an overpayment to an individual, the record is used to establish a receivable record for recovery of the amount claimed. The records are also used internally to develop reports to the Internal Revenue Service and applicable state and local taxing officials of taxable income. This is a Departmentwide notice of payment and collection activities at all locations listed in Appendix 1.</textblock>
