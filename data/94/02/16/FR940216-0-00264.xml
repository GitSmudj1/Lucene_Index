    <textblock>(ii) For each averaging period until January 1, 1998, calculate the peak year blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change according to the following formula:</textblock>
    <textblock>Where:</textblock>
    <textblock>PC</textblock>
    <textblock>p</textblock>
    <textblock>=Peak year blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change</textblock>
    <textblock>BG</textblock>
    <textblock>a</textblock>
    <textblock>=Blendstock-to-gasoline ratio for the averaging period calculated under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section</textblock>
    <textblock>BG</textblock>
    <textblock>p</textblock>
    <textblock>=Largest one year blendstock-to-gasoline ratio calculated under paragraph (b) of this section</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Beginning on January 1, 1998, for each averaging period any refiner or importer shall:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Determine the running cumulative compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio according to the following formula:</textblock>
    <textblock>Where:</textblock>
    <textblock>BGC</textblock>
    <textblock>comp</textblock>
    <textblock>=Running cumulative compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio</textblock>
    <textblock>V</textblock>
    <textblock>bs, i</textblock>
    <textblock>=Volume of applicable blendstock produced or imported and transferred to others during averaging period i</textblock>
    <textblock>V</textblock>
    <textblock>g, i</textblock>
    <textblock>=Volume of conventional gasoline, reformulated gasoline, and RBOB produced or imported during averaging period i</textblock>
    <textblock>i=The current averaging period, and each of the three immediately preceding averaging periods</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Calculate the cumulative blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change according to the following formula:</textblock>
    <textblock>Where:</textblock>
    <textblock>PC</textblock>
    <textblock>c</textblock>
    <textblock>=Cumulative blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change</textblock>
    <textblock>BGC</textblock>
    <textblock>comp</textblock>
    <textblock>=Running cumulative compliance period blendstock-to-gasoline ratio as determined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section</textblock>
    <textblock>BGC</textblock>
    <textblock>base</textblock>
    <textblock>=Baseline cumulative blendstock-to-gasoline ratio calculated under paragraph (c) of this section</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) For purposes of this paragraph (d), all applicable blendstocks produced or imported shall be included, except those for which the refiner or importer has sufficient evidence in the form of documentation that the blendstocks were:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Exported;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Used for other than gasoline blending purposes;</textblock>
    <textblock>(iii) Transferred to a refiner that used the blendstock as a ``feedstock'' in a refining process during which the blendstock underwent a substantial chemical or physical transformation; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(iv) Transferred between refineries which have been grouped pursuant to ยง80.101(h) by a refiner for the purpose of determining compliance under this subpart.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e)(1) Any refiner or importer shall have exceeded the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change threshold if:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) The peak year blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change calculated under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section is more than ten; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Beginning on January 1, 1998, the cumulative blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change calculated under paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section is more than ten.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) Any refiner or importer that exceeds the blendstock-to-gasoline ratio percentage change threshold shall, without further notification:</textblock>
    <textblock>(i) Include all blendstocks produced or imported and transferred to others in its compliance calculations for two averaging periods beginning on January 1 of the averaging period subsequent to the averaging period when the exceedance occurs;</textblock>
    <textblock>(ii) Provide transfer documents to the recipient of such blendstock that contain the language specified at ยง80. 106(b); and</textblock>
