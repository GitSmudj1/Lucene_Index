    <textblock>(1) The model given in</textblock>
    <textblock>paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section shall be used as</textblock>
    <textblock>given to determine VOC and toxics emissions, respectively,</textblock>
    <textblock>if the properties of the fuel being evaluated fall within</textblock>
    <textblock>the ranges shown in this paragraph (c). If the properties</textblock>
    <textblock>of the fuel being evaluated fall outside the range shown in</textblock>
    <textblock>this paragraph (c), the model may not be used to determine</textblock>
    <textblock>the VOC or toxics performance of the fuel:</textblock>
