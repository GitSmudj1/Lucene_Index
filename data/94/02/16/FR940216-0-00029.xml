    <textblock>Trawl vessels carrying observers for purposes of complying with the Observer Plan are subject to the Vessel Incentive Program. The program encourages trawl fishermen to avoid high halibut bycatch rates while conducting groundfish fisheries by specifying bycatch rate standards for various target fisheries.</textblock>
    <textblock>Current regulations require groundfish pots to have halibut exclusion devices to reduce halibut bycatches. Resulting low bycatch and mortality rates of halibut in pot fisheries have justified exempting pot gear from PSC limits. Because halibut bycatch mortality in the pot fisheries is so low, and not expected to increase during 1994, the Council has again recommended exempting these fisheries from halibut bycatch restrictions in 1994, as it did in 1993. A recent change in the definition of pelagic trawl gear is intended to reduce bycatch of halibut by displacing fishing effort off the bottom of the sea floor when certain halibut bycatch levels are reached during the fishing year. The definition provides standards for physical conformation and also for performance of the trawl gear in terms of crab bycatch (58 FR 39680, July 26, 1993). A recent regulatory change required all hook-and-line vessel operators to employ careful release measures when handling halibut bycatch (58 FR 28799, May 17, 1993). This measure is intended to reduce handling mortality, increase the amount of groundfish harvested with the available halibut mortality limits, and possibly lower overall halibut mortality in groundfish fisheries.</textblock>
    <textblock>Halibut bycatch will potentially be reduced by changes in some groundfish fishing seasons. The sablefish hook-and-line season starts May 18, and the rockfish trawl fishery is delayed until the third quarter, July 4. These delays postpone the start of the sablefish and rockfish fisheries to times when seasonal halibut bycatch rates are lower.</textblock>
    <textblock>Methods listed under (F) above, will be reviewed by NMFS and the Council to determine their effectiveness. Changes will be initiated as necessary in response to this review or to public testimony and comment, either through regulatory or FMP amendments.</textblock>
    <textblock>Consistent with the goals and objectives of the FMP to reduce halibut bycatches while providing an opportunity to harvest the groundfish OY, NMFS proposes the assignments of 2,000 mt and 750 mt of halibut PSC mortality limits to trawl and hook-and-line gear, respectively. While these limits will reduce the harvest quota for commercial halibut fishermen, NMFS has determined that they will not result in unfair allocation to any particular user group. NMFS recognizes that some halibut bycatch will occur in the groundfish fishery, but expansion of the Vessel Incentive Program, required modifications to gear and handling procedures, and delays to the start of the sablefish hook-and-line gear and rockfish trawl gear fisheries are intended to reduce adverse impacts on halibut fishermen while promoting the opportunity to achieve the OY from the groundfish fishery.</textblock>
    <textblock>10. Seasonal Allocations of the Halibut PSC Limits</textblock>
    <textblock>Under ยง672.20(f)(2), NMFS seasonally allocates the halibut PSC limits based on recommendations from the Council. The FMP requires that the following information be considered by the Council in recommending seasonal allocations of halibut (a) seasonal distribution of halibut, (b) seasonal distribution of target groundfish species relative to halibut distribution, (c) expected halibut bycatch needs on a seasonal basis relevant to changes in halibut biomass and expected catches of target groundfish species, (d) expected bycatch rates on a seasonal basis, (e) expected changes in directed groundfish fishing seasons, (f) expected actual start of fishing effort, and (g) economic effects of establishing seasonal halibut allocations on segments of the target groundfish industry. The Council recommended the same seasonal allowances of PSC limits for the 1994 fishing year as those in effect during the 1993 fishing year. The publication of the final 1993 initial groundfish and PSC specifications (58 FR 16787, March 31, 1993) summarizes Council findings with respect to each of the FMP considerations set forth above. At this time, the Council's findings are unchanged from those set forth in 1993. Pacific halibut PSC limits, and apportionments thereof, are presented in Table 6. Regulations specify that overages and shortfalls in PSC catches will be accounted for within the 1994 fishing year.</textblock>
    <textblock>Slight adjustments from the 1993 seasonal allocations are proposed to accommodate dates of anticipated fishing effort and the opening date of the hook-and-line directed fishery for sablefish</textblock>
    <textblock>(May 18, 1994). Trawling for rockfish species will start on July 4, 1994 in accordance with ยง672.23(d).</textblock>
