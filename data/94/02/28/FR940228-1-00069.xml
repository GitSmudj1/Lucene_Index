    <textblock>Undergraduate Student</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to add a definition of</textblock>
    <textblock>undergraduate</textblock>
    <textblock>student</textblock>
    <textblock>to this section. Because the proposed definition of a</textblock>
    <textblock>full-time student</textblock>
    <textblock>makes reference to an</textblock>
    <textblock>undergraduate student</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>because the term</textblock>
    <textblock>undergraduate student</textblock>
    <textblock>is used in other places in</textblock>
    <textblock>part 668, the Secretary believes it is now necessary to define</textblock>
    <textblock>undergraduate student</textblock>
    <textblock>in this part. The proposed definition is</textblock>
    <textblock>the definition currently found in the Federal Pell Grant and</textblock>
    <textblock>campus-based program regulations. The Secretary proposes to</textblock>
    <textblock>define an</textblock>
    <textblock>undergraduate student</textblock>
    <textblock>as a student enrolled in an</textblock>
    <textblock>undergraduate educational program at an institution who has not</textblock>
    <textblock>earned a baccalaureate or first professional degree. The student</textblock>
    <textblock>would have to be enrolled in an undergraduate educational program</textblock>
    <textblock>that usually does not exceed 4 academic years, or a 4- to</textblock>
    <textblock>5-academic-year program designed to lead to a first degree. A</textblock>
    <textblock>student enrolled in a program of any other length would be</textblock>
    <textblock>considered an undergraduate student for only the first four</textblock>
    <textblock>academic years of that program.</textblock>
    <textblock>Section 668.8␣Eligible Program</textblock>
    <textblock>Admission Requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>These proposed regulations would remove the current</textblock>
    <textblock>provisions in §668.8(a)(1) (i) through (iv), which govern the</textblock>
    <textblock>educational qualifications of persons admitted into an eligible</textblock>
    <textblock>program. These qualifications are appropriately addressed in</textblock>
    <textblock>34 CFR 600.4 through 600.6, which govern the types of</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions that may be eligible to apply to participate in HEA</textblock>
    <textblock>programs. The educational qualifications of eligible students</textblock>
    <textblock>under the Title IV, HEA programs are also addressed in</textblock>
    <textblock>§668.7(a) (3) and (b). Therefore, these provisions are no longer</textblock>
    <textblock>needed for purposes of defining an eligible program. Note that</textblock>
    <textblock>other provisions governing the admission requirements needed for</textblock>
    <textblock>certain educational programs to qualify as an eligible program</textblock>
    <textblock>are discussed further below.</textblock>
    <textblock>Definitions</textblock>
    <textblock>These regulations would clarify a number of the terms used</textblock>
    <textblock>to determine an eligible program. Proposed §668.8(b)(1) would</textblock>
    <textblock>define the</textblock>
    <textblock>equivalent of an associate degree</textblock>
    <textblock>as either an</textblock>
    <textblock>associate degree, or the successful completion of at least a</textblock>
    <textblock>two-year program that is acceptable for full credit toward a</textblock>
    <textblock>bachelor's degree and qualifies a student for admission into the</textblock>
    <textblock>third year of a bachelor's degree program. This definition is</textblock>
    <textblock>needed because educational programs offered by a proprietary</textblock>
    <textblock>institution of higher education or a postsecondary vocational</textblock>
    <textblock>institution may qualify as eligible programs depending, in part,</textblock>
    <textblock>on whether the programs admit students with the equivalent of an</textblock>
    <textblock>associate degree (see the discussion on minimum program lengths).</textblock>
    <textblock>The definition is based on the provision in section 1201(a)(3) of</textblock>
    <textblock>the HEA that qualifies institutions offering 2-year transfer</textblock>
    <textblock>programs for institutional eligibility.</textblock>
    <textblock>For the same reason (that the terms are needed to establish</textblock>
    <textblock>the eligibility of programs offered by proprietary institutions</textblock>
    <textblock>of higher education and postsecondary vocational institutions_</textblock>
    <textblock>see the discussion on minimum program lengths) the Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>proposes to define</textblock>
    <textblock>week</textblock>
    <textblock>and</textblock>
    <textblock>week of instruction.</textblock>
    <textblock>For</textblock>
    <textblock>consistency, these terms would be the same as those proposed to</textblock>
    <textblock>be used in §668.2 for the definition of</textblock>
    <textblock>academic year.</textblock>
    <textblock>The terms</textblock>
    <textblock>are discussed in detail there.</textblock>
    <textblock>It is important to note that short-term programs (those</textblock>
    <textblock>offering less than 600 clock hours) that are eligible under</textblock>
    <textblock>current regulations because they met the definition of</textblock>
    <textblock>vocational</textblock>
    <textblock>school</textblock>
    <textblock>that used to be in section 435 of the HEA, will cease to</textblock>
    <textblock>be eligible when the final regulations governing programs become</textblock>
    <textblock>effective, unless those short-term programs are able to satisfy</textblock>
    <textblock>these regulations. Short-term programs that were not offered or</textblock>
    <textblock>were not eligible before July 23, 1992 can only become eligible</textblock>
    <textblock>when final regulations become effective.</textblock>
