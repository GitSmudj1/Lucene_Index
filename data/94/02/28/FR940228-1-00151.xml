    <textblock>(X)</textblock>
    <textblock>The institution must advise students that any</textblock>
    <textblock>notifications of withdrawal or cancellation and requests for</textblock>
    <textblock>refund must be in writing and addressed to the designated</textblock>
    <textblock>institution officer.</textblock>
    <textblock>A student's written notification of</textblock>
    <textblock>withdrawal or cancellation and request for a refund provides an</textblock>
    <textblock>accurate record of transactions and also ensures that the request</textblock>
    <textblock>will be processed on a timely basis. Acceptance of oral requests</textblock>
    <textblock>is an undesirable practice.</textblock>
    <textblock>(XI)</textblock>
    <textblock>The institution must pay or credit refunds due in</textblock>
    <textblock>accordance with ยง668.22(h)(4).</textblock>
    <textblock>(XII) The institution must publicize, as a part of its</textblock>
    <textblock>dissemination of information on charges and refunds, that an</textblock>
    <textblock>appeals process exists for students or parents who believe that</textblock>
    <textblock>individual circumstances warrant exceptions from published</textblock>
    <textblock>policy. The informational materials must include the name,</textblock>
    <textblock>title, and address of the official responsible for handling</textblock>
    <textblock>appeals.</textblock>
    <textblock>Although charges and refund policies should reflect</textblock>
    <textblock>extensive consideration of student and institutional needs, it</textblock>
    <textblock>will not be possible to encompass in these structures the variety</textblock>
    <textblock>of personal circumstances that may exist or develop.</textblock>
    <textblock>Institutions are required to provide a system of due process to</textblock>
    <textblock>their students, and charges and refund policies are legitimately</textblock>
    <textblock>a part of that process. Students and parents should be informed</textblock>
    <textblock>regularly of procedures for requesting information concerning</textblock>
    <textblock>exceptions to published policies.</textblock>
    <textblock>PART 690_FEDERAL PELL GRANT PROGRAM</textblock>
    <textblock>17. The heading for part 690 is revised to read as set forth above.</textblock>
    <textblock>18. The authority citation for part 690 continues to read as</textblock>
    <textblock>follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Authority:</textblock>
    <textblock>20 U.S.C. 1070a through 1070a-6, unless otherwise</textblock>
    <textblock>noted.</textblock>
    <textblock>19. Section 690.83 is amended by adding a new paragraph (e)</textblock>
    <textblock>to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>ยง690.83</textblock>
    <textblock>Submission of reports.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(e) (1) Notwithstanding paragraphs (a), (b), (c) (1) or (2),</textblock>
    <textblock>or (d) of this section, if an institution demonstrates to the</textblock>
    <textblock>satisfaction of the Secretary that the institution has provided</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Pell Grants in accordance with this part but has not</textblock>
    <textblock>received credit or payment for those grants, the institution may</textblock>
    <textblock>receive payment or a reduction in accountability for those grants</textblock>
    <textblock>in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The institution must demonstrate that it qualifies for</textblock>
    <textblock>a credit or payment by means of a finding contained in an audit</textblock>
    <textblock>report as initially submitted to the Department that was</textblock>
    <textblock>conducted after December 31, 1988 and timely submitted in</textblock>
    <textblock>accordance with 34 CFR 668.23(c), with respect to grants made</textblock>
    <textblock>during the period of that audit.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3) In determining whether the institution qualifies for a</textblock>
    <textblock>payment or reduction in accountability, the Secretary takes into</textblock>
    <textblock>account any liabilities of the institution arising from that</textblock>
    <textblock>audit or any other source. The Secretary collects those</textblock>
    <textblock>liabilities by offset in accordance with 34 CFR part 30.</textblock>
    <textblock>* * * * *</textblock>
    <textblock>(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 1070a, 1094, 1226a-1)</textblock>
