    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to make explicit that record-keeping</textblock>
    <textblock>is a basic standard of administrative capability. Those new</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions that do not have adequate record-keeping capability</textblock>
    <textblock>would not be approved to participate in the Title IV, HEA</textblock>
    <textblock>programs. The record-keeping capability of participating</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions would be evaluated when the institutions seek</textblock>
    <textblock>renewal of their program participation.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to revise the satisfactory progress</textblock>
    <textblock>standards to require that the maximum time frame for completion</textblock>
    <textblock>of an undergraduate program be no longer than 150 percent of the</textblock>
    <textblock>published length of the educational program and that increments</textblock>
    <textblock>of the maximum time frame not exceed the lesser of one academic</textblock>
    <textblock>year or one-half the published length of the educational program.</textblock>
    <textblock>The establishment of the maximum time frame must, as usual, take</textblock>
    <textblock>into account a student's enrollment status. Thus, an institution</textblock>
    <textblock>that offers a four-year degree program (as listed in the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution's catalog) would have to establish a maximum time</textblock>
    <textblock>frame of no more than six years for completion of the program by</textblock>
    <textblock>a full-time student. The time frame could be proportionally</textblock>
    <textblock>longer for a half-time student. The Secretary emphasizes that</textblock>
    <textblock>this requirement would set an upper limit on the period of time</textblock>
    <textblock>for which a student may receive Title IV, HEA program aid. An</textblock>
    <textblock>institution would not be required to expel or otherwise remove a</textblock>
    <textblock>student from the educational program after the expiration of this</textblock>
    <textblock>maximum time frame (unless, of course, the institution has a</textblock>
    <textblock>similar requirement for students who do not receive Title IV, HEA</textblock>
    <textblock>program assistance). The Secretary has a longstanding policy</textblock>
    <textblock>under which 150 percent of the length of an educational program</textblock>
    <textblock>is considered to be a reasonable period in which a serious</textblock>
    <textblock>student should be able to complete the program. The Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>notes that this proposed time frame is also consistent with</textblock>
    <textblock>proposals made by the NPRM implementing the Student Right-to-Know</textblock>
    <textblock>provisions in section 485(a) of the HEA (57 FR 30826). The</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary does not believe that Title IV, HEA program aid should</textblock>
    <textblock>be provided beyond the point at which a student can reasonably be</textblock>
    <textblock>expected to complete his or her educational objective.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to expand and clarify the</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements for reporting information about possible fraud or</textblock>
    <textblock>illegal misconduct related to the Title IV, HEA programs. The</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed regulations would eliminate the current provision for an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution to refer suspected instances of fraud or other</textblock>
    <textblock>criminal misconduct involving Title IV, HEA program assistance to</textblock>
    <textblock>a State or local law enforcement agency rather than the Office of</textblock>
    <textblock>Inspector General (OIG), if more appropriate. Instead, the</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed regulations would require the institution to notify only</textblock>
    <textblock>the OIG. The proposed regulations would also remove a related</textblock>
    <textblock>requirement_that the institution report to the OIG, for each</textblock>
    <textblock>calendar year, all relevant referrals to State or local law</textblock>
    <textblock>enforcement agencies, as this would no longer be necessary if all</textblock>
    <textblock>referrals were made directly to the OIG. Upon receipt of the</textblock>
    <textblock>information, the OIG will notify and work with the appropriate</textblock>
    <textblock>officials to resolve the issue. The Secretary is proposing to</textblock>
    <textblock>amend this section to streamline the referral process and reduce</textblock>
    <textblock>the burden of reporting information.</textblock>
    <textblock>Currently, under this provision governing the reporting of</textblock>
    <textblock>instances of suspected fraud and criminal misconduct,</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions are required to report only information regarding</textblock>
    <textblock>applicants for Title IV, HEA program assistance. Another</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed change would expand the reporting requirement with</textblock>
    <textblock>respect to both the types of misconduct to be reported and the</textblock>
    <textblock>individuals and entities involved in the misconduct. In addition</textblock>
    <textblock>to the information currently required, an institution would be</textblock>
    <textblock>required to report information regarding illegal conduct</textblock>
    <textblock>involving the eligibility and funding of the institution and its</textblock>
    <textblock>students through Title IV, HEA programs believed by the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution to have been committed by any employee, third-party</textblock>
    <textblock>servicer, or other agent of the institution that acts in a</textblock>
    <textblock>capacity that involves the administration of the Title IV, HEA</textblock>
    <textblock>programs. This provision would specify that illegal conduct</textblock>
    <textblock>would include possible fraud, misrepresentation, conversion or</textblock>
    <textblock>breach of fiduciary responsibility, or any other illegal conduct.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary believes it is important to investigate any</textblock>
    <textblock>possible illegal misconduct (i.e., misconduct where formal</textblock>
    <textblock>criminal charges have not been brought) in addition to possible</textblock>
    <textblock>criminal misconduct. The intent of this expansion is to specify</textblock>
    <textblock>that institutions should report not only acts that constitute</textblock>
    <textblock>fraud or criminal conduct, but any and all other illegal conduct</textblock>
    <textblock>involving Title IV, HEA programs in which an employee or</textblock>
    <textblock>third-party servicer might have engaged.</textblock>
