    <textblock>Practical to replant_</textblock>
    <textblock>(subsection 1.(ff) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8) does not apply to small grains.) Our determination, after loss or damage to the insured crop, based on factors, including but not limited to moisture availability, condition of the field, time to crop maturity, etc., that a replanting of the insured crop will attain maturity in the remainder of the crop year. It will not be considered practical to replant after the end of the late planting period or the final planting date if a late planting period is not applicable (see section 7) except that it may be determined practical to replant after the end of the late planting period or the final plant date if such procedure is generally occurring in the area.</textblock>
    <textblock>(p)</textblock>
    <textblock>Prevented planting_</textblock>
    <textblock>Inabiltiy to plant the insured crop with proper equipment by:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The latest final planting date for the insured crop in the county; or</textblock>
    <textblock>(2) The end of the late planting period.</textblock>
    <textblock>You must have been unable to plant the insured crop due to an insured cause of loss that is general in the area (i.e., most producers in the surrounding area are unable to plant due to similar insurable causes) and that occurs between the sales closing date and the latest final planting date for the insured crop in the county or within the late planting period.</textblock>
    <textblock>(q)</textblock>
    <textblock>Production guarantee_</textblock>
    <textblock>The number of bushels determined by multiplying the approved yield per acre by the coverage level percentage you elect.</textblock>
    <textblock>(r)</textblock>
    <textblock>Replanting_</textblock>
    <textblock>Performing the cultural practices necessary to replace seed for the insured crop, and replacing the seed in the insured acreage with the expectation of growing a successful crop.</textblock>
    <textblock>(s)</textblock>
    <textblock>Small grains_</textblock>
    <textblock>Wheat, barley, oats, rye, and flax.</textblock>
    <textblock>(t)</textblock>
    <textblock>Swathed_</textblock>
    <textblock>Severance of the stem and grain head from the ground without removal of the seed from the head and placing into a windrow.</textblock>
    <textblock>(u)</textblock>
    <textblock>Timely planted_</textblock>
    <textblock>Planted on or before the final planting date designated in the Special Provisions.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Unit Division</textblock>
    <textblock>Unless limited by the Special Provisions, a unit as defined in subsection 1.(tt) of the Common Crop Insurance policy (ยง457.8) may be divided into optional units if, for each optional unit you claim, all the conditions of subsections 2.(a), (b), and (c), and the conditions of paragraph 2.(d)(1), (d)(2, or (d)(3) are met, or if we agree to such division in writing. Optional units must be established at the time you file your report of acreage for each crop year.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) You must have verifiable records of planted acreage and production for each optional unit for at least the last crop year used to determine your production guarantee.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) You must plant the crop in a manner which results in a clear and discernable break in the planting pattern at the boundaries of each optional unit.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) You must have measurements of stored production or market production from each optional unit in a manner that permits us to verify the production from the optional unit.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Each optional unit must meet one or more of the following:</textblock>
    <textblock>(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Optional Units by Section, Section Equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number:</textblock>
    <textblock>Optional units may be established if each optional unit is located in a separate section. In the absence of sections, we may consider parcels of land legally identified by other methods of measure including, but not limited to: Spanish grants, railroad surveys, leagues, labors, or Virginia Military Lands. In areas which have not been surveyed using the systems identified above or another system approved by us, and in areas where boundaries are not readily discernable, each optional unit must be located in separate ASCS Farm Serial Number.</textblock>
    <textblock>(2)</textblock>
    <textblock>Optional Units on Acreage Including Both Irrigated and Non-Irrigated Practices:</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition to or instead of establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number, optional units may be established if each optional unit contains only irrigated acreage or only non-irrigated acreage. The irrigated acreage may not extend beyond the point at which your irrigation system can deliver the quantity of water needed to produce the yield on which your guarantee is based. You must plant, cultivate, fertilize, or otherwise care for the irrigated acreage and the non-irrigated acreage in an appropriate manner.</textblock>
    <textblock>(3)</textblock>
    <textblock>Optional Units by Initially Planted Winter Wheat or Initially Planted Spring Wheat:</textblock>
    <textblock>For wheat only, in addition to or instead of establishing optional units by section, section equivalent, or ASCS Farm Serial Number as described in paragraph 2.(d)(1) or by irrigated and non-irrigated practices as described in paragraph 2.(d)(2), optional units maybe established if each optional unit contains only initially planted winter wheat or only initially planted spring wheat. Optional units may be established in this manner only in counties having both fall and spring final planting dates as designated by the Special Provisions.</textblock>
    <textblock>Basic units may not be divided into optional units on any basis (production practice, type, variety, planting period, etc.) other than as described under this section. If you do not comply fully with these conditions, we will combine all optional units which are not established in compliance with these provisions into the basic unit from which they were formed. We may do this at any time we discover that you have failed to comply with these conditions. If failure to comply with these provisions is determined to be inadvertent, and if the optional units are combined, the premium paid for electing optional units will be refunded to you.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition to the requirements under section 3 (Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for determining Indemnities) of the Common Crop Insurance Policy (ยง457.8) you may select only one price election for each crop insured under this policy in the county.</textblock>
