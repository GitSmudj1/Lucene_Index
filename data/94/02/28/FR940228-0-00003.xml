    <textblock>Executive Order 12866 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>The action allows the importation of apples, apricots, grapefruit, oranges, peaches, persimmons, pomegranates, and tangerines from San Luis Rio Colorado into the United States without treatment for the five listed insect pests. This action could increase imports of these articles into the United States, since import costs will be lowered through the elimination of treatment costs. The small entities that could be affected by this action include fumigators at the Mexican border, importers of the above-listed fruits, and domestic growers, distributors, and retailers of these fruits.</textblock>
    <textblock>The economic impact on these entities should be insignificant since the amount of fruit imported into the United States from San Luis Rio Colorado is expected to be very small.</textblock>
    <textblock>Based on available information, we anticipate that only imports of oranges, peaches, and possibly grapefruit may increase as a result of this rule. Further, if imports of oranges and peaches from Sonora and imports of grapefruit from Mexico in general were to increase 10 percent from 1992 levels, this increase would amount to less than one percent of total U.S. production and less than one percent of total U.S. imports of these commodities. Consequently, we do not estimate any changes in prices or costs of fresh oranges, peaches, or grapefruit as a result of this rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that this action will not have a</textblock>
    <textblock>significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Order 12778</textblock>
    <textblock>This rule allows fruit to be imported into the United States from San Luis Rio Colorado, Mexico. State and local laws and regulations regarding fruit imported under this rule will be preempted while the fruit is in foreign commerce. Fresh fruits are generally imported for immediate distribution and sale to the consuming public, and will remain in foreign commerce until sold to the ultimate consumer. The question of when foreign commerce ceases in other cases must be addressed on a case-by-case basis. No retroactive effect will be given to this rule, and this rule will not require administrative proceedings before parties may file suit in court challenging this rule.</textblock>
