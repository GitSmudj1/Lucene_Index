    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Forest Service will prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) to document the analysis and disclose the environmental impacts of proposed actions to salvage harvest timber and improve productivity of stands of trees in portions of the Muddy Creek, Twelvemile Creek, Sixmile Creek, and Ferron Creek Drainages. The project is located approximately 10 air miles southeast of Manti, Utah.</textblock>
    <textblock>The entire proposal area involves some 30,000 acres of which approximately 10,000 acres is forested with an Engelmann spruce cover type. A bark beetle epidemic has affected the major portion of this type. the need for the proposal is established by the silvicultural condition of the affected timber stands and forest goals as outlined in the Manti-La Sal National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan.</textblock>
    <textblock>Six areas that were inventoried as roadless as part of the RARE II evaluation are adjacent to and in some cases overlap the proposal. These areas were released back to full Multiple Use management by the Utah Wilderness Act and were evaluated for a variety of designations in the Forest's analysis during the Forest Land and Resource Plan process which was completed in 1986. The current analysis will document effects that would substantially alter the undeveloped character of these areas.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>This EIS will tier to the final EIS for the Manti-La Sal National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan (Forest Plan). The Manti-La Sal Forest Plan provides the overall guidance (Goals, Objectives, Standards, and Management Area Direction) to achieve the Desired Future Condition for the area being analyzed, and contains specific management area prescriptions for the entire Forest.</textblock>
    <textblock>A National forest Management Act Analysis for this proposal was completed in 1993. As a result of that analysis and additional scoping the Manti-La Sal concluded the proposal may have a significant effect on the roadless character of some of the surrounding areas, and because of the scope of the project size it was decided to prepare this EIS. The previous scoping and analysis also identified the following potential issues related to the proposed action:</textblock>
    <textblock>What will be the effects of the proposal on the habitats, behavior, and local population of certain wildlife species?</textblock>
    <textblock>What effect will the proposed activities have on the access, quality, and safety of the recreational opportunities of the area?</textblock>
    <textblock>How will the proposal alter the present visual quality?</textblock>
    <textblock>What will be the effects of the proposal on cultural resources?</textblock>
    <textblock>How will potential build up of dead, down, woody, ground fuels be effected by the proposal?</textblock>
    <textblock>How will the proposal contribute to a healthy, productive forest that will economically provide timber for the market place on a sustainable basis for the present and the future?</textblock>
    <textblock>What effect will the proposal have on the transportation systems presently serving the area?</textblock>
