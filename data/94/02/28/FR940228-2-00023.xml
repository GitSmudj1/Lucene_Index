    <textblock>The Department preliminarily determines that since the instant forgings appear dedicated to the production of TRBs, these forgings are essentially parts of TRBs. Therefore, the ultimate use criterion indicates that these forgings are within the scope of the order.</textblock>
    <textblock>Conclusion</textblock>
    <textblock>Based on our analysis of the comments provided by interested parties on the language of the petition and the determinations of the ITC and the Department, and on the physical characteristics, channels of trade, expectations of the ultimate purchasers, and the ultimate use of the product, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(i), we preliminarily determine that such forgings are the same class or kind of merchandise as unfinished TRB parts, and therefore are within the scope of the order on tapered roller bearings and parts thereof from Japan. The Department preliminarily determines these forgings to be within the scope based on the totality of the facts presented above and especially for the following reasons: (1) the ITC clearly includes precursor materials such as forgings within its definition of like product; (2) the physical characteristics, channels of trade, ultimate use of forgings, and expectations of ultimate purchasers indicate that such forgings are within the scope of the order.</textblock>
    <textblock>We invite interested parties to comment on this preliminary determination no later than March 18, 1994. Rebuttal comments are due no later than March 25, 1994. The Department will consider such comments in reaching its final determination.</textblock>
    <textblock>This preliminary scope ruling is in accordance with 19 CFR 353.29(d)(3).</textblock>
