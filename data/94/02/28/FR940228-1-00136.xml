    <textblock>working days, if the institution submitted that request within 10</textblock>
    <textblock>working days from the date on which the institution received</textblock>
    <textblock>notification from the Secretary that its cohort default rate</textblock>
    <textblock>exceeds the thresholds specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this</textblock>
    <textblock>section, and the institution simultaneously submitted a copy of</textblock>

    <textblock>When the institution receives the guaranty agency's response, to</textblock>
    <textblock>complete its appeal, the institution must submit the verified</textblock>
    <textblock>data to the Secretary's designated Department official within</textblock>
    <textblock>five working days in order to continue participating in the FFEL</textblock>
    <textblock>programs until the Secretary issues a decision on the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution's appeal.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d)</textblock>
    <textblock>Appeal procedures.</textblock>

    <textblock>later than 30 days after it receives notification of its loss of</textblock>
    <textblock>participation. The institution may appeal on the grounds that_</textblock>
    <textblock>(i)(A) The calculation of the institution's cohort default</textblock>
    <textblock>rate for any of the three fiscal years relevant to the end of</textblock>
    <textblock>participation is not accurate; and</textblock>
    <textblock>(B) A recalculation with corrected data verified by the</textblock>
    <textblock>cognizant guaranty agency or agencies would produce a cohort</textblock>
    <textblock>default rate for any of those fiscal years that is below the</textblock>
    <textblock>threshold percentage specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this</textblock>
