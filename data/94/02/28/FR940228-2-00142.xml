    <textblock>The goal of the Eisenhower National Program is to support projects of national significance in elementary and secondary schools in mathematics and science education designed to improve the skills of teachers and the quality of instruction in these areas and to increase the access of students to that instruction. The program is authorized under title II, part A, subpart 1, section 2012 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, as amended.</textblock>
    <textblock>On November 12, 1993, the Secretary announced in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>(58 FR 60007) a proposed priority for the Eisenhower National Program in model professional development in the use of technology for mathematics and science instruction. Now, after considering the intent of the Senate Report that accompanied the Fiscal Year 1994 Department of Education Appropriations Act, the Secretary has decided to propose two additional priorities, announced herein. These priorities will serve (1) to encourage the interest and attainments of female and minority students in mathematics and science and (2) to improve teacher professional development in environmental education.</textblock>
