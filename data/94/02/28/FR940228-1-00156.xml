    <textblock>•An institution should not be obligated to enter into an</textblock>
    <textblock>agreement with a student who wants to study abroad.</textblock>
    <textblock>[New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>3. How should the term ``approved for credit'' be defined?</textblock>
    <textblock>•The term ``approved for credit'' should mean that credits</textblock>
    <textblock>are fully transferable (accepted for credit) into an</textblock>
    <textblock>eligible program offered by the home institution.</textblock>
    <textblock>[Kansas City]</textblock>
    <textblock>•``Approved for credit'' should mean used toward a degree</textblock>
    <textblock>as defined by the institution. [San Francisco]</textblock>
    <textblock>•``Approved for credit'' should mean that it is determined</textblock>
    <textblock>in advance that the credit is accepted at the home</textblock>
    <textblock>institution. [Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>4. Should a standard format be developed for institutions to</textblock>
    <textblock>report study abroad programs?</textblock>
    <textblock>•A standard format for institutions to report study</textblock>
    <textblock>abroad programs is not needed. It does not appear that</textblock>
    <textblock>any reporting is required. [Kansas City, New York,</textblock>
    <textblock>San Francisco, Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>D. Section 487(a)(14)(A) requires a new institution or an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution that undergoes a change of ownership or changes its</textblock>
    <textblock>status as a parent or subordinate institution to develop a</textblock>
    <textblock>Default Management Plan to participate in the FFEL program. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary must approve the plan and the plan must be implemented</textblock>
    <textblock>for two years after the institution is initially certified as an</textblock>
    <textblock>eligible institution or for two years after its change of</textblock>
    <textblock>ownership or status.</textblock>
    <textblock>Issues that the community was asked to address and the</textblock>
    <textblock>community's views:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Should the criteria in Appendix D of current regulations be</textblock>
    <textblock>used as the basis for the Secretary's approval of default plans?</textblock>
    <textblock>•Unless otherwise required, an institution should use</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix D or submit any other approved default</textblock>
    <textblock>management plan. [Kansas City, Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>•If a new institution uses Appendix D, it is subject to</textblock>
    <textblock>things it can't do as a new institution. What is in</textblock>
    <textblock>Appendix D that isn't in the new regulations already?</textblock>
    <textblock>New institutions will certify that they will adopt the</textblock>
    <textblock>stipulated plan they have in place (that has approval</textblock>
    <textblock>from the appropriate State and or accrediting body.)</textblock>
    <textblock>[New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Should there be other criteria?</textblock>
    <textblock>•Other criteria should include: a) more follow up once</textblock>
    <textblock>the student leaves the institution; and b) additional</textblock>
    <textblock>cooperation with all partners in the program, i.e.,</textblock>
    <textblock>lenders, institutions, and secondary markets. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Department should reassess the method for determining</textblock>
    <textblock>cohort default rate. It is not fair for most</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions. [San Francisco]</textblock>
    <textblock>•No other criteria is needed. [Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>E. Section 487(a)(18)(A) requires an institution that offers</textblock>
    <textblock>athletically-related student aid to compile annually data on</textblock>
    <textblock>expenses and revenues of athletic activities and expenses and</textblock>
    <textblock>revenues of the institution.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. How should the terms ``revenues'' and ``expenses'' be defined?</textblock>
    <textblock>•There should be coordination with NCAA regulations and</textblock>
    <textblock>audit guides. [San Francisco]</textblock>
    <textblock>•Institutions should be allowed to use the accounting</textblock>
    <textblock>principles and terms they are currently using to define</textblock>
    <textblock>``revenues'' and ``expenses.'' [Kansas City]</textblock>
    <textblock>F. Section 487(a)(19) provides that if a student is unable to</textblock>
    <textblock>meet his or her financial obligation to the institution because</textblock>
    <textblock>of a delay in the disbursement of proceeds of a Title IV, HEA</textblock>
    <textblock>program loan (due to compliance with Title IV requirements or</textblock>
    <textblock>delays attributable to the institution), the institution may not</textblock>
    <textblock>penalize the student in any way, including assessing a late fee;</textblock>
    <textblock>denying the student access to class, the library, or other</textblock>
    <textblock>facilities; or requiring that the student borrow additional</textblock>
    <textblock>funds.</textblock>
    <textblock>1. How should the term ``denial of access to classes'' be</textblock>
    <textblock>interpreted?</textblock>
    <textblock>•``Denial of access'' should mean the student is not given</textblock>
    <textblock>access to equipment or supplies. [San Francisco]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. What should be considered as a condition to meet the</textblock>
    <textblock>definition of a ``delay in the delivery of proceeds?''</textblock>
