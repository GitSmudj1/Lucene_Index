  <text>
    <textblock>Due to differences in legal and reporting entity, mission,</textblock>
    <textblock>and accounting format for nonprofit entities and for</textblock>
    <textblock>profit-seeking entities, there are differing tests of financial</textblock>
    <textblock>responsibility to be applied. Evaluating a nonprofit entity's</textblock>
    <textblock>overall financial condition is more complicated because there is</textblock>
    <textblock>no commonly accepted standard of acceptable financial condition.</textblock>
    <textblock>Generally, a measure of an institution's financial condition is a</textblock>
    <textblock>measure of an institution's solvency, or the ability of an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution to adequately cover its expenditures with revenues.</textblock>
    <textblock>In determining an institution's financial condition, the</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary believes it is necessary to look at the institution's</textblock>
    <textblock>short-term solvency and long-term solvency, which is the ability</textblock>
    <textblock>of an institution to support an adequate level of services over</textblock>
    <textblock>the long run, withstanding economic disruption and meeting</textblock>
    <textblock>changing demands for services.</textblock>
    <textblock>With accounting for for-profit entities, analysis of</textblock>
    <textblock>financial statements provides an understanding of an institution's</textblock>
    <textblock>financial condition through comparisons of key financial ratios</textblock>
    <textblock>that measure the institution's ability to remain solvent while</textblock>
    <textblock>continuing to provide educational services at acceptable levels.</textblock>
    <textblock>Examination of financial information from nonprofit entities</textblock>
    <textblock>requires a review of other organizational factors that measure</textblock>
    <textblock>the ability of the institution to provide educational services</textblock>
    <textblock>using a larger and more complex source of funds. It is therefore</textblock>
    <textblock>necessary to differentiate the standards that are applicable to</textblock>
    <textblock>profit-seeking entities from the standards that are applicable to</textblock>
    <textblock>nonprofit entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary will first address the specific standards for</textblock>
    <textblock>for-profit institutions.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to require that a for-profit</textblock>
    <textblock>institution have, at the end of its latest fiscal year, a ratio</textblock>
    <textblock>of current assets to current liabilities of at least 1.25:1. One</textblock>
    <textblock>commonly used means of determining whether or not the institution</textblock>
    <textblock>has sufficient short-term solvency is use of the ratio of current</textblock>
    <textblock>assets to current liabilities. For the past fourteen years the</textblock>
    <textblock>Department has used a current assets to current liabilities ratio</textblock>
    <textblock>of at least 1:1 as an indicator of financial responsibility.</textblock>
    <textblock>This means that the institution has current assets at least equal</textblock>
    <textblock>to their current liabilities. In theory, this would indicate</textblock>
    <textblock>that an institution has sufficient resources to handle not only</textblock>
    <textblock>debt service, but also other liabilities for at least the coming</textblock>
    <textblock>fiscal year. The higher the amount of assets, the better the</textblock>
    <textblock>liquidity position of the institution and, therefore, the better</textblock>
    <textblock>the institution will be able to handle unforeseen economic</textblock>
    <textblock>conditions. The Secretary believes that the current 1:1</textblock>
    <textblock>benchmark offers little or no indication of adequate short-term</textblock>
    <textblock>solvency. A 1.25:1 benchmark has, therefore, been proposed for</textblock>
    <textblock>for-profit institutions. Cash is now required to be a component.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary believes that the proposed increase in current</textblock>
    <textblock>assets will help to ensure that institutions have sufficient</textblock>
    <textblock>resources to provide worthwhile education and training.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary is proposing a higher ratio of current assets</textblock>
    <textblock>to current liabilities ratio for for-profit institutions than for</textblock>
    <textblock>nonprofit institutions. The Secretary believes that a higher</textblock>
    <textblock>current ratio is necessary for for-profit institutions because</textblock>
    <textblock>they will be less likely, in the event of hampered liquidity, to</textblock>
    <textblock>draw on fund-raising as a source of cash. This rationale is</textblock>
    <textblock>discussed later as part of the discussion of the proposed ratio</textblock>
    <textblock>of current assets to current liabilities for nonprofit</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to exclude from the calculation of</textblock>
    <textblock>this ratio for for-profit institutions, uncollateralized loans</textblock>
    <textblock>receivable from owners and related parties. Uncollateralized</textblock>
    <textblock>related party loans are loans that have been made to affiliates,</textblock>
    <textblock>officers, or employees and have not been secured by tangible</textblock>
    <textblock>assets. In accordance with Accounting Research Bulletin 43</textblock>
    <textblock>(ARB43), chapter 3A, paragraph 6, the concept of current assets</textblock>
    <textblock>contemplates the exclusion from that classification of such</textblock>
    <textblock>resources as ``*␣*␣* (c) receivables arising from unusual</textblock>
    <textblock>transactions (such as the sale of capital assets, or loans or</textblock>
    <textblock>advances to affiliates, officers, or employees) that are not</textblock>
    <textblock>expected to be received within twelve (12) months''. In the event</textblock>
    <textblock>that certain financial statements present these types of loans on</textblock>
    <textblock>the balance sheet, they will be disregarded by the Secretary in</textblock>
    <textblock>computation of the current ratio.</textblock>
    <textblock>Further, because the proposed cash reserve requirement may</textblock>
    <textblock>cause a portion of the institution's cash reserves to be</textblock>
    <textblock>classified as a restricted asset, which would, under generally</textblock>
    <textblock>accepted accounting principles, be excluded from classification</textblock>
    <textblock>as current assets, the Secretary's proposal specifies that, for</textblock>
    <textblock>for-profit institutions, the cash reserves may be included in the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution's current assets in calculating the institution's</textblock>
    <textblock>current assets to current liabilities ratio. The Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>believes that it is appropriate to permit for-profit institutions</textblock>
    <textblock>to treat the cash reserves as current assets because the funds</textblock>
    <textblock>are held for the benefit of the students, and inclusion of those</textblock>
    <textblock>amounts toward demonstrating a 1.25:1 current ratio still leaves</textblock>
    <textblock>the institution with sufficient unrestricted assets to pay all</textblock>
    <textblock>current expenses.</textblock>
