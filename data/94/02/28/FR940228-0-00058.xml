    <textblock>731E_The use of the band 1610-1626.5 MHz by the mobile-satellite service (Earth-to-space) and by the radiodetermination-satellite service (Earth-to-space) is subject to the application of the coordination and notification procedures set forth in Resolution 46 (WARC-92). A mobile earth station operating in either of the services in this band shall not produce an e.i.r.p. density in excess of ^15 dB (W/4 kHz) in the part of the band used by systems operating in accordance with the provisions of No. 732, unless otherwise agreed by the affected administrations. In the part of the band where such systems are not operating, a value of ^3 dB (W/4 kHz) is applicable. Stations of the mobile-satellite service shall not cause harmful interference to, or claim protection from, stations in the aeronautical radionavigation service, stations operating in accordance with the provisions of No. 732 and stations in the fixed service operating in accordance with the provisions of No. 730.</textblock>
    <textblock>731F_The use of the band 1613.8-1626.5 MHz by the mobile-satellite service (space-to-Earth) is subject to the application of the coordination and notification procedures set forth in Resolution 46 (WARC-92).</textblock>

    <textblock>733E_Harmful interference shall not be caused to stations of the radio astronomy service using the band 1610.6-1613.8 MHz by stations of the radiodeterminaton-satellite and mobile-satellite services. (No. 2904 applies.)</textblock>
    <textblock>734_In making assignments to stations of other services, administrations are urged to take all practicable steps to protect the radio astronomy service in the band 1610.6-1613.8 MHz from harmful interference. Emissions from space or air-borne stations can be particularly serious sources of interference to the radio astronomy service (see Nos. 343 and 344 and Article 36).</textblock>

    <textblock>Different category of service:</textblock>
    <textblock>in France, the band 2450-2500 MHz is allocated on a primary basis to the radiolocation service (see No. 425). Such use is subject to agreement with administrations having service operating or planned to operate in accordance with the Table of Frequency Allocations which may be affected.</textblock>

    <textblock>753F_The use of the band 2483.5-2500 MHz by the mobile-satellite and the radiodetermination-satellite services is subject to the application of the coordination and notification procedures set forth in Resolution 46 (WARC-92). Coordination of space stations of the mobile-satellite and radiodetermination-satellite services with respect to terrestrial services is required only if the power flux-density produced at the Earth's surface exceeds the limits in No. 2566. In respect of assignments operating in this band, the provisions of Section II, paragraph 2.2 of Resolution 46 (WARC-92) shall also be applied to geostationary transmitting space stations with respect to terrestrial stations.</textblock>
