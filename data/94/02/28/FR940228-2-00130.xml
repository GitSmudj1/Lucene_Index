    <textblock>Vacant Unit</textblock>
    <textblock>means a dwelling unit that is not under an effective lease to an eligible family. An effective lease is a lease under which an eligible family has a right to possession of the unit and is being charged rent, even if the amount of any utility allowance equals or exceeds the amount of a total tenant payment that is based on income and, as a result, the amount paid by the family to the HA is zero.</textblock>

    <textblock>(1)</textblock>
    <textblock>Eligible Applicants.</textblock>
    <textblock>Funding for this program is limited to public and Indian housing authorities. The factors for award reflect that more than half of the points possible are for the provision of supportive services, whether provided by the HA or through partnerships with other social service agencies. Facilities assisted shall be on or near the premises of public or Indian housing. Two or more HAs may apply jointly if they demonstrate that it is feasible to run the program together; however, the maximum grant per application under this NOFA is $1,000,000.</textblock>
    <textblock>Although the program is intended to benefit public and Indian housing residents, an applicant that is otherwise eligible and is combining FIC activities with FSS activities may use FIC funds to serve both HA residents and section 8 families who are participating in the FSS Program. For all other families using FIC services, costs incurred are to be borne by other resources.</textblock>
    <textblock>To be eligible under this NOFA, a HA cannot have serious unaddressed, outstanding Inspector General audit findings or fair housing and equal opportunity monitoring review findings or Field Office management review findings. In addition, the HA must be in compliance with civil rights laws and equal opportunity requirements. A HA will be considered to be in compliance if:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) As a result of formal administrative proceedings, there are no outstanding findings of noncompliance with civil rights laws unless the HA is operating in compliance with HUD-approved compliance agreement designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance;</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) There is no adjudication of a civil rights violation in a civil action brought against it by a private individual, unless the HA demonstrates that it is operating in compliance with a court order, or implementing a HUD-approved resident selection and assignment plan or compliance agreement, designed to correct the area(s) of noncompliance;</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) There is no deferral of Federal funding based upon civil rights violations;</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) HUD has not deferred application processing by HUD under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Attorney General's Guidelines (28 CFR 50.3) and HUD's Title VI regulations (24 CFR 1.8) and procedures (HUD Handbook 8040.1) [PHAs only] or under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and HUD regulations (24 CFR 8.57) [PHAs and IHAs];</textblock>
    <textblock>(e) There is no pending civil rights suit brought against the HA by the Department of Justice; and</textblock>
