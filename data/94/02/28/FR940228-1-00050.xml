    <textblock>Notification of other entities</textblock>
    <textblock>. Under this proposed revision, as under the current regulations, the OIG would continue its practice of notifying hospitals at which a sanctioned practitioner has privileges, as well as State licensing boards and other entities, of any sanction action taken.</textblock>
    <textblock>III. Additional Information</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Regulatory Impact Statement</textblock>
    <textblock>The Office of Management and Budget has reviewed this proposed rule in accordance with the provisions of Executive Order 12866. As indicated above, the revisions contained in this proposed rule are intended to revise and update administrative procedures governing the imposition and adjudication of program sanctions, based on PRO recommendations, against practitioners and other persons who violate the statute. We believe that the great majority of practitioners and other persons do not engage in such prohibited activities and practices, and that the aggregate economic impact of these provisions should, in effect, be minimal, affecting only those who have engaged in prohibited behavior in violation of statutory intent. As such, these regulations should have no direct effect on the economy or on Federal or State expenditures.</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, we generally prepare a regulatory flexibility analysis that is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a proposed regulation would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. While some sanctions and penalties may have an impact on small entities, we do not anticipate that a substantial number of these small entities would be significantly affected by this rulemaking. Therefore, since we have determined, and the Secretary certifies, that this proposed rule would not have a significant economic impact on a number of small business entities, we have not prepared a regulatory flexibility analysis.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Response to Comments</textblock>
    <textblock>Because of the number of comments we normally receive on proposed regulations, we cannot acknowledge or respond to each letter individually. Rather, in preparing the final rule, we will consider all comments received timely and respond to the major issues in the preamble of that rule.</textblock>
