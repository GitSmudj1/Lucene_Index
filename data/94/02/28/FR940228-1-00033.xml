    <textblock>(b) Conduct an adequate survey of the radiographic exposure device with a radiation survey instrument after each exposure to determine that the sealed source has been returned to its shielded position.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Conduct a survey when approaching the guide tube before exchanging films, repositioning the collimator, or dismantling equipment.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Conduct an adequate survey with a radiation survey instrument any time the source is exchanged and whenever a radiographic exposure device is placed in a storage area (as defined in §34.3) to ensure that the sealed source is in its shielded position.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e) Conduct a survey of the storage area to ensure that radiation levels do not exceed the limits specified in 10 CFR 20.1301. These surveys must be performed initially with radioactive material present in the storage location and thereafter at the time of the quarterly inventory and whenever storage conditions change (i.e., increases in radioactive material present or changes in shielding or arrangement of the radioactive material).</textblock>
    <textblock>(f) Maintain records in accordance with §34.85.</textblock>
    <textblock>39. Section 34.51 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§34.51</textblock>
    <textblock>Surveillance.</textblock>
    <textblock>During each radiographic operation the radiographer or radiographer's assistant shall maintain continuous direct visual surveillance of the operation to protect against unauthorized entry into a high radiation area, as defined in part 20 of this chapter, except at permanent radiographic installations where all entryways are locked and the requirements of</textblock>
    <textblock>§34.33 are met.</textblock>
    <textblock>40. Section 34.53 is added to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§34.53</textblock>
    <textblock>Posting.</textblock>
    <textblock>Areas in which radiography is being performed must be conspicuously posted as required by §20.1902(a) and (b) of this chapter. Exceptions listed in</textblock>
    <textblock>§20.1903 of this chapter do not apply to radiographic operations.</textblock>
    <textblock>41. A new heading for subpart E, consisting of §§34.61-34.91, is added to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>Subpart E_Recordkeeping Requirements</textblock>
    <textblock>42. Section 34.61 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§34.61</textblock>
    <textblock>Records of specific license for radiography.</textblock>
    <textblock>Each licensee shall maintain a copy of its license, license conditions, documents incorporated by reference, and amendments to each of these items until superseded by new documents or until the Commission terminates the license.</textblock>
    <textblock>43. Section 34.63 is revised to read as follows:</textblock>
    <textblock>§34.63</textblock>
    <textblock>Records of receipt and transfer of sealed sources.</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Each licensee shall maintain records showing the receipts and transfers of sealed sources and retain each record for 3 years after it is made.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) These records must include the date, the individual making the record, the radionuclide, number of becquerels (curies), and make, model, and serial number of each sealed source and device, as appropriate.</textblock>
