    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The objectives of the conference are to give the licensees and the public insight into our approach to safety regulations and to provide a forum for feedback from those in attendance on their concerns about our overall approach, as well as feedback on differences that may exist on technical issues. NRC staff will provide information regarding on-going programs and potential new initiatives as a basis for discussion.</textblock>
    <textblock>Discussions will proceed from general (i.e., the plenary sessions) to specific (i.e., the breakout sessions), with emphasis on plant operations and the NRC view of these operations based on experience in carrying out its regulatory mission. Four plenary sessions are planned, three of which will be followed by breakout sessions that will include presentations by the NRC staff and industry representatives.</textblock>
