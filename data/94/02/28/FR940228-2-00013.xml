    <textblock>Parties to this proceeding may request disclosure within 5 days of the date of publication of this notice. Any interested party may request a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication of this notice. A general issues hearing, if requested, and any hearings regarding issues related solely to specific countries, if requested, will be held in accordance with the following schedule and at the indicated locations in the main Commerce building:</textblock>

    <textblock>Germany_March 29, 1994; 2:00 pm; room 1617-M-4</textblock>
    <textblock>Japan_March 30, 1994; 9:00 am; room 1617-M-1</textblock>
    <textblock>United Kingdom_March 30, 1994; 2:00 pm; room 1617-M-1</textblock>
    <textblock>France_March 31, 1994; 9:00 am; room 1617-M-4</textblock>
    <textblock>Sweden_March 31, 1994; 1:00 pm; room 1617-M-4</textblock>
    <textblock>Issues raised in hearings will be limited to those raised in the respective briefs or written comments, and rebuttal briefs or rebuttals to written comments. Briefs or written comments from interested parties, and rebuttal briefs or rebuttals to written comments, limited to the issues raised in the respective case briefs and comments, may be submitted not later than the dates shown below for general issues and the respective country-specific cases. The Department will subsequently publish the final results of these administrative reviews, including the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such written comments or hearings.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department shall determine, and the Customs Service shall assess, antidumping duties on all appropriate entries. Because sampling prevents calculation of duties on an entry-by-entry basis, we will</textblock>
    <textblock>calculate an importer-specific</textblock>
    <textblock>ad valorem</textblock>
    <textblock>duty assessment rate for each class or kind of merchandise based on the ratio of the total value of antidumping duties calculated for the examined sales made during the POR to the total customs value of the sales used to calculate those duties. This rate will be assessed uniformly on all entries of that particular importer made during the POR. (This is equivalent to dividing the total value of antidumping duties, which are calculated by taking the difference between statutory FMV and statutory USP, by the total statutory USP value of the sales compared, and adjusting the result by the average difference between USP and customs value for all merchandise examined during the POR.)</textblock>
    <textblock>Where we do not have entered customs value to calculate an</textblock>
    <textblock>ad valorem</textblock>
    <textblock>rate, we will calculate an average per-unit dollar amount of antidumping duty based on all sales examined during the POR. We will instruct the Customs Service to assess this average amount on all units included in each entry made by the particular importer during the POR. The Department will issue appropriate appraisement instructions directly to the Customs Service upon completion of these reviews.</textblock>
