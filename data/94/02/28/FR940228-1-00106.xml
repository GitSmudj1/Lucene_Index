    <textblock>The Secretary intends to continue the current policy</textblock>
    <textblock>regarding the inclusion of books, supplies, and other equipment</textblock>
    <textblock>in the</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund calculation consistent with guidance given</textblock>
    <textblock>to institutions that were required to use a</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund</textblock>
    <textblock>policy because the institution had a default rate that exceeds 30</textblock>
    <textblock>percent and was required to calculate a</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund for a</textblock>
    <textblock>student who received a loan under the FFEL programs. As is</textblock>
    <textblock>currently the case, an institution is required to include the</textblock>
    <textblock>full amount of charges for equipment in the calculation of</textblock>
    <textblock>pro</textblock>
    <textblock>rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund if a separate charge exists for the equipment by the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution or if the institution requires the student to</textblock>
    <textblock>purchase the equipment from a certain vendor. The Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>believes that by charging students a separate equipment charge or</textblock>
    <textblock>by requiring students to purchase the equipment from a single</textblock>
    <textblock>vendor (for example, a school book store) the equipment charges</textblock>
    <textblock>are being mandated by the institution and should be treated as</textblock>
    <textblock>institutional costs. In effect, the institution is the sole</textblock>
    <textblock>source of the equipment. If an institution does not have a</textblock>
    <textblock>separate charge for equipment and the student has the option of</textblock>
    <textblock>purchasing the equipment from more than one source, the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution would not have to include the equipment charge in the</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund calculation. An institution would have to be</textblock>
    <textblock>able to demonstrate that its students have the option of</textblock>
    <textblock>purchasing the equipment from other sources that are easily</textblock>
    <textblock>accessible to the student and that the students are advised that</textblock>
    <textblock>an option is available.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to allow an institution to subtract</textblock>
    <textblock>from the refund to a student any charges for equipment (including</textblock>
    <textblock>books and supplies) that a student could have returned for credit</textblock>
    <textblock>but did not do so. Under this provision, there would have to be</textblock>
    <textblock>a separate charge for the equipment, and the student must</textblock>
    <textblock>actually have obtained the equipment but failed to return the</textblock>
    <textblock>equipment within 20 days after his or her withdrawal. This</textblock>
    <textblock>provision was suggested by one of the negotiators and is based</textblock>
    <textblock>upon California law. By consensus of the negotiators, this</textblock>
    <textblock>provision would be extended to situations where the equipment and</textblock>
    <textblock>supplies are sold by an affiliate or related entity of the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution. If the student does not return the equipment, the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution could subtract from the</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund owed to the</textblock>
    <textblock>student the documented cost to the institution of equipment</textblock>
    <textblock>issued to the student. The student would be liable for the</textblock>
    <textblock>amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment</textblock>
    <textblock>exceeds the amount of the student's</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund.</textblock>
    <textblock>Under this proposal, if some or all of the equipment is not</textblock>
    <textblock>actually received by the student, the institution would have to</textblock>
    <textblock>include in the</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund calculation 100 percent of the</textblock>
    <textblock>amount paid for that portion of the equipment. Further, if an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution gives a student the option to return the equipment,</textblock>
    <textblock>the institution would not be permitted to subtract the cost of</textblock>
    <textblock>the equipment from the refund to the student if the student</textblock>
    <textblock>chooses to return the equipment and does so within 20 days of his</textblock>
    <textblock>or her withdrawal. The Secretary believes that 20 days provides</textblock>
    <textblock>the student with a sufficient period of time to return equipment</textblock>
    <textblock>without delaying the refund to the student.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes that any equipment returned by a</textblock>
    <textblock>student must be in good condition allowing for reasonable wear</textblock>
    <textblock>and tear. The Secretary notes that there may be restrictions</textblock>
    <textblock>under State laws that prevent an institution from accepting</textblock>
    <textblock>returned equipment due to health and sanitary reasons. Other</textblock>
    <textblock>conditions might also limit the return of equipment. For</textblock>
    <textblock>example, a workbook that has been written in or a damaged text</textblock>
    <textblock>book might not be reusable. The Secretary solicits comments on</textblock>
    <textblock>whether this provision should be expanded to identify other</textblock>
    <textblock>conditions that could affect the institution's ability to reissue</textblock>
    <textblock>equipment.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary notes that, because an institution must</textblock>
    <textblock>include the charges listed above in the calculation of a</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund and is then permitted to subtract the charges or a portion</textblock>
    <textblock>of the charges from this refund, in many cases it appears that an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution could retain more than the actual charge to the</textblock>
    <textblock>student. For example, if an institution that charges a $100</textblock>
    <textblock>administrative fee calculates a</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund to a student, a</textblock>
    <textblock>portion of the $100 charge would be refunded to the student in</textblock>
    <textblock>accordance with the</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund formula, and a portion of the</textblock>
    <textblock>charge would be retained by the institution. Yet, in addition,</textblock>
    <textblock>the institution could then be permitted to subtract the full $100</textblock>
    <textblock>from the refund to the student. The Secretary requests comments</textblock>
    <textblock>on whether it may be more appropriate to require institutions to</textblock>
    <textblock>exclude these charges from the refund calculation entirely rather</textblock>
    <textblock>than subtracting the charge after performing the calculation.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary also requests comment on whether some other means</textblock>
    <textblock>should be adopted to eliminate this potential ``double counting''</textblock>
    <textblock>of charges.</textblock>
    <textblock>For purposes of determining a</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund, the Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>proposes to exclude from the ``room charges'' that are to be</textblock>
    <textblock>included in the refund calculation, any room charges for</textblock>
    <textblock>off-campus housing that are passed through the institution in</textblock>
    <textblock>their entirety to an entity that is not under the control of,</textblock>
    <textblock>related to, or affiliated with the institution. The Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>recognizes that an institution may enter into an agreement with</textblock>
    <textblock>an outside agency to provide lodging for students. Under such an</textblock>
    <textblock>arrangement, the institution is merely a conduit that passes the</textblock>
    <textblock>room charges along to the other entity, yet those charges appear</textblock>
    <textblock>as institutional charges on student accounts. In these cases,</textblock>
    <textblock>the independence of the entities and the students' continuing</textblock>
    <textblock>right to occupy the housing after the students withdraw warrant</textblock>
    <textblock>the exclusion of the room charges from the refund calculation.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary also proposes to exclude from the</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund calculation charges for group health insurance that are</textblock>
    <textblock>mandatory for all students in the calculation of a</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund so long as the coverage remains in effect for the students</textblock>
    <textblock>throughout the period for which the student was charged. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary notes that the inclusion of these group health</textblock>
    <textblock>insurance charges in the refund calculation could cancel</textblock>
    <textblock>insurance coverage that might otherwise be extended to the</textblock>
    <textblock>student beyond the student's withdrawal date.</textblock>
