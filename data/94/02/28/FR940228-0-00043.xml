    <textblock>(g) If a financial institution executes a sell order of a customer (other than an order to execute a sale of securities which the seller does not own, which for the purposes of this paragraph shall mean that the customer placing the sell order has identified the sale as a short sale to the financial institution) and if for any reason whatever the financial institution has not obtained possession of the government securities, except mortgage-backed securities, from the customer within 30 calendar days, or in the case of mortgage-backed securities within 60 calendar days, after the settlement date, the financial institution shall immediately thereafter close the transaction with the customer by purchasing, or otherwise obtaining, securities of like kind and quantity.</textblock>
    <textblock>(h) The appropriate regulatory agency of a financial institution that is a government securities broker or dealer may extend the period specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(iii) and (g) of this section on application of the financial institution for one or more limited periods commensurate with the circumstances, provided the appropriate regulatory agency is satisfied that the financial institution is acting in good faith in making the application and that exceptional circumstances warrant such action. Each appropriate regulatory agency should make and preserve for a period of not less than three years a record of each extension granted pursuant to this paragraph, which contains a summary of the justification for the granting of the extension.</textblock>
