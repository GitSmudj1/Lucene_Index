    <textblock>2. What guidelines and time periods should be set for provisional certification?</textblock>
    <textblock>•Each institution should be treated on a case-by-case basis subject to the Secretary's discretion. [New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>•A two-year time period should be used for provisional certification. [New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>•The time period should not exceed three-years and the institution should have the ability to achieve full certification sooner. [San Francisco]</textblock>
    <textblock>F. Section 498(c)(5) provides that an institution must maintain sufficient cash reserves to ensure repayment of any required refunds. Institutions that participate in and contribute to a State tuition recovery fund would be exempt from this requirement.</textblock>
    <textblock>Issues that the community was asked to address and the community's views</textblock>
    <textblock>:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. What are sufficient cash reserves? How are they measured, what types of funds may be included, and how are they protected from use for other purposes?</textblock>
    <textblock>•Sufficient cash reserves should be defined as a certain percent of unearned tuition based on the institution's refund history and established only when there is an indication of a problem or high-risk institution. This could be part of provisional certification. [New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>•Sufficient cash reserves should be defined as 100 percent of any unearned tuition liability from Title IV awards. A minority of the group thought an amount to cover loans where the loan guarantee might be invalidated because of fraud should also be included. Cash reserves should include cash, accounts receivable, and liquid assets that can be converted to cash within 30 days. [Kansas City]</textblock>
    <textblock>•If the institution has been timely (60 days) in processing refunds for one year, no cash reserves should be required. If the institution has not been timely, an increasing percentage should be reserved based on the total Title IV funds processed by the institution. The regulations should be written to provide incentives for institutions with a good performance record. The Department should take into account whether the refunds were delinquent because of personnel problems as compared to a poor financial position. When an institution is required to reserve cash, any earnings should accrue to the institution. Letters of credit should be permitted as a substitute for a cash reserve. [San Francisco]</textblock>
    <textblock>•A cash reserve is sufficient if it equals anticipated refund to be paid during a 30 day period based on the average of refunds paid during the preceding 12 month period. Cash reserves are defined as cash and cash equivalents plus other current assets that can be converted to cash within 30 days. Segregation of the cash reserve is not required by law nor is it desirable. [Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. What are the components of a state tuition recovery fund that demonstrates that an institution contributing to the fund will be able to pay refunds?</textblock>
    <textblock>•If an institution contributes to a State tuition recovery fund they should be exempt automatically from this requirement. [New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>•The components of a State tuition recovery fund that will demonstrate that an institution contributing to the fund will be able to pay refunds are those tuition recovery components that will pay a lender the required refund and/or pay the student the required refund. [Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>3. What information must institutions provide to permit the Secretary to determine that an institution will be able to use the tuition recovery fund to pay refunds if the institution itself is unable to do so?</textblock>
    <textblock>•An institution should provide a letter from the State that confirms that they will be able to use the State tuition recovery fund to pay refunds. [New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>•An institution should provide a description of the legal structure of the fund and audited financial statements so the Secretary may determine that the institution will be able to use the tuition recovery fund. [San Francisco]</textblock>
