    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule exempts a new system of records entitled ``Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' from compliance with the applicable provisions of the Privacy Act. This additional exemption is necessary because on July 12, 1993, the Department created a new system of records entitled ``HUD/PIH-1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' to add to the Privacy Act system of records.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>Except for the Office of Inspector General, the Department's implementation of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a) is set forth in 24 CFR part 16. (The implementation of the Privacy Act for the Office of Inspector General appears in 24 CFR part 2003). The implementation of the Privacy Act includes the publication of a system of records which are exempt from certain requirements of the Privacy Act, as determined by the Secretary under the specific exemption authority of the Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k). The specific exemption provision of the Privacy Act authorizes exemption for systems of records from many of the notice and access requirements of the Privacy Act, but does not affect the applicability of the remaining Privacy Act requirements. The Department's specific exemptions appear at 24 CFR 16.15.</textblock>
    <textblock>The establishment of a new system of records on July 12, 1993 (58 FR 37600), entitled ``HUD/PIH-1. Tenant Eligibility Verification Files,'' and this rule are necessary as a result of the recent transfer of computer matching/tenant eligibility verification functions from the Office of Inspector General to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing. (The transfer affects only housing assistance programs administered by the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing.)</textblock>
    <textblock>The tenant records and other records referenced in the new ``Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' system of records notice were previously included in the ``Investigative Files of the Office of the Inspector General'' (HUD/OIG-1, see 57 FR 25070). The Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing will be adding records to the final new system based on computer matching results and verification of those results with tenant case files and records supplied by Federal agencies and private employers.</textblock>
    <textblock>This final rule also makes changes to ยง16.15 to clarify the scope of the exemptions applicable to the Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing's system of records entitled ``Tenant Eligibility Verification Files,'' and provides reasons for the exemptions from particular subsections of the Privacy Act that are more detailed than those currently found at 24 CFR 16.15.</textblock>
    <textblock>II. Discussion of Public Comments From Proposed Rule</textblock>
    <textblock>On July 12, 1993 (58 FR 37598), the Department published a proposed rule which would exempt the new system of records entitled ``Tenant Eligibility Verification Files'' from compliance with applicable provisions of the Privacy Act. The Department received one public comment from a public housing agency in response to this proposed rule. The commenter stressed the need to protect a tenant's privacy, and urged strenuous penalties to prevent misuse of the new system of records. The Department agrees that it is extremely important to prevent the misuse of confidential material concerning a tenant. However, the Department does not believe any changes to the final rule are necessary because both the Privacy Act and the Computer Matching and Privacy Protection Act of 1988 provide sufficient safeguards to protect against the unlawful disclosure of material concerning a tenant from this Privacy Act system of records.</textblock>
