    <textblock>•This section should not apply to: 1) delays by lenders</textblock>
    <textblock>or guarantors in delivering loan proceeds which are not</textblock>
    <textblock>caused by the necessity of complying with Title IV</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements; and 2) delays attributable to the</textblock>
    <textblock>student's not providing information by known,</textblock>
    <textblock>published, or noticed deadlines, that the institution,</textblock>
    <textblock>lender, or guarantor must have in order to comply with</textblock>
    <textblock>Title IV requirements. (Example, IRS 1040 forms for</textblock>
    <textblock>verification.)</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary should regulate in such a way that it is</textblock>
    <textblock>clear that institutions may charge reasonable interest</textblock>
    <textblock>on unpaid bills where the delay in Title IV delivery is</textblock>
    <textblock>attributed to the student or an agency other than the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution. [Kansas City]</textblock>
    <textblock>•This section does not address delays for which the</textblock>
    <textblock>student has not met public deadlines or performed all</textblock>
    <textblock>obligations necessary to ensure the delivery of timely</textblock>
    <textblock>aid. [Kansas City]</textblock>
    <textblock>•If the student does not provide documents, it is not</textblock>
    <textblock>applicable. It should relate only to a 30 day delayed</textblock>
    <textblock>disbursement. [Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>•No constraints should be put on a student for the delay</textblock>
    <textblock>of that portion of tuition covered by the first-time</textblock>
    <textblock>Stafford loan or in the case of institutional delay.</textblock>
    <textblock>[New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>•Consideration should be given to the laws of various</textblock>
    <textblock>states since they differ as to when a student must meet</textblock>
    <textblock>his or her financial obligation at an institution.</textblock>
    <textblock>[San Francisco]</textblock>
    <textblock>3. If a delay is caused by the lender or institution can the</textblock>
    <textblock>guarantee agency take actions that are prohibited under other</textblock>
    <textblock>circumstances?</textblock>
    <textblock>•No, a guaranty agency should not be allowed to take</textblock>
    <textblock>action if the delay is caused by the lender or</textblock>
    <textblock>institution. [New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>•G. Section 487(a)(20) prohibits an institution from paying a</textblock>
    <textblock>commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or</textblock>
    <textblock>indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to</textblock>
    <textblock>any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or</textblock>
    <textblock>admission activities or in making decisions regarding the</textblock>
    <textblock>awarding of student financial assistance.</textblock>
    <textblock>Issues that the community was asked to address and the</textblock>
    <textblock>community's views:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. How should the Department determine that an institution is</textblock>
    <textblock>not providing commissions, bonuses, and other incentive payments?</textblock>
    <textblock>•Compliance should be determined through the audit</textblock>
    <textblock>process. Auditors check employment and payroll</textblock>
    <textblock>records. [San Francisco, Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. If an institution awards merit pay to salaried employees in</textblock>
    <textblock>increments as the student successfully completes portions of the</textblock>
    <textblock>course, graduates, or gets placed in a job, would the institution</textblock>
    <textblock>be in compliance?</textblock>
    <textblock>•Institutions should be allowed to provide merit</textblock>
    <textblock>incentives to employees as long as it cannot be</textblock>
    <textblock>attached to the enrollment process (i.e., servicing</textblock>
    <textblock>retaining, and placing students after the first day of</textblock>
    <textblock>class at the institution.) [Kansas City]</textblock>
    <textblock>Salaried employees should be rewarded for retention.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any compensation (non-salaried) for the enrollment of</textblock>
    <textblock>financial aid students is illegal. There appears to be</textblock>
    <textblock>opposition to compensating for the ``warm body count''</textblock>
    <textblock>and financial aid packages, but it does seem that the</textblock>
    <textblock>statute allows for a legitimate basis for compensation</textblock>
    <textblock>above base salary for areas such as retention, however</textblock>
    <textblock>defined, and/or completion rates. [New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>•As the intent appears to be elimination of head count</textblock>
    <textblock>recruitment commissions, bonuses on merit pay may be</textblock>
    <textblock>made as long as they are not made solely as the basis</textblock>
    <textblock>of recruitment of the student. The Department should</textblock>
    <textblock>define who is an employee. [Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>•The institution would be in compliance if an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution awards merit pay to salaried employees in</textblock>
    <textblock>increments as the student successfully completes</textblock>
    <textblock>portions or the course, graduates, or gets placed in a</textblock>
    <textblock>job. [Kansas City]</textblock>
