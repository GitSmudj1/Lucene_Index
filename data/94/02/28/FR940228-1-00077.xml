    <textblock>Finally, the Secretary proposes to use provisional</textblock>
    <textblock>certification for institutions that seek a renewal of</textblock>
    <textblock>participation in a Title IV, HEA program after the expiration of</textblock>
    <textblock>a prior period of participation in that program. The Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>will examine the reasons for the lapse in participation to</textblock>
    <textblock>determine if additional safeguards are necessary for the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution to demonstrate that it is capable of resuming its</textblock>
    <textblock>participation in the Title IV, HEA programs.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary does not intend to certify an institution</textblock>
    <textblock>provisionally if the institution does not meet the financial</textblock>
    <textblock>responsibility standards, unless the institution provides the</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary with certain additional financial guarantees of its</textblock>
    <textblock>ability to continue operating. The Secretary believes that</textblock>
    <textblock>additional financial guarantees are necessary in that situation</textblock>
    <textblock>to ensure that funds may be available to repay liabilities or to</textblock>
    <textblock>pay required refunds that could arise under the Title IV, HEA</textblock>
    <textblock>programs. The Secretary generally does not intend to certify an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution provisionally if the institution does not meet the</textblock>
    <textblock>general standards of financial responsibility or the exceptions</textblock>
    <textblock>to the general standards of financial responsibility under</textblock>
    <textblock>proposed ยง668.15(d) unless the institution meets three additional</textblock>
    <textblock>conditions. First, the institution would have to demonstrate to</textblock>
    <textblock>the satisfaction of the Secretary that it has sufficient</textblock>
    <textblock>financial and administrative resources to participate in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Title IV, HEA programs under a funding arrangement other than the</textblock>
    <textblock>Department of Educations's standard advance funding arrangement.</textblock>
    <textblock>For example, the institution could be funded through an escrow</textblock>
    <textblock>arrangement where an approved third party controls the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution's access to Title IV, HEA program funds. The</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary believes that it is necessary for the Department of</textblock>
    <textblock>Education to have the added control over Title IV, HEA program</textblock>
    <textblock>funds provided by an escrow arrangement. Second, the institution</textblock>
    <textblock>would have to submit to the Secretary a letter of credit payable</textblock>
    <textblock>to the Secretary equal to not less than 10 percent of the Title</textblock>
    <textblock>IV, HEA program funds received by the institution during the last</textblock>
    <textblock>complete award year for which figures are available; the</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary believes that 10 percent of an institution's Title IV,</textblock>
    <textblock>HEA program funds is the minimum necessary to ensure repayment of</textblock>
    <textblock>liabilities that may be identified during the institution's</textblock>
    <textblock>period of provisional certification. Further, the Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>believes that the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds received</textblock>
    <textblock>by an institution during the last complete award year for which</textblock>
    <textblock>figures are available provides the most accurate indication of</textblock>
    <textblock>the amount of Title IV, HEA program funds the institution will</textblock>
    <textblock>use in the next award year. Third, the institution would have to</textblock>
    <textblock>demonstrate that it has met all of its financial obligations</textblock>
    <textblock>during the preceding two award years, including (but not limited</textblock>
    <textblock>to) the payment of required refunds and repayments to the</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary for liabilities and debts incurred in programs</textblock>
    <textblock>administered by the Secretary. The Secretary believes that an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution that could meet this proposed standard has</textblock>
    <textblock>established a track record for meeting its financial obligations.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary notes that an institution that is applying for</textblock>
    <textblock>initial participation in the Title IV, HEA programs could not</textblock>
    <textblock>satisfy the proposed requirement that the institution submit to</textblock>
    <textblock>the Secretary a letter of credit payable to the Secretary equal</textblock>
    <textblock>to not less than 10 percent of the Title IV, HEA program funds</textblock>
    <textblock>received by the institution during the last complete award year</textblock>
    <textblock>for which figures are available because the institution would not</textblock>
    <textblock>have received any Title IV, HEA program funds during the last</textblock>
    <textblock>award year. The Secretary requests comments on a comparable way</textblock>
    <textblock>to determine the amount of a letter of credit for an institution</textblock>
    <textblock>that is applying for initial participation in the Title IV, HEA</textblock>
    <textblock>programs.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary also would impose additional conditions on any</textblock>
    <textblock>institution that has not been considered financially responsible</textblock>
    <textblock>under proposed ยง668.15 at any time within the past five years, or</textblock>
    <textblock>if the institution is not considered financially responsible for</textblock>
    <textblock>one of the following reasons (as delineated in ยง668.15(c)(2)):</textblock>
    <textblock>(1) The institution has been limited, suspended, terminated or</textblock>
    <textblock>entered into a settlement agreement to resolve such an action by</textblock>
    <textblock>the Secretary or a guaranty agency within the preceding five</textblock>
    <textblock>years; (2) the institution had an audit finding during its two</textblock>
    <textblock>most recent audits, or a program review finding during its two</textblock>
    <textblock>most recent program reviews, that resulted in the institution's</textblock>
    <textblock>being required to repay an amount greater than five percent of</textblock>
    <textblock>the Title IV, HEA funds that the institution received for any</textblock>
    <textblock>award year covered by the audit or the program review; or (3) the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution failed to address satisfactorily any compliance</textblock>
    <textblock>problems identified in program review or audit reports based upon</textblock>
    <textblock>a final decision of the Secretary.</textblock>
