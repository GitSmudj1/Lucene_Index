  <summary>
    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This proposed rule would revise and update the procedures governing the imposition and adjudication of program sanctions predicated on recommendations of State Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organizations (PROs). These changes are necessitated by statutory revisions addressing health care fraud and abuse issues and the OIG sanctions process. In addition, this proposed rule also sets forth new appeal and reinstatement procedures for practitioners and other persons excluded by the OIG based on a PRO recommendation.</textblock>

    <textblock>I. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The Medicare Utilization and Quality Control Peer Review Organization (PRO) program was established to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive medical care that meets professionally recognized standards. Section 1156 of the Social Security Act (the Act) sets forth specific statutory obligations imposed on practitioners and other persons to furnish necessary services meeting professionally recognized standards. The statute also authorizes the Secretary, based on a PRO's recommendation, to impose sanctions (exclusion from Medicare and any State health care program participation as defined under section 1128 of the Act or a monetary penalty) on those who fail to comply with the statutory obligations.</textblock>
