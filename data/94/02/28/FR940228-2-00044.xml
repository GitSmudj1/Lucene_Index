    <textblock>Effective February 28, 1994, the EPA is announcing the availability of a new edition of its National Directory of AHERA Accredited Courses (NDAAC).

As a nationwide listing of approved asbestos training programs and courses, the NDAAC has replaced the similar listing which was formerly published quarterly by EPA in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>. The February 28, 1994, directory, which supersedes the version released on November 30, 1993, may be ordered through the NDAAC Clearinghouse along with a variety of related reports.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to AHERA, as amended by the Asbestos School Hazard Abatement Reauthorization Act (ASHARA), contractors who prepare management plans for schools, inspect for asbestos in schools or public and commercial buildings, or design or conduct response actions with respect to friable asbestos-containing materials in schools or public and commercial buildings, are required to obtain accreditation by completing prescribed training requirements. EPA therefore maintains a current national listing of AHERA-accredited courses and approved training providers so that this information will be readily available to assist the public in accessing these training programs and obtaining the necessary accreditation. The information is also maintained so that the Agency and approved state accreditation and licensing programs will have a reliable means of identifying and verifying the approval status of training courses and organizations.</textblock>
    <textblock>Previously, EPA had published this listing in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on a quarterly basis. The last</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>listing required by law was published on August 30, 1991. EPA recognized the need to continue publication of this document even though the legislative mandate had expired. The NDAAC fulfills the public need for this information while at the same time, it reduces EPA cost and improves the service's capabilities.</textblock>
