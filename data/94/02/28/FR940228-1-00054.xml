If the PRO affirms its findings, it may suggest in writing a method for correcting the situation and a time period for corrective action. This CAP could correspond with, or be a continuation of, a prior CAP or be a new proposal based on additional information received by the PRO. If the issue has been resolved to the PRO's satisfaction, the PRO may modify its initial finding and close the case.</textblock>

Both requirements could be met by a single individual. In addition, no one at the PRO who is a participant in such a finding may be in direct economic competition with, or have a substantial bias against, the practitioner or other person being recommended for sanction.</textblock>
