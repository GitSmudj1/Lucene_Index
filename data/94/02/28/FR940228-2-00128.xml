    <textblock>Paperwork Reduction Act Statement</textblock>
    <textblock>The information collection requirements contained in this notice have been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501-3520). Information on the estimated public reporting burden was provided for public comment in a separate notice published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>on February 17, 1994 (59 FR 8012). The Department expects that a control number will be issued by OMB about March 22, 1994, after completion of a 30-day comment period for the paperwork burden notice. The OMB control number, when assigned, will be announced by separate notice in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>

    <textblock>No person may be subjected to a penalty for failure to comply with the information collection requirements until they have been approved and assigned an OMB control number. The public reporting burden for the collection of information requirements contained in the February 17 notice is estimated to include the time for reviewing the instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. The February 17 notice invites interested persons to submit comments on the paperwork burden proposals to Joseph F. Lackey, Jr., OMB Desk Officer, Office of Management and Budget, New Executive Office Building, Washington, DC 20503.</textblock>
