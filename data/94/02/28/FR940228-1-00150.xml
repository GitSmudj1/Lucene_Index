    <textblock>(IV)</textblock>
    <textblock>The institution must clearly designate all optional</textblock>
    <textblock>charges as ``optional'' in all published schedules and related</textblock>
    <textblock>materials.</textblock>
    <textblock>Charges that are mandatory and charges that are</textblock>
    <textblock>optional must be plainly differentiated in all printed materials.</textblock>
    <textblock>Statements accompanying the schedule may include institutional</textblock>
    <textblock>endorsements of the optional program or service. The institution</textblock>
    <textblock>must state clearly in its schedule if a charge is optional for</textblock>
    <textblock>some students but required for others.</textblock>
    <textblock>(V)</textblock>
    <textblock>The institution must clearly identify charges and</textblock>
    <textblock>deposits that are nonrefundable as ``nonrefundable'' on all</textblock>
    <textblock>published schedules.</textblock>
    <textblock>Institutions determine on an individual</textblock>
    <textblock>basis which of their charges are refundable or nonrefundable. In</textblock>
    <textblock>general, admission fees, application fees, laboratory fees,</textblock>
    <textblock>facility and student activity fees, and other similar charges are</textblock>
    <textblock>not refundable. These fees are generally charged to cover the</textblock>
    <textblock>cost of activities such as processing applications and other</textblock>
    <textblock>student information, reserving academic positions and</textblock>
    <textblock>establishing the limits of institutional programs and services,</textblock>
    <textblock>reserving housing space, and otherwise setting the fixed costs of</textblock>
    <textblock>the institution for the coming academic periods.</textblock>
    <textblock>Institutions determine on an individual basis which of their</textblock>
    <textblock>deposits are refundable or nonrefundable. Some deposits will be</textblock>
    <textblock>nonrefundable or will be credited to a student's account (e.g.,</textblock>
    <textblock>tuition deposits). Others are refundable according to the terms</textblock>
    <textblock>of the deposit agreement (e.g., deposits for breakage).</textblock>
    <textblock>(VI)</textblock>
    <textblock>The institution must refund housing rental charges,</textblock>
    <textblock>less a deposit, as long as written notification of cancellation</textblock>
    <textblock>is made prior to a well-publicized date that provides reasonable</textblock>
    <textblock>opportunity to make the space available to other students.</textblock>
    <textblock>Written notification on or before the beginning of the term of</textblock>
    <textblock>the contract is necessary to ensure utilization of housing units.</textblock>
    <textblock>During the term of the contract, room charges are generally not</textblock>
    <textblock>refundable. However, based on the program offered, space</textblock>
    <textblock>availability, debt service requirements, State and local laws,</textblock>
    <textblock>and other individual circumstances, institutions may provide for</textblock>
    <textblock>some more flexible refund guideline for housing.</textblock>
    <textblock>(VII)</textblock>
    <textblock>The institution must refund board charges in full,</textblock>
    <textblock>less a deposit, if written notification of cancellation is made</textblock>
    <textblock>prior to a well-publicized date that falls on or before the</textblock>
    <textblock>beginning of the term of the contract.</textblock>
    <textblock>Subsequent board charges</textblock>
    <textblock>should be refunded on a</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>basis. It is reasonable to make</textblock>
    <textblock>a refund for those goods and services not consumed. The deposit</textblock>
    <textblock>should reflect that portion of an institution's costs that are</textblock>
    <textblock>fixed for the term of the contract.</textblock>
    <textblock>(VIII)</textblock>
    <textblock>The institutional refund policy must include the</textblock>
    <textblock>following requirements:</textblock>
    <textblock>A. The institution must refund 100 percent of the tuition</textblock>
    <textblock>charges, less an administrative fee that does not exceed the</textblock>
    <textblock>lesser of $100 or 5 percent of the tuition, if the student</textblock>
    <textblock>submits written notice of cancellation on or before one week</textblock>
    <textblock>preceding the first day of classes for the period of enrollment</textblock>
    <textblock>for which the student was charged.</textblock>
    <textblock>B. The institution must refund at least 90 percent of the</textblock>
    <textblock>tuition charges if the student submits written notice of</textblock>
    <textblock>cancellation between the end of the period of time specified in</textblock>
    <textblock>(VIII) A. and the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of the</textblock>
    <textblock>period of enrollment for which the student was charged.</textblock>
    <textblock>C. The institution must refund at least 50 percent of the</textblock>
    <textblock>tuition charges if the student submits written notice of</textblock>
    <textblock>cancellation between the end of the first 10 percent (in time) of</textblock>
    <textblock>the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and</textblock>
    <textblock>the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of that period of</textblock>
    <textblock>enrollment.</textblock>
    <textblock>D. The institution must refund at least 25 percent of the</textblock>
    <textblock>tuition charges if the student submits written notice of</textblock>
    <textblock>cancellation between the end of the first 25 percent (in time) of</textblock>
    <textblock>the period of enrollment for which the student was charged and</textblock>
    <textblock>the end of the first 50 percent (in time) of the period of</textblock>
    <textblock>enrollment.</textblock>
    <textblock>E. The institution may deduct from the refund owed under</textblock>
    <textblock>this paragraph the documented cost to the institution of</textblock>
    <textblock>equipment issued to the student if the institution specifies in</textblock>
    <textblock>the enrollment agreement a separate charge for equipment that the</textblock>
    <textblock>student actually obtains or if the institution refers the student</textblock>
    <textblock>to a vendor operated by an affiliated or related entity and the</textblock>
    <textblock>student does not return the equipment in good condition, allowing</textblock>
    <textblock>for reasonable wear and tear, within 20 days following the date</textblock>
    <textblock>of the student's withdrawal. The student shall be liable for the</textblock>
    <textblock>amount, if any, by which the documented cost for equipment</textblock>
    <textblock>exceeds the refund under this paragraph. Equipment is not</textblock>
    <textblock>considered to be returned in good condition if the equipment</textblock>
    <textblock>cannot be reused because of clearly recognized health and</textblock>
    <textblock>sanitary reasons, and this fact is clearly and conspicuously</textblock>
    <textblock>disclosed in the enrollment agreement.</textblock>
    <textblock>(IX)</textblock>
    <textblock>The institution must assess no penalty charges where</textblock>
    <textblock>the institution, as opposed to the student, is in error.</textblock>
    <textblock>Penalty</textblock>
    <textblock>charges, such as those involving late registration fees,</textblock>
    <textblock>change-of-schedule fees, and late payment fees, must not be</textblock>
    <textblock>assessed if it is determined that the student is not responsible</textblock>
    <textblock>for the action causing the charges to be levied.</textblock>
