    <textblock>Each HA receiving a grant shall submit to HUD an annual progress report, participant evaluation and assessment data and other information, as needed, regarding the effectiveness of FIC in achieving self-sufficiency.</textblock>
    <textblock>G. Ranking Factors</textblock>
    <textblock>Each application for grant award will be evaluated if it is submitted as required under Section II.B of this NOFA and meets the eligibility requirements in Section I.E of this NOFA. Applications submitted for funds that include renovation, conversion, or combination of dwelling unit activities will be competitively selected based on the highest scores out of a possible 135 points. Applications submitted for funds solely to implement supportive services will be competitively selected based on the highest scores out of a possible 140 points.</textblock>
    <textblock>Initially, HUD will distribute funds geographically in order to seek diversity through an appropriate mix of public and Indian housing authorities. Grants will be awarded to the two highest ranked eligible applicants in each funding category per HUD region. In addition, grants will be awarded to the two highest ranked eligible IHA applications in each funding category on a nationwide basis. All of the remaining applications will then be placed in overall nationwide ranking order, with the remaining funds granted in order of rank until all funds are awarded.</textblock>
    <textblock>HUD will review and evaluate the application as follows, according to whether the application seeks funds for supportive services only or for other activities.</textblock>
