    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>The Department of the Treasury (``Department'') is issuing in final form amendments to the regulations issued under the Government Securities Act of 1986, as amended (the ``Government Securities Act'' or ``GSA''). The amendments implement a buy-in requirement for mortgage-backed securities that are in a fail to receive status for more than 60 calendar days; and all government securities that are needed to complete a customer sell order (other than a short sale) if the securities have not been received from the customer within 30 calendar days after the settlement date for all government securities except mortgage-backed securities, or 60 calendar days after the settlement date for mortgage-backed securities. The final rule adopts without substantive change the buy-in requirements for mortgage-backed securities in a fail to receive status that were prescribed in the proposed rules published for comment on April 17, 1991. However, the time frames for buy-ins of customer sell orders have been revised in the final rule in response to comments received on the proposed rules. These requirements apply to all entities that are required to register or provide notice of their status as government securities brokers and dealers.</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>I. Background</textblock>
    <textblock>The GSA regulations currently require a government securities broker or dealer to take prompt steps to obtain possession or control of customers' fully paid or excess margin securities that have been in a fail to receive status for more than 30 calendar days through a buy-in procedure or otherwise. However, mortgage-backed securities are not subject to this buy-in requirement since the Department suspended the application of this rule to such securities in the GSA regulations that were issued in July 1987.</textblock>
    <textblock>1</textblock>
    <textblock>In addition, the current GSA regulations do not impose a buy-in requirement for customer sell orders where the government securities broker or dealer has not obtained the securities from its customer. A temporary rule imposing such a requirement on registered government securities brokers and dealers was suspended in the July 1987 GSA regulations issued by the Department.</textblock>
    <textblock>2</textblock>
    <textblock>On April 17, 1991, the Department proposed for comment amendments to sections 403.1, 403.4, and 403.5 of the GSA regulations.</textblock>
    <textblock>3</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed amendments prescribed buy-in requirements for: (i) Mortgage-backed securities in a fail to receive status for more than 60 calendar days, and (ii) customer sell orders (other than short sales) in which the securities were not received from the customer within ten business days after the settlement date.</textblock>
    <textblock>The proposed rule was intended to subject mortgage-backed securities to a 60 calendar day buy-in requirement, rather than the 30 calendar days applicable to other government securities due to the unique nature of the mortgage-backed market, particularly the lengthy settlement cycle. The reader is referred to the preamble to the proposed rule</textblock>
    <textblock>4</textblock>
    <textblock>for a more detailed discussion of the Department's reasons for adopting a 60 calendar day time frame for buy-ins of mortgage-backed securities. The proposed rulemaking also included buy-in rules for customer sell orders that would apply to all government securities brokers and dealers, including financial institutions. Specifically, the provisions proposed that if a government securities broker or dealer executes a customer sell order (other than a short sale) and the broker or dealer has not obtained the securities from the customer within ten business days after the settlement date, then the broker or dealer would be required to close out the transaction with the customer by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity. The Department specifically requested comments concerning the appropriateness of the ten-day time frame.</textblock>

    <textblock>See 56 FR 15529 (April 17, 1991). The rule changes to these three sections of the GSA regulations would make the buy-in requirements applicable to all classes of government securities brokers and dealers that were required to register or file notice pursuant to section 15C(a)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-5(a)(1)). Section 403.1 would apply to registered brokers and dealers that were required to file notice as government securities brokers and dealers with the Securities and Exchange Commission; section 403.4 would apply to registered government securities brokers and dealers (i.e., those entities that were required to register with the SEC); and section 403.5 would apply to financial institutions that were required to file notice as government securities brokers and dealers with their respective appropriate regulatory agency.</textblock>
