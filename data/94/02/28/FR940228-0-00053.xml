    <textblock>SUMMARY:</textblock>
    <textblock>This document extends tolerances for the residues of the seven synthetic pyrethroids_permethrin, cypermethrin, fenvalerate/esfenvalerate, tralomethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin (collectively referred to as the synthetic pyrethroids)_in or on certain raw agricultural commodities. This rule to extend the effective date for tolerances for maximum permissible levels of residues of these synthetic pyrethroids in or on these commodities was requested by FMC Corp. (FMC), Zeneca Ag Products, E.I. DuPont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc., Hoechst-Roussel Agri-Vet Co., and Miles, Inc. (collectively called the industry's Pyrethroid Working Group (PWG)).</textblock>

    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>In the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of October 20, 1993 (58 FR 54093), EPA issued a proposed rule to amend 40 CFR part 180 by extending to November 15, 1994, tolerances for the residues of the seven synthetic pyrethroids in or on certain commodities. The Pyrethroid Working Group had requested the extension.</textblock>
    <textblock>There were no comments or requests for referral to an advisory committee received in response to the proposed rule.</textblock>
    <textblock>The data submitted in conjunction with the extension request and in previous extensions for the synthetic pyrethroids have been evaluated and discussed in the proposed rule. Based on the data and information considered, the Agency concludes that the tolerance extensions will protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerance extensions are established as set forth below.</textblock>
    <textblock>Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days after publication of this document in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register,</textblock>
    <textblock>file written objections and/or request a hearing with the Hearing Clerk, at the address given above (40 CFR 178.20). A copy of the objections and/or hearing requests filed with the Hearing Clerk should be submitted to the OPP docket for this rulemaking. The objections submitted must specify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the grounds for the objections (40 CFR 178.25). Each objection must be accompanied by the fee prescribed by 40 CFR 180.33(i). If a hearing is requested, the objections must include a statement of the factual issue(s) on which a hearing is requested, the requestor's contentions on such issues, and a summary of any evidence relied upon by the objector (40 CFR 178.27). A request for a hearing will be granted if the Administrator determines that the material submitted shows the following: There is a genuine and substantial issue of fact; there is a reasonable possibility that available evidence identified by the requestor would, if established, resolve one or more of such issues in favor of the requestor, taking into account uncontested claims or facts to the contrary; and resolution of the factual issue(s) in the manner sought by the requestor would be adequate to justify the action requested (40 CFR 178.32).</textblock>
    <textblock>The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirements of Executive Order 12866.</textblock>
    <textblock>Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determined that regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levels or establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certification statement to this effect was published in the</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal Register</textblock>
    <textblock>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).</textblock>
