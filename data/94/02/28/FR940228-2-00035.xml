    <textblock>[Docket No. CP94-226-000]</textblock>
    <textblock>Take notice that on February 14, 1994, El Paso Natural Gas Company (El Paso), P.O. Box 1492, El Paso, Texas 79978, filed in Docket No. CP94-226-000 a request pursuant to Section 157.205 of the Commission's Regulations under the Natural Gas Act (18 CFR 157.205) for authorization to continue the operation of an existing delivery point, installed under Section 311(a) of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (NGPA) in Lea County, New Mexico, under El Paso's blanket certificate issued in Docket No. CP82-435-000 pursuant to Section 7 of the Natural Gas Act, all as more fully set forth in the request which is on file with the Commission and open to public inspection.</textblock>
    <textblock>El Paso, it is said, installed the Cabot Hobbs Meter Station under Section 311(a) of the NGPA and has exclusively used it for the transportation and delivery of natural gas under Part 284, Subpart B. El Paso states that the regulatory restriction placed on the operation of a facility installed under Section 311(a) of the NGPA prohibits El Paso's shippers from utilizing this delivery point under any transportation arrangement other than a Subpart B transportation arrangement.</textblock>
    <textblock>El Paso states further that it now requests authorization to continue the operation of the facility under the Natural Gas Act.</textblock>
