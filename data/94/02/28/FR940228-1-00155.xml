    <textblock>III. Program Participation Agreement</textblock>
    <textblock>A. Section 487(a)(5) requires an institution to provide</textblock>
    <textblock>assurances that the institution will provide, upon request and in</textblock>
    <textblock>a timely fashion, information relating to its administrative</textblock>
    <textblock>capability and financial responsibility to the Secretary, the</textblock>
    <textblock>designated State postsecondary review entity designated under</textblock>
    <textblock>subpart 1 of part H of Title IV of the HEA, the appropriate</textblock>
    <textblock>guaranty agency, and accrediting agency or association.</textblock>
    <textblock>Issues that the community was asked to address and the</textblock>
    <textblock>community's views:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. How should agencies obtain this information from</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions?</textblock>
    <textblock>•Other agencies should obtain the information through</textblock>
    <textblock>IPEDS or accrediting agency annual reports.</textblock>
    <textblock>[San Francisco]</textblock>
    <textblock>•Requests should be made in writing to the Chief</textblock>
    <textblock>Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer of</textblock>
    <textblock>the institution. [Kansas City]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Should there be a standard information-sharing format?</textblock>
    <textblock>•There should be a standard information sharing format</textblock>
    <textblock>provided that the institution is allowed to report</textblock>
    <textblock>using its accounting system. [Kansas City]</textblock>
    <textblock>•There needs to be a standard information sharing format</textblock>
    <textblock>that can be completed readily and corresponds to the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution's fiscal year. [New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>•The Department should provide a single form that can be</textblock>
    <textblock>used for all agencies. [Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>B. Section 487(a)(8)(B) requires institutions that advertise job</textblock>
    <textblock>placement rates to make available to prospective students</textblock>
    <textblock>relevant State licensing requirements for any job for which the</textblock>
    <textblock>course of instruction is designed to prepare the student.</textblock>
    <textblock>Issues that the community was asked to address and the</textblock>
    <textblock>community's views:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. How often should institutions be required to update</textblock>
    <textblock>licensing data?</textblock>
    <textblock>•Institutions should update the data whenever State</textblock>
    <textblock>licensing agencies require that updates or regulation</textblock>
    <textblock>must occur. [San Francisco, Kansas City, Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>•Information always needs to be current. [New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Should there be a standard format for providing this</textblock>
    <textblock>information to prospective students?</textblock>
    <textblock>•A typical brochure should be used to convey information</textblock>
    <textblock>to students. [San Francisco]</textblock>
    <textblock>•There should not be a standard format for providing</textblock>
    <textblock>this information to prospective students.</textblock>
    <textblock>[Kansas City, New York, Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>•The institution should use the States required format</textblock>
    <textblock>for providing consumer data to students. If the</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary requires additional information, the</textblock>
    <textblock>information should be consistent with the formats that</textblock>
    <textblock>the institution already uses. [Kansas City]</textblock>
    <textblock>C. Section 487(a)(13) provides that an institution may not deny</textblock>
    <textblock>Federal financial aid to an eligible student because the student</textblock>
    <textblock>is studying abroad in a program approved for credit by the home</textblock>
    <textblock>institution.</textblock>
    <textblock>Issues that the community was asked to address and the</textblock>
    <textblock>community's views:</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Should a consortium agreement be required?</textblock>
    <textblock>•A consortium agreement should not be required.</textblock>
    <textblock>[Kansas City, San Francisco]</textblock>
    <textblock>•A consortium agreement should be used for pre-approved</textblock>
    <textblock>work. Institutions need to ensure that two</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions are not giving aid at the same time.</textblock>
    <textblock>[New York]</textblock>
    <textblock>•A consortium agreement should be required if the</textblock>
    <textblock>student is paying tuition at the home institution and a</textblock>
    <textblock>second institution is involved. Otherwise no consortium agreement should be required. [Atlanta]</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Does the study-abroad program have to be part of the</textblock>
    <textblock>student's program at the home institution?</textblock>
    <textblock>•The study abroad program need not be a part of the</textblock>
    <textblock>student's program at the home institution, but must</textblock>
    <textblock>count toward a degree at the institution.</textblock>
    <textblock>[Kansas City]</textblock>
    <textblock>•The study abroad program should be a part of the</textblock>
    <textblock>student's home program. [San Francisco, Atlanta]</textblock>
