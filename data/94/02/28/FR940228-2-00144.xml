    <textblock>Each project must:</textblock>
    <textblock>(a) Make use of research and the experience of projects that have achieved success in the area of the priority.</textblock>
    <textblock>(b) Collaborate in the planning and operation of the project with the State science teachers' association and/or the State mathematics teachers' association and with at least one other party such as a school, an educational institution, a local or state educational agency, a national education organization, a science-technology center, or a private sector party; with these other parties, develop plans for continuing project activities after Federal support has ended.</textblock>
    <textblock>(c) Evaluate lessons learned from the project and use them to improve activities on a continuing basis.</textblock>
    <textblock>(d) Disseminate lessons learned to interested parties. Dissemination must begin while the project is in progress and use electronic as well as other forms of communication.</textblock>
    <textblock>(e) In the case of projects serving elementary and middle schools, increase teachers' own mastery of mathematics and science in order to increase their confidence and skill in teaching these subjects (including skills in providing hands-on learning).</textblock>
    <textblock>(f) Involve parents and community members as role models and/or mentors for female and minority children.</textblock>
