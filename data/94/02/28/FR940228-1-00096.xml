  <text>
    <textblock>In addition to modifying and expanding some of the existing</textblock>
    <textblock>administrative capability standards, and making others explicit,</textblock>
    <textblock>the Secretary proposes to expand the administrative capability</textblock>
    <textblock>standards to include the general areas that SPREs will review</textblock>
    <textblock>when they become operational. The Secretary realizes that the</textblock>
    <textblock>SPRE review standards must be developed in consultation with</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions located in the State and will apply only to those</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions that trigger reviews; therefore, those standards may</textblock>
    <textblock>differ greatly from those proposed here for purposes of</textblock>
    <textblock>evaluating an institution's administrative capability. However,</textblock>
    <textblock>the Secretary believes that these areas of review have a</textblock>
    <textblock>significant bearing on an institution's administrative capability</textblock>
    <textblock>and therefore should be incorporated in the Federal</textblock>
    <textblock>administrative capability standards.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary's overriding concern is that the Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>have sufficient information on which to make a determination that</textblock>
    <textblock>a new or currently participating institution is administering or</textblock>
    <textblock>is capable of administering the Title IV, HEA programs</textblock>
    <textblock>efficiently, effectively, and correctly. With this in mind, the</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary solicits comments on specific ways to quantify these</textblock>
    <textblock>provisions (for example, what a ``significant number of students</textblock>
    <textblock>with special needs'' is) and whether each of these added</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements should be made applicable to all institutions or</textblock>
    <textblock>whether these provisions should be made applicable only to</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions that meet specific criteria or thresholds, e.g.,</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions with short-term programs, a history of high</textblock>
    <textblock>withdrawal rates, high default rates, student complaints, etc.</textblock>
    <textblock>Specifically, the Secretary is proposing to require</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions that enroll significant numbers of students with</textblock>
    <textblock>special needs to have and implement a plan that provides access</textblock>
    <textblock>to adequate support services for those students. The Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>believes that an institution that cannot provide adequate</textblock>
    <textblock>peripheral support should not enroll those special-needs students</textblock>
    <textblock>in significant numbers. In evaluating administrative capability,</textblock>
    <textblock>the Secretary has looked historically at withdrawal rates. High</textblock>
    <textblock>withdrawal rates often result in refund and default problems in</textblock>
    <textblock>the FFEL programs. Some institutions have high withdrawal rates</textblock>
    <textblock>because they have recruited students who were not able to</textblock>
    <textblock>complete the program. Student withdrawal for academic reasons</textblock>
    <textblock>has been addressed by changes to the ability-to-benefit</textblock>
    <textblock>provisions: students who do not have a high school diploma or the</textblock>
    <textblock>recognized equivalent now need to pass an independently</textblock>
    <textblock>administered, approved examination. However, other students who</textblock>
    <textblock>have been admitted have had the academic capability to succeed,</textblock>
    <textblock>but have been unable to complete the program because of other</textblock>
    <textblock>factors, such as lack of child care, or changes in child care</textblock>
    <textblock>arrangements, or lack of adequate transportation. Some of the</textblock>
    <textblock>negotiators provided the Secretary with examples of students who</textblock>
    <textblock>could not complete a course of study because of a lack of</textblock>
    <textblock>information about how to access adequate support services, who</textblock>
    <textblock>otherwise may not have enrolled in those programs if accurate</textblock>
    <textblock>information about the restricted availability of those services</textblock>
    <textblock>had been disclosed. For example, if a school enrolls a</textblock>
    <textblock>significant number of students who have small children and,</textblock>
    <textblock>therefore, need someone to look after their children while they</textblock>
    <textblock>are in classes and studying, or students who have no</textblock>
    <textblock>transportation of their own, it is incumbent upon the institution</textblock>
    <textblock>to work with these students to ensure they have access to the</textblock>
    <textblock>ancillary services required in order for them to complete their</textblock>
    <textblock>education or training. The institution may, but need not,</textblock>
    <textblock>actually provide the specific services, such as child care, but</textblock>
    <textblock>must, at a minimum, provide adequate guidance and access to</textblock>
    <textblock>enable their students to overcome barriers to attendance.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary is proposing that affected institutions have a</textblock>
    <textblock>plan, which they may be asked to submit, to demonstrate that they</textblock>
    <textblock>meet this provision. However, the Secretary is interested in</textblock>
    <textblock>receiving suggestions about other ways to address the problem of</textblock>
    <textblock>institutions that recruit and enroll significant numbers of</textblock>
    <textblock>students who need support services without informing those</textblock>
    <textblock>students about access to the support services. The Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>solicits comments regarding how to determine what constitutes a</textblock>
    <textblock>``significant number'' of students with special needs and what</textblock>
    <textblock>special needs should be included. Further, the Secretary would</textblock>
    <textblock>like to receive proposals for alternate means of addressing this</textblock>
    <textblock>issue.</textblock>
