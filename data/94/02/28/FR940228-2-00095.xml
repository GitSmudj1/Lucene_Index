    <textblock>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</textblock>
    <textblock>The following is a summary of the application. The complete application may be obtained for a fee from the SEC's Public Reference Branch.</textblock>
    <textblock>Applicant's Representations</textblock>
    <textblock>1. Applicant is an internally managed, diversified closed-end registered investment company. As of December 31, 1993, applicant had outstanding 3,875,600 shares of common stock. Applicant's common stock is quoted on the NASDAQ National Market System.</textblock>
    <textblock>2. Before March 26, 1993, applicant was licensed to operate as a small business investment company (``SBIC'') under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended, and provided long-term, primarily variable rate, secured loans to finance the growth, expansion, and modernization of small businesses. Applicant was granted an exemption from various provisions of the Act and the rules thereunder to permit it to create a holding company structure.</textblock>
    <textblock>The purpose of the holding company structure was to allow applicant to expand its business beyond that of an SBIC. Although applicant is no longer an SBIC, it will continue to provide secured loans to finance the growth, expansion, and modernization of small business entities.</textblock>
    <textblock>3. On March 26, 1993, applicant transferred its SBIC license to Bando McGlocklin Small Business Investment Corporation (the ``Subsidiary''), a Wisconsin corporation, under a plan of reorganization under section 351 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the ``Code''). Under the plan, virtually all of applicant's assets were transferred to the Subsidiary; virtually all of applicant's liabilities were assumed by the Subsidiary; and all of the issued and outstanding shares of the Subsidiary's common stock were issued to applicant. Since March 26, 1993, substantially all of applicant's business has been conducted through the Subsidiary.</textblock>
    <textblock>4. As an internally-managed investment company, applicant employs its own personnel and advisory staff. Applicant currently maintains two incentive stock option plans in accordance with two orders issued to applicant when it was an SBIC.</textblock>
