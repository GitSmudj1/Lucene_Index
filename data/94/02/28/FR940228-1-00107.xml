    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to define a student attending an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution for the first time as a student who has not</textblock>
    <textblock>previously attended at least one class at the institution. A</textblock>
    <textblock>student who received a refund of 100 percent of his or her</textblock>
    <textblock>tuition and fees (less any permitted administrative fee) under</textblock>
    <textblock>the institution's refund policy for previous attendance at the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution would also be considered a first-time student.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary believes that a first-time student at an</textblock>
    <textblock>institution is a student who is attending that institution, as</textblock>
    <textblock>opposed to any institution, for the first time. Therefore, if</textblock>
    <textblock>the student has not previously attended at least one class at a</textblock>
    <textblock>specific institution, the Secretary would consider the student to</textblock>
    <textblock>be attending that institution for the first time. If a student</textblock>
    <textblock>transfers to another institution, he or she would count as a</textblock>
    <textblock>first-time student at the new institution, if he or she has not</textblock>
    <textblock>previously attended at least one class at the new institution.</textblock>
    <textblock>If a student attends an institution, withdraws from the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution (and receives less than a 100 percent refund), and</textblock>
    <textblock>then returns to the same institution, the student would not be</textblock>
    <textblock>treated as a first-time student for his or her second period of</textblock>
    <textblock>attendance. The Secretary believes that if a student has</textblock>
    <textblock>previously received a 100 percent refund at an institution, for</textblock>
    <textblock>purposes of this definition, the student should be treated as if</textblock>
    <textblock>he or she had not previously attended the institution.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes that a student should remain a</textblock>
    <textblock>first-time student until the student withdraws from the</textblock>
    <textblock>institution after attending at least one class, or completes the</textblock>
    <textblock>period of enrollment for which he or she has been charged,</textblock>
    <textblock>whichever occurs first. Therefore, the shortest amount of time a</textblock>
    <textblock>student could remain a first-time student is the period until he</textblock>
    <textblock>or she withdraws after attending one class. The longest amount</textblock>
    <textblock>of time a student could remain a first-time student is the period</textblock>
    <textblock>until his or her completion of the period of enrollment for which</textblock>
    <textblock>he or she has been charged.</textblock>
    <textblock>The Secretary proposes to adopt for all the Title IV, HEA</textblock>
    <textblock>programs the requirement currently found in the FFEL program</textblock>
    <textblock>regulations that an institution's payment to a lender of the</textblock>
    <textblock>portion of a refund allocable to a Title IV, HEA program cannot</textblock>
    <textblock>be delayed because of a delay in the return of equipment. The</textblock>
    <textblock>provision would apply to the portion of the refund due to any</textblock>
    <textblock>Title IV, HEA program.</textblock>
    <textblock>In the actual calculation of a refund under the</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund provisions of section 484B of the HEA, the amount of the</textblock>
    <textblock>refund is based on ``the portion of the period of enrollment for</textblock>
    <textblock>which the student has been charged that remains [after the</textblock>
    <textblock>student stopped attending].'' Under the law, ``the portion of the</textblock>
    <textblock>period of enrollment for which the student has been charged that</textblock>
    <textblock>remains'' in an educational program measured in credit hours is</textblock>
    <textblock>determined by dividing the number of weeks that the student did</textblock>
    <textblock>not complete by the total number of weeks in the program. For a</textblock>
    <textblock>clock-hour program, the determination is made by dividing the</textblock>
    <textblock>number of clock hours not completed by the total number of clock</textblock>
    <textblock>hours. For a correspondence program, the determination is made</textblock>
    <textblock>by dividing the number of lessons not completed by the total</textblock>
    <textblock>number of lessons. The Secretary has merely repeated that</textblock>
    <textblock>language here. The Secretary would like to note that ``the</textblock>
    <textblock>portion of the period of enrollment for which the student has</textblock>
    <textblock>been charged that remains'' is used to calculate the</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund to a student and is distinct from the determination of the</textblock>
    <textblock>60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for which</textblock>
    <textblock>the student has been charged that is used to determine whether</textblock>
    <textblock>the</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund calculation is applicable. The definition of</textblock>
    <textblock>``the 60 percent point in time in the period of enrollment for</textblock>
    <textblock>which the student has been charged'' was discussed earlier in the</textblock>
    <textblock>summary.</textblock>
    <textblock>Period of Enrollment for Which the Student Has Been Charged</textblock>
    <textblock>Generally, the Secretary proposes to define ``the period of</textblock>
    <textblock>enrollment for which the student has been charged,'' as the actual</textblock>
    <textblock>period for which an institution charges a student. However, the</textblock>
    <textblock>Secretary proposes to establish a minimum period of enrollment</textblock>
    <textblock>for which the student has been charged to prevent institutions</textblock>
    <textblock>from establishing very short periods to minimize the program</textblock>
    <textblock>charges that would be subject to</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refunds for first-time</textblock>
    <textblock>students. In the case of an educational program that is measured</textblock>
    <textblock>in credit hours and uses semesters, trimesters, quarters, or</textblock>
    <textblock>other academic terms, the minimum period would be the semester,</textblock>
    <textblock>trimester, quarter, or other academic term. In the case of an</textblock>
    <textblock>educational program that is measured in credit hours and does not</textblock>
    <textblock>use semesters, trimesters, quarters, or other academic terms, or</textblock>
    <textblock>an educational program that is measured in clock hours, the</textblock>
    <textblock>minimum period would be the lesser of the length of the</textblock>
    <textblock>educational program or an academic year. This proposed</textblock>
    <textblock>definition is based on the current policy for the FFEL programs</textblock>
    <textblock>that sets minimum certification periods for loans. This policy</textblock>
    <textblock>was designed partly to prevent institutions from circumventing</textblock>
    <textblock>the refund provisions currently found in ยง668.22. The Secretary</textblock>
    <textblock>invites comments on whether other safeguards are needed to</textblock>
    <textblock>prevent institutions from circumventing the</textblock>
    <textblock>pro rata</textblock>
    <textblock>refund</textblock>
    <textblock>requirements.</textblock>
