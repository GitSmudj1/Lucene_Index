    <textblock>FRA Waiver Petition Docket Number RST-93-3</textblock>
    <textblock>Notice is hereby given that the Burlington Northern Railroad Company (BN) has submitted a petition requesting that the use of ``Bulldog'' Clamps be approved for an additional two years. BN had previously been granted a waiver of the requirements of portions of the Track Safety Standards (49 CFR part 213) to allow the carrier to apply Bulldog Clamps to certain internal rail defects in lieu of conventional rail joint bars on certain BN line segments. See 55 FR 50266 and 56 FR 13515. BN is presently required to remove the clamp within five days of its application to the rail. If the internal defect has not been removed in that time, bolted joint bars have to be applied. In its petition, BN also requests that the five day period be increased to twenty days.</textblock>
    <textblock>FRA is seeking information and comments from all interested parties and are invited to participate in this proceeding through written submissions. FRA does not anticipate scheduling an opportunity for oral comment because the facts do not appear to warrant it.</textblock>
    <textblock>All written communications concerning this petition should identify the appropriate docket number (e.g., Waiver Petition Docket Number RST-93-3) and must be submitted in triplicate to the Docket Clerk, Office of Chief Counsel, FRA, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590. Communications received before March 29, 1994 will be considered by FRA before final action is taken. All written communications concerning these proceedings are available for examination during regular business hours (9 a.m.-5 p.m.) in room 8201, Nassif Building, 400 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC 20590.</textblock>
