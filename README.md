CS412 - Lucene Indexing & Searching

> 'data' contains the data set to be searched. The files inside are sorted by year/month/day and are in XML format.

> 'index' contains the files generated by IndexFiles.java

> 'lib' contains the required Lucene libraries

> 'ecore_convertor' contains two classes which were used to convert the original data into XML as XML is significantly easier to work with. To use these classes they must be imported into an Eclipse Modelling Framework project.

If the eclipse project is throwing errors, chances are the Lucene libraries have not been added to the build path. Add the jars to the build path and it should fix it.
